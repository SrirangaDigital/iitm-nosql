    "Photographer": "C. Gourishankar - Gourishankar was born into a distinguished family on the 19th of September, 1936. As a professional photographer Gourishankar started off by doing event, wedding and industrial photography. As an industrial photographer he took black and white photographs of factories, buildings and machinery for a number of institutions. One such institution was Indian Institute of Technology, Madras. Sometimes he would even climb trees to get the perfect angle for his shot and wait there until the clouds in the sky had the perfect composition! His photographs were showcased in exhibitions at Madras Museum, the German Consulate and Alliance Francaise. Gourishankar continued his line of work until the age of 69 in 1995. He passed away in 2002."
