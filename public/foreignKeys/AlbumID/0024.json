    "Photographer": "Mr. C. Gourishankar (1936-2002); He was a multi disciplinarian. Geologist, photographer, writer, craftsman and artist are just some of the definitions that can be given to this man of versatile interests and professions. Above all, he was a perfectionist. In 1960, he took up Photography as a profession.  Gourishankar undertook a number of Black &#38; white Event and Industrial Photography projects. He took photographs of factories, buildings and machinery for a number of Institutions. One such institution was IIT, Madras. All through the 1960’s-70’s buildings and facilities mushroomed all over the campus. The campus was amok with dignitaries and a number of events were taking place. This is when Gourishankar stepped in to document the radical growth of the Institute. His first assignment at IIT Madras was to cover the Institute Day function, April 1961. Besides taking commissioned photographs, he enjoyed taking photographs of South Indian Iconography. His photographs were valued greatly for their perfection in terms of lighting and composition and were showcased in many an exhibition. "
