• '. With the whole campus literally agog with the secret, it 15
not far wrong to fa, "little' of this excitement bubble over into the
leaves of Campastimes, is it? We all know (and know that we should

not know too) that there has been an errant, one who has let his
greed for aids take the better of his senses, amongst those who have
passed out this year o We sincerely hope that, hencefortn, we would
have no occasion to even hear as a rumour, somebody trying to manipulate likewise. We all have come here through a decent procedure.
Let the going out, too be, of similar nature, rather than with a
helping hand or with lead around our feet.
