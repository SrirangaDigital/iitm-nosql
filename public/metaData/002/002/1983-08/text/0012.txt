please pennit this student to

raise a few questions on 'social consciousn~ssf: Should the

~ariou~ student~

Are the few student secretaries and the others who work for
better teacher-student rapport. to be considered irresponsible?
Is the NSS to be considered a defunct body in that its student
volunteers don't merit mention as socially conscious youngsters?
Haven't the students invariably adopted tne most reasonable
manner of express; ng thei'r demands?
Beneath t~e veneer of scepticism, most of t~e students do
f}elieve that the sent~r members of the faculty are genuinely
interested in tne students. But ill-conceived notions of the
student conscience hardly promote such beliefs.
Detraction from students' social consciousness could be one way
of justifying a ·code of conduct' with several unreasonable
restrictions on student freedom. So~ for its own good, 1et the
student community beware.
