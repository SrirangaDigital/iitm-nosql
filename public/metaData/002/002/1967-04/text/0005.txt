now that he could wave to 'and receive a smile

pointed -out in a crowd. Nobody has ever
. seen him giving proof of this.
Today he was tr.ying to get the attention
of a plain blue saree towards the rear left and
a yellow black stripes to the right side. As I
saw him turning his head from one side to the
other I resolved to buy a bottle of pain reliever for his neck.
I had lost faith in my Granny's sayings for
ever when we ls:ft the theatre. Nothing had
happened till then. There was something
else which surprised me. Ravi, normally
would grab every occasion to prove himself
smarter than others. Today he had not done
it yet.
Now came the tum. We wanted change
for a tenner. I took it to the shop nearby
and politely asked for change. I drew a blank.
Before I kne,V' what had happened, Ravi
entered the shop demanding a pack of Char~
minar, tenner in hand. Money and a packet
of cigarettes exchanged hands. A smile and
a scowl darted across the counter to the shopman. Exit Ravi and friend, smiling and
looking stupid respectively. I fancied I heard
the shopman chuckle.
I knew, Ravi did not smoke. What would
he do with the pack r Having been humbled,
I restrained myself from asking such a
question, for it would have put him one up.

We straved into a restaurant and came out
bursting
the seams, with Ravi's purse
lighter. Waiting at the bus.stop, I wondered
if my Granny had not been wrong this time
at least.
Now came the symptoms. We had been
waiting full eleven minutes for the bus which
was not coming. In fact, we were not destined
to catch a bus-for there drew up a grey
Ambassador. A respectable, bespectacled
• andhra' looking man was beckoning to
Ravi. A door opened and Ravi and I got in.
A pleasant introduction was made. It was
his uncle. A conversation ensued. The two
started speaking in Telugu. Telugu being a
foreign language to me I became interested
in the side show through the window.
The next thing I knew, the gentleman in
white was heatedly shouting and Ravi was
sunk against the upholstery and looking pale.
I tried my best to figure out what had happened. Ravi mumbled something feverishly
under his breath, which only made his uncle
raise his voice further. The car stopped near
the Adyar terminus and we got down silently.
I saw Ravi's uncle extend his hand and
Ravi reluctantly parted with the packet of
Charminar and avert his face.
My Granny could never be wrong. Well!
here is one of Ravi's adventures-a true one.
Ravi claims that he never went out with me
to a picture-never. He ridicules me by
asking who would ever take ME to a picture.
That's Ravi for you.

Thomas started it all with a welcome
speech for Mr. Achutha Menon, the Chief
Guest for the evening. Then it was the turn
of the ~arious gymkhana secretaries after
which the Director himself addressed us.
Mr. Menon told us how happy he was to be
with us that evening. Mrs. Sengupto, then.
proceeded to distribute the priz~s for the
earlier events.
We th~n~ got down to brass tacks and took
up wher~ we had left off the previous evening.
The Women's Polytechnic came on first with
a group dance. Then there was a 'harikatha'
through which all of us sat with nary a
whimper.
When Sudarsan M. C.'eed the YMCA and
in particular the Bhangra in, a titter emanated
from the audience. One cannot easily forget
Sidhu's imitation of a mechanical toy in a
bhangra item at a function some years ago.
Anyway all of us were in for a surprise.
It was a brilliant item, very vigorously and
enthusiastically done and at the end, our
hands were aching from all that cheering.
Stanley Medical were next and their entry
was a numerical group • The Falcons'. A
pity their guitar amps chose that moment
to be uncooperative, especially since there
were quite a few fair Stanleyans around all
set to cheer them. Tch I Tch I
.
Then it was the time of the heartless
casehardened one on the harmonica from
the CPT.' Where he was, maybe he couldn't
hear the audience. It -was now the turn 6f
the A.C. Tech. to impress us. Their rna,..
rathon Tamil play was.
nevertheless~
'delectable.
Solomon of the Guindy College was good
with his • Edelweiss'. Singing 'On the
Street where you live " he looked as patheiic
as Freddie himself.
M. I. T. was next with a real ' fourful
Hudth. • who was simply scintillating on the
mridangam. May be his being a presidential
award winner will explain things. It was no\Y
the turn of a monoactor, who was, at times
funny.
The School of Architecture began in style
with a I\;athak dance embellished by tricky
spotlighting. That>~ where they should have
signed off.:-while the going was good. Instead~
they went ahead with a skit of sorts-something about James Bond. If one had really tried
to keep track of the story, it would have been
very confusing but there was just no point in
doing that. Never very straight forwa,rd, it
got wilder' and wilder towards the end. Bits of
itJ I guess, were meant to be actually
thrilling. It was still nearer in spirit to a
Hitchcock mystery than a Bond film.
Christian College'S contribution came like
drink to a dying man. Kannan delighted the
audience with his imitation of several film.
actors. Rumour has it that he was persuaded
by well·wishers in the audience to put up
something-anything, since the official team
forgot to turn up.
The Presidency College band seemed to
have taken an overdose of catnip. They mixed
music with action and the result was something ludicrous. Finally the Institute Film
Technology came on with a play. It had,
I guess, something to do with the gendarmie
as cops seemed to be allover the stage at Ollce.
Our own boys were heroes too, in their own
\Vay. They would come, in between items,
as if to assure the audience that there were
still a few good things left in this world.
Sebastian and George Verghese were
delightful on the piano. Scintillating as usual
were the Beat-X. Shivakumar's Zulu dance
was spectacular. Bashir's rendering of
'Roman Guitar' on the harmonica drew an
encore from the enthralled audience. Ranjan
and the Kellys were good too but the star was
Shankar, their emcee, who was exceedingly
humorous.
A word of praise for the audience is perhaps
in order. They were on their best behaviour
and as Sudarsan put it' Just Great J That's
the IITian everyone knows.
