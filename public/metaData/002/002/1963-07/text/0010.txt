with his games that he had completely
forgotten about the girls.

When he suddenly

turned around after having got a ‘ Canon ’ he
was confronted by a host of girls, led of
course by no other person than Frank.
‘ This is a surprise,’ he muttered as they
came towards him. At ﬁrst he wanted to
talk to Frank but he was careful to avoid
meeting Michael’s eyes. Yet Michael was

‘ No,’ he said abruptly and then as though

He had been introduced to most of the

group. Frank must have guessed what
Michael was thinking about because every
moment he was playing on his feelings. He
wanted to keep Michael expectant till the
last. ‘ Oh, Mike, I almost forgot,’ he said,

‘please meet Suzie Fritz. Suzie! this is
Michael Cooper.’ His heart slipped a beat.
So this was the girl. She was a slender girl
of medium height and he guessed that her
age was about sixteen. She had a full round
face with ﬁne red natural lips to match them.
Her checks were smooth and were ﬂushed
extra pink with excitement. As he extended
his hands to greet her, he gazed into her
blue round shaped eyes.
They were
the most beautiful eyes he had ever seen.

He had never seen such clear blue eyes anywhere so pure and shining with innocence.
As he looked into them he was lost in their
midst. It seemed to him that he was on an
ocean of blue water. The sea was calm and
peaceful and somewhere from its depth
shone astrange light. Suddenly the expres—
sion in them changed and this change brought
him back to reality. Wait now those eyes
seemed to be saying something. Yes they
