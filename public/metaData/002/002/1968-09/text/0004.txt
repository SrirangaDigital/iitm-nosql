Mt. · F. Dieter ' VoUprccht, until lately
Director; Max Mueller Bhavan, 'Madras, does
not: !'need ' any' special introduction to the
students · and members of the staff of the
Indian Institute of Technology. The Institute ' Gymkhana' will particularly remember
him with gratitude for the numerous occasions
on which he made it possible for them to
present cultural programmes to the students
of the IlT which have been important landmarks in the activities of the Gym~ana.
Through his good offices the Institute had
the good fortune of witnessing some rare
shows. , The excellent Jazz music from the
South-west ' German Radio Orchestra in
NOvember' 1966, the Puppet shows by the
famous German team Albrecht Roser/Ina
von' Vacano and Denneborg and the several
interesting lectures by visiting German Professors like Dr. E. Jaeckel, Dr. R. Jochimsen,
Dr. H. Reitbock would be remembered long.
Recently the magic show provided by the
German magicians Werner Hornung and Axel
Velden was another proof of Mr. Vollprecht's
eagerness to keep the IIT within the sphere
of the cultural activities, which he has been
pla~ning for his own institu~e. with such
meticulous care. The authonttes of our
institute have always found in Mr. Vollpre~t
a very helpful friend.

Our institute joins the other friends of
Mr. Vollprecht in wishing him and his family
all success in his new assignment as the
Director of the Germ'an Cultural Institute at
Addis Ababa in Ethiopia.

'THE FRESHER'S

PROBLE1~

By
A. SAN KARAN
~ Am I glad to be back here!', sighed
young Moron Kumar.
, ' Why, Did you get ragged too much?'
'enquired BriUy Ant •••
. • Got ragged you say? Yes sir! And by a
batch of seven tough chaps I '.
Briny clucked in sympathy. He said,
'You must then report this incident! Do
you know their names? '
Moron said sadly, 'That is where the
'trouble lies. See, I know their nicknames.
But I do not know in which hostel each
resides.'
'Then it is impossible to report' I said
Mr. Ant.
e Oh No, see, 1 know that no two of them
are in the same hostel', said Moron Kumar,
hastily.
Now Mr. Brains dropped in. He said, 'I
know tliat the chap called Fatty is either in
Jamuna, Narmada or Tapti.'
'If he is not · in Narmada then either
Shorty or Gholti must be there.'
C Yes, but Shorty might also be in Jamuna
or Godavari' said Brains.
, Thadu ',said Brilly, • is either .in Saraswati or in Ganga. But he cannot be 10 Ganga
if Gholti is in Narmada.'
, • On the other hand', said Brains, C Raju
may be in,Saraswati or Krishna.'
, Reverting for a moment to Gholti " said
. Moron, 'Where can he be, if he is not in
Narmada ~'
, Godavari', said Brmy.
. 'That is right', said Brilly. 'Or again, he
might be in Tapti.'
C I still do not know where Haba is', said
Moron, 'Except that he cannot be in
Godavari.'
C And
he cannot be in Narmada', said
Brains. 'He might-though I doubt it-be
in Ganga or Krishna. But Kupz is in one or
other of those hostels.'
, Is that all we know?' asked Brilly.
, Not quite', said Moron. • Here are ~0ll?-e
more scraps of information. If ".Saba IS 10
Jamuna then Fatty is not in Tapti. And, if
Fatty is in Narmada, then Shorty cannot be
in Godavari.'

1.1. T.,·
(This is a poem by a member of our watch
altd ward who believes in modem vBI'se,)

1.1.T., the only plaee
In India can trace
Making young folk. brace
Knowledge by His grace.
I.l.T., has made a name,
Reached horizon the fame,
Great and small played the game,
Making all good and tame.
Application for admission,
After summer vacation,
Creates in all a tension,
To gain their aspiration.
Adhere to discipline strict,
Great ideals addict,
Brilliant folk do select,
Average fees collect.
Students are at home,
Like Ladies of Rome,
Discontentment even to soine,
Hard to trace in handsome.

Given that the freshers' information ' is
correct, can you help them in reporting the
atrocious ragging of young Moron to the
SPCF'1
Solution:
Call the CUlprits Fatty, Shorty etc., ',as
F, S, G, B, T. R, K.
Call Jamuna ,to Narmada ' z, Tapti '3,
Godavari 4, Saraswati 5, Ganga 6, and
Krishna 7.
Then we have 'these data:(r) F is in x, 2 Of 3.
(2) S is in I, 2 O,f 4.
(3) G is in 2. 3 or 4·
(4) T is in 5 or 6. } Hence T, Rand K
(5) R is in 5 or 7.
must be in 5,6 and 7
in some order.
(6) K is in 6 or 7.
(7) B is neither in 2 nor in 4 (and is therefore in. 'I OI 3.)
(8) If T is in 6, G is not in 2.
(9) If B is in 3. G is not in 4·
(xo) If B is in 1, F is 110t in 3.
(IX) If F is in 2, S is not in 4.
Now consider the group F, S, G, B. Or.
the basis of data (r), (2), (3), (4) we have
these possibilities.
abcdef

F can be in 1, 2, 3.
S can be in I, 2,4.
G canbein:a, 3,4.
B can be in 1, 3.

But of these 'a' and I 'c' are ruled out by
(9); 'd' by (II); and'c' and 'f'bY(lo).
' The only solution t confirming to the da,ta

But the second one is ruled out by (8).
Hence we get.:Fatty in Jamuna, Shorty in Godavari:

in Saraswati: Raju in Krishna and Kupz in
Ganga.
