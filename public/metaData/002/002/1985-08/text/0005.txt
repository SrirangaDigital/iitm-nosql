A spark in the viJtas 0/ m)' imagination,
Stopped me prancIng in a hood of passiotl.

W,ne'nl we all but boomerangs racing along,
T'" oug/t deserts of realtty strivinf to escape the pull.
Only to be brought back by a nalced gale.
Ahl 1 pit)' our futile flIghts though cosmos,
Hopmg 1o grasp a golden keel free a/moss,
But Jalldmg lVith a thud Ott blattk facts
shrouded Ifl deceptive alabaster.
Facts: that givehosllle stares Jacking a homel), fust".

It couldn't be othenHse
as it is the same atollls,
so 1 am told,
that make tlte air,
her thighs, my looks,
(he wltite's froll'n,
the black's 'lumU,ation,
the child's fear
the mother's al/ger
and my lines.
So the bf)nd comes
through the air
thaI carries the burden
of the ~ery many unsaid things.

And I have seen Godhe is everywhere
being made 0/ the slime atoms,
in the softness of her thighs,
in (he deszre o/my looks,

The clocks go anticlockwlSe

The coulltdown IS on
for the zero hour 0/ blast.

We came, restless
from the bottom of the blue seas,
bewitched by the greenery of the foresll.
We moved on, restless,
alJandol1lng the tree tops

From here
through the rarely opened wi"dows
the In()on is yet another electric bulb
hung hIgh alld dry.
The mISt IS mdlstmguishable
from mOISt eyes.
On the pavement below
the beggarC/uld's wail
begllls at Its end,
goes backlVard,
and ends
in hIS or/gma] hllnger,

The other point of view
AI dawn when the early bird sings,
I caclde lVith the excltementlhe morning brings,
I sWlfIg through the branches with a /(1t Of)oy,
â€¢ Climb lip the hostel drampIpes, my favou",e ploy.
Every willdolV has Its own view afparadlseBananas, oil bottles or perhaps boxes of spice
Oh wh It all adventure to rummage through t~se!
Oops! Be careful how you wave thaI stick, please!

in the tears a/my SOrt,

Qnd in my death that dislects me
ilJto my true elemental
atomic levels Of love.
It is all ill the air,
these unsaid fhmgs,

for you 10 feel,
if Oll/Y you have moments to spare
--when yotl aren't too busy marnng moneyto make .Jome love.
some sense,
some pass/on,

some life.
