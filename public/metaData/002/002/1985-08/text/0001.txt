Once Upon A Time. • •
When I was requested to wnte a small
arl1c1e or a note to CAMPASTlMES, I was
told not to make the note too formal,. hkehow glad 1 am to see a tnagazlOe of this type
commg out mainly doe to students' efforts,
how nice It IS to see the students engaging
themselves in such a creative effort, how the
magazlOt acts as a forum for "II that IS worthwhile, etc,' etc. Not that these are not true,
but the note would be so stereotyped that any
person even without taking a course on rapldread 109 could read the first sentence and get
" the entire gist. The article sbould be onglnal
and mterestmg, the boys said. I was also. told )
that after haVIng wntten a dozen booRs in
technical field, It shou1d not be too dIfficult
for me to write such a note That was when
the CAMPASTlMES representatives touched
upon a man'~ weak corner-the ego corner.
It was then that I fen a vicilm and committed _
mysefrto wnte a note. To be bonest, I did
make one or two attempts that evenmg to
write a note whIch was worthy of prlntmg,
worthy of readIng over and over again and
carrying a message that would be remembered
for a long time to come. Welt, the result was
shocking. The sheets of paper were torn IOto
shreds and found their way to the waste-paper
plas t1c bucket. Then, about three weeks
passed by qUietly and I conveniently forgot
an about it.
This inability or difficulty to write a
general but InterestlOg artlcle has been
nagglOg me for quite some time. Whenever
1 read Nick Carter or Carter Brown, though
t skip many pages (of course not tbe pages
giving graphic descnptions of animal instlOcts
and human weaknesses I), I get a feehng that
I could also very easily Write such books;
particularly when It IS mentioned 10 bold
pnnts on the cover page that more than three
mllhon copies have been sold. But, It IS
definitely not ewsy, This extraordinary tlllent,
to weave nothmg around notblDg, yet to fin
pages after pages and have them sold to
persons like you and me, IS, I beheve, a gift
that only a few people possess, The pamful
part IS to know that you are the three million
and oneth (or IS It three million and first or
3,000,001 th? ) person paying mlo Nick
Carter's bank account and what you gel in
return is the reahsatlOn that you are way
behlOd the race-ratber, not 10 the race at all.

I recall reading the statement of a very
sllccessful short-story writer saylDg the secret
is to have an interesting endlDg. With the
end in mind, you can keep weavlDg as
complicated a web as you want. 1 thlOk there
is some truth m thIs A few others say that
lyo" must have a tneme and around this theme

you can wo!ave a story. 1 have tned the latter
one, but without success.
A'l )'h::r InterestlDg and successful person
who IS capable of wntmg It:>thlng about
llothmg IS Art B4chwald. Choosmg seernIDgty ndlculous statements like "CIY Uncle,
Uncle" or 'Give aid ano sell more guns" or
"I ant a fund \m'!ntah~t", Art can do wonders. ,

1 have heard of free-lance writers and
editors and have often wondered what IS so
free either about their lanCing or writing.
I am told tlley are not seriOUS, commltted
autbors or wnters, that they wIlte ,casually;
that they are not profe~sloaals, etc. I have
tried to b~ c ome one, but without success.
I am convln~d I have to do som~ sertoUS
full-time wCltlDg before b::comlClg a sl.lcces.sJuL
free·lance writer. But those who kbow tell
m! It IS the other way around. You shoul4
succ(:ssfully free lance before becomlllg
professIOnal. ObViously, they do not want to
give OJt the s'!cr<!t, which IS first.
After havlOg been JQ the teacblllg profemon for more than twenty years, another
gro.lp of felloH tea.;h~rs who.n J admIre mJch
IS the H'J1l1'lllles and SJ;lal SCience teachers.
[ am considered to b! a fairly successful
teacher (I have to keep saying thiS as people
have a natural tendency to forget good thmgs
.about tbelr fellow Citizens and co-workers),
capable of explalDlOg 10 clear terms, the
axioms, assumptIOns, laws, prmclples and
mathematlcal denvatlOn. But, when I tned to
teach a course on Engineering DeSign, which
involved no denvatlon what so ever and I had
to stand facIDg the class and keep talking,
I had to let the class go WlthlO fifteen minutes.
These HSS teachers, Who keep talklOg hour
after hour, semester after semester, without
wntlOg a smgle sentence on the board,
defimtely deserve all our praise Close on the
heels of thIS group IS the management group.
But then, like Nick Carter and Carter Brown.
thiS IS a lucky group, atleast those who take
you for a fide As eagle said to crow "Don't
be Jealous, otherWise, the pangs of Jealousy
Will devour you". So, I try hard not to thlDk
of such people. I do not like compelltlon.
Well, coming to the specifics, what can
one write JD the way of an article to
CAMPASTIMES? I tTled analyslOg the name
(or title and whatever you may call It)
CAMPASTIMES as a sUitable tOPiC. Of
course, we all know that the spelllllg IS
ternble, but the boys told me It was
deliberate "You see It is Campus, and then
It has something to do with PastlOles, that IS

Writing an article to
