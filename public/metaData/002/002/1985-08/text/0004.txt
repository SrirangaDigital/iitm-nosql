says our true nature IS one in which everythlDg
appears as ONE.
Are the goals of a physicist and a painter
the same'?

Let me begm by asking you, how do you
react to an Intel view? Do you think they
serve any purpose?
I thUll" every mtervlI.'w IS a happenmg, a
phenomena. Yes, you cannot find out what
a person IS thmkIng by talkmg to him, but
there IS no other way If the questions are
real questions, very often the answers will be
real answerS. A successful intervIew IS one IQ
which an oneutation towards a specific subject
is created.

As a creative mdlvidual, what gives you
greater JOY: the abstraction of an idea or
the realizatIon of the Idea in the concrete?
I don't really see any dIstinction between
the abstract and the concrete. It, In some
sense depends on the person's orientation.
A dlfi'erentHll equatIon may be very abstract
for somebody wbo IS new to it, but for a
mathematicIan It is the natural way things
move in the world From my own experience,
I thlOk it IS not a question of dlstlOgulshlOg
betweeQ the abstract and the concrete,
but of finding connections between things
_ which you thought were unconnected. A
discoverer's delIght is to find the extraordinary
In the ordmary.

What IS for you, your 'truest emotion'
, your 'purest moment'?
It 15 difficult answenng thiS question In
mere words But, for me the greatest joy is
findJDg no difference between myself and the
world. It IS a kind of JOy, when space and
time have no meamng. The dIstance between
you and everythJDg else dIsappears Crudely
put, two fnends are hapPiest When neIther of
them is aware who lS dOlOg the queshonmg
and who lS doing the answenng. Nothtng IS
defined. Therefore, tradlhonal IndIan WIsdom

I have borrwed this beading from
the title of a famous book by
Arthur Koestler In hIs study of
the creatIve art Koestler advances
the theSIS that creatIOn, be It 10 art
or SCience, IS a 'blosoclatlve actthat IS, one in whIch an explOSive
meetmg of two apparently unconnected frames of reference occurs.
ThIS IS basl(;ally true, though I
would prefer to term It a 'multisociatIve' act.
A poem IS not somethmg that
sImply gets 'wl'ltten.' A poem
happens. A poem IS a ImguIsttc,
emotIonal and IDtellectual event.
Poetry IS to me a conCise, powerful,
Imagistic
abstractIOn
of the
expenence of reahty-not merely
nor even
predommantly
of
sentiments, which from only a part
of
human
experience.
What
matters to me is the authenticity of
this experience and the intensity
With wh,ch It is abstracted.

Such abstractIon of experience
III terms of Images can be detected
In any
worthwhIle poem. To
Illustrate the dommant Image in
the poem 'There are thlOgS unsaid
tn the aIr' IS that of aIr that 'carnes
the burden of unsaId thlDgs.' The
poem IS a commentary or analYSIS
of the complex multIdimenSional
modes of commUOlcatlOn that we
employ. The symbol of aIr evokes

I think, both phYSICS and painting are
modes of expression. By and large, a person
pamts because he sImply has to do It. ThiS IS
true for a SCientist, too. So I think, it's not
the goal but the act of domg that is more
important. For that matter, the same is true
about eatmg too. Why does one eat? Most
of the tIme while eating, one does not think
of Vitamins or fats but the sheer pleasure .of
eatmg IS enough to keep one gOing.
Is there anythmg hke fate'? Let me put
the question a httJe differently-Had you been
born m a different household would you stJlJ
have become a physicIst?
I am really not sure. [thtnk, at best if
the household had been very dIfferent, or
If I had been born 10 a family of polItIcians,
J probably would have been 10 polttIcs today.
But if the situahon in my household had
changed by a fintte amount, say. If my father
had been a CIVIl Engmeer or a banker, I
think I st1l1 nught have been a phYSICist.
Do you believe 10 god? Does a creatIve
individual have to beheve In god (in the sense
of an Infintte force)?
1 think thIS question is some what II/posed.

As a SCientist to the extent that a system is
subjected to sCientIfic analYSIS I would not
want a god to come and confuse the sClenhst
I lIke to look at god as a concept. It IS like
talkIng about a cloud. There IS no such th10g
as a cloud, there are only drops of water.
SImilarly It IS useful to talk about economic
forces, but the fact 15 that there IS no such
force.
There are electrtcal forces, magnetic
forces & gravItational forces but In reahty
there is nothIng Itke an economIc force.
look at god in a SimIlar way.

I think It IS nice to picture a god, but I
don't tbink It has any sClentfic or a phllosphic
base, at best it may have a poetic base.

But Isn't ~ disease Il'<e 'AIDS' proof of a
dlvme force telhng man to walk on the right
path?
No I don't look at 'AIDS' like that.
I look at It Just lIke any tndlvldual looks at a
complex system Whatever was not preViously
getting a chance to express Itself, v.ould
soonel or later do It. And AIDS happened
to be one of them.

Its vital role of supportmg lIfe in
the biological sense and is used to
underlme lts symbolIc role In the
emottonal and poetic sense as well.
The symbohsm gets developed
as we progress through the poem;
for IDstance death IS perceived
as a transformatIon of oneself IUtO
the atoms.
It IS a mistake to think that
these symboltsms and meantngs are
consciously or dehberately mtroduced. Not at all. At the tIme of
wrIting It OCcurs naturally WIthout
any conscIous effort. The poet
IS
then in a trance-lIke state
and the poem hterally flows It IS
an explosive outburst of Images,
meanmgs and
thoughts
that
somehow, at the moment of
creatIOn, come mto confluence.
The poems given here

probably less than ten mlOutes each
to wnte. It must have unconsCiously taken several months or
years for the 'raw matertals' to

the theory of evolution IS not just a tbeory
but a way of lookIng at thIngs. The question
IS not, whether a tbeory IS right or wrong
but whether It IS convenient or not; whether
it can answer the questlODs posed to it The
'theory of evolution' succeeds enormously in
this respect.
Who are the people who have inspired
you? Who were your heroes?
It's a btUe dIfficult to answer this question,

Newton would be one of them.
Adi

modern world, it's very difficult to make
such a chOice.
Has fame affected the quality of your

Yes, and No. it bas affected me in a

care has described in detall his
discovery of the class of Fuchslan
functIOns. In an mtUltJve leap of
ImagmatlOn, as If In a flash, he saw
the eXIstence of thiS mathemattcal
senes. The phYSical settmg was
Simply unscholarly-he was actually
boardtng a bus at the tIme. Most
fundamental creahve tncldents In
mathematiCs or sCience occur In
the same fashion-not through dehberate logical thought processes, but
through explOSive, mulusoClahve
trance-ltke 'vlslon'-lf you like.
JUst as the symbohsms and the
images of a poem can be worked
out subsequently for Its logIC (a
logIC naturally different from that of
sCIence) and meaDlngs, the mathematiCian's VISion of a theorem or
a sCIentist's dIscovery IS worked
out, SUbsequent to the act of
creatIOn, by conscIous reasonmg or
expenmentatlOn.
Fmally then, what makes a POtt?
~ would say, an above average
Intensity of senslblltty, a love of
words and phrases and a deep
grasp of their connotations and
their pO~slblht1es in evokIng images,

a fresh almost chlldhke way of
100k1Og at the world and above aU
a certam propensity fo\, theoretIcal
abstraction.
Now why do I write? It is
almost like a~kmg why do we laugh
when we are happy or yawn when
we are bored? WrJtlDg poetry JS,
or atleast It should be, a natural act
the poet mdulges in when he has
the poehe 'kick'. The process of
wntmg then IS an excIting, pleasurable and even exhausting act hke
say, sex. In short, the why of poetry
lIke the whv of seX-If there 1-5
any -IS ununportant. Of course,
the poem IS meant to be read or
hstened to and apprecIated by
others. So I make It as Ititelhglble
as pOSSible, for Instance by eschewing purely personal Images. Bllt
tbls sIfting or edltmg goes on
rather unconsciously at the tIme
of wntmg. I enJoy Immensely
readmg my poems to my !Dtlmate
clrcle of fnends who have an ear
for poetry. ReaJlOg makes the
poem come ahve; on the page It is
rather tame. Ted Hughes wrote
'When all the words are heanng
each other clearly. and every stress
is feeling every other stress and
all are contented-the poem is
fllllshed.' The poem nse~ to this
dimenSIon, I believe, only when
read aloud,
