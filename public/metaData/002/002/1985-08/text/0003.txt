"The sense of aesthetics is another sense tilat needs to be nourished. For example, if you don't read poetry you don't
miss any tiling. but when you read it, you understand how much you are missing ".
-that was Prof. A. N. Sengupta, a warm and sincere person eager to share his experience with others. There
is a fictitious quality about his REALITY-almost like a fairy tale-not everyone enjoys a journey which includes halts
at liT (KGP), North Carolina State University, M.I.T., Tulanne University, Harvard, University of Montreal among other way
stations. Inspired by people like Frank Lloyd Wright, Le Corbusier and Walter Gropius, he has ventured to become one
of the eminent architects ill the country. He is currently teaching at 1I1e School of Architecture, Guindy.
HERE IS A GLIMPSE OF HIS ARTIS flC TEMPERAMENT .......... ..
