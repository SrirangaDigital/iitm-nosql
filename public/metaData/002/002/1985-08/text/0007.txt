people assocIate 10\ e "ith a red heart
punctured by a s\lpple aHUV. In
fact It IS a sign of falal IOJUry.
More often th,1ll not, the drops
of blood thai should have been
dnppmg, are left to the ImaginatIOn of the reader The creatne
gemus who thought of thIs plctOgram must have been a senSitive
young man who had a rather
naughty encounter with. a touch
and go girL Or It could have been
a paSSlonate lady who had a boyfflend With a heart-attack. Anyway
it seems obvIOUS that the symbol
under diSCUSSion has a tragIc
background.
On closer inspection and
tboughtful mtrospectIon of the
Cupids InslgDla, I am left With
many doubts which have often
caused weeks of lDsomOla. The
POSItion of the arrow Itself has
been left ambiguous. Bewg an
engineer, I am used to precise
specificatIOns and as such I have
a long-standIng urge to find out
the chamber through which the
arrow passes-the auncle or the
ventncle. I am try Lng hard to
arrtve at an answer. L have so far
referred to about 5 volumes of
cn~) clopedla BntanOlca, 10 vol.
Llm~~ of Chamber'S Encyclopedia
all'" 7 volumes of Encyclopedld.
Am'cicana. But all this hasn't got
11'10 anywhere. In fact It ha~ led
to more queries, Is It pOSSible at
.It to convey gradations In love?

For example
a heart WIth a
through hole to mdlcate that the
arrow has npped past and landed
on the other Side. Can love be
represented by a purple heart?
Can the anow be replaced by a
bullet from a 0 36 or a 0.303.
Such questIons have led me
Into a VICIOUS CIrcle and I sincerely
hope I would get out of It fast.
In the meantIme If any of the
readers, have the answers to my
queries, I request them to WrIte to:
