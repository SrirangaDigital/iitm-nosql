HOW

TO

A most brilliant example of Originality In
thiS field was first reported just a few years
ago. It consists of stating a lengthy law In
one breath, looking disappointed when
several crIes of "Uhhhh?",
Whazzat?",
"What the ........ " are heard, walkmg over to
the board with a reSigned expreSSion, and
With great dignIty wntlng :

LECTURE
EFFECTIVELY

NEWTON'S LAW OF
UNIVERSAL GRAVITATION

The beglnnmg of the lecture serves to
cre_te the atmosphere of the whole, hence It
IS Imperative that from the very start you
make It known once and for all that you are
Top Dog. This may be done 10 several ways.
The most direct approach is to start the
lecture five minutes early, before all the
students have had a chance to amve. This
automatically establishes you as a "Let's not
mess around" type. Any dissenting murmurs can be subdued WIth a mumbled "We
have a lot to cover, and, anyway, you mIssed
a lecture at Thanksgiving." The beauty of
thIs method IS that It can also be used to
make students feel gUilty and Ill-at-ease.
This IS done by waltmg until the rest of the
class starts straggllOg 10 and, when the
IneVitable floor-board creaks, turning around,
surveymg the class With an ICY stare and then
mumbling something like" . . don't mind
•• coming In late ....... but some people
...... more conSiderate .... 1"
Another very effective opemng IS to
deSCribe the traffiC jam commg down from
the house and to follOW this With some
derogatory remarks about the traffic police
or the automobIle manufacturers. This invariably sets you up as a good Joe, an allright guy, and "qulte a character, eh?
A techmque favourite among lecturers of
subjects connected in any way With
mathematiCs consists of commg 10 early,
standmg at the board With the back to the
class, and manIpulating With very complicated mathematical expressions. These are
rubbed off about a mmute before lecture
time, but by then most of the students will
have seen them and a general feeling of
apprehenSion Will have been created. The
lecturer IS then looked on as the one who
will translate these hieroglyphics of higher
learning for the academiC cavemen of the
class.
In delIvering the lecture you should keep
In mllld that the mode of delivery depends
on the subject matter. In general, subjects
can be divided IOta three branches; the
dIfficult. the tTicky, and the easy. These
are further divided Into the largely bormg.
the mildly interesting, and the very interestIng However, because of the very rare
occurrence of the latter category, the diS.
cusslon here Will be limited to the former
two.

(II) ";ffic"lt~

lllrgeill buring
These subjects constitute a high percentage of the work done here. It IS vital that
the lecturer not enter Into a dISCUSSion of the
tOPIC With any indiVidual student. This
can generally be avoided by covering the

matellal at a rate so great that all of the
class' attentIOn IS focused on the boddy
transfer of the work from the board to the
notes.
Sometimes, however, a question IS asked.
In thiS emergency the follOWing treatment IS
recommended:
1.

Ignore It.

2.

Look disgusted.
ThiS often makes the
student feel self-conSCIous and may
result In hiS utter defeat Immediately.

3.

Repeat what you have said In the last
five mlOutes, but do It In thIrty seconds.

4.

Start diSCUSSing a completely Irrelevant
pomt.

5.

Bring hIm to his knees by mfefTIng that
he IS an IdiOt. e.g. : "But after all,
Mr. Guggenkopf, Isn't two plus two
Just four?"

6.

Make the student repeat the question
several times while you look at the
class With a pleading expression. ThiS
suggests at once that he mumbles, does
not enunCiate, or cannot express
himself clearly.
NOTE: In the case of foreign students
thIS method should be used first.

7.

If there seems to be no other way out
resort to the technique involVing
Thanksgiving" already mentioned
above.

(II) Diffic."t,

mildly interesting
ThiS category rncludes a fairly large number of subjects which reqUire blackboard
presentatIon. Although the methods dIScussed for (a) find Wide applICation m thiS
field, the content of thiS section will deal
mainly With the cardmal tOPIC of blackboard techlque.
Two separate cases occur here:

1.

Good text-book IS readily available.

2

No Single text covers the work

1. Since It IS necessary to give only supplementary details on the board you have here
a golden opportunity to assert your personality. The most Important characterIstic to
develop IS the writing It should be small,
espeCially effectIve In big rooms, and
hovering on the bnnk of Illegibility

To see the blank expresSIons on their faces
before somebody figures out "The force of
attraction ...... " is one of lIfe's rare little
pleasures.
Another gratifYing result IS obtained by
writing a complicated expression on the
board and then With a chalk eraser rapidly
WIPing and altering inverting and cancelling
until the answer IS arrived at. ThiS will
ineVItably bnng great cries from the students,
You can mterpret them as signs of admiration
for the rapIdity of your mental processes.
2. In thiS case It is necessary to prOVide a
reasonable amount of mformatlon by means
of the blackboard.
One highly recommended procedure for
keeping one step ahead of the class consists
of commencing to wTlte Immediately on
com 109 10 and contmumg to do so until the
very end of the lecture. The wrltmg should
be accompanied by a runnmg commentary
mto the board, enunCiation shOUld be lImited
to the result of any sequence of operations
deSCribed.
e.g. ·'••• mlpycrossringlefslnvidlOgbtwofrens
hateonce-get x I"
Another popular method is the WPTT pro=cedure. The technIque consists of the
above With addItion of steppmg back,
looking at the board, steppmg forward,
wrltmg another Ime, and saymg ·' ...... whlch
proves the theorem." Fifteen
seconds
later the boards are wiped clean. Ensumg
questions are treated as per (a) above. The
psychological effects of thiS on the students
are too obVIOUS to warrant diSCUSSion.
When properly used, the black board
eraser can be an effectIve tool in establishing
the lecturer's supeTloTlty. Great effects
have been achieved by not erasing the
prevIous work completely and wTltlng
between the smudges, not erasmg the preVIOUS work at all and wTltmg on top of It,
erasmg each line fIfteen seconds after It
was written, puttmg extra Imes 10 the
middle of completed sectIons preferably on
an angle. and wTltmg on a wet board With
hard chalk.

(e) Tr;c/~y,
largelll boring
Here It is often necessary to explam some
obscure pomt to a student. However, thIS
can also be used as a tool to affIrm your
supertortty over the class. In preference to
the methods outlined 10 (a) we suggest the
"further research" technique,
