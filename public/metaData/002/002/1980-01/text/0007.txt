{NadIa) the team consists of hIghly enthuSIastiC and gifted gymnasts like H S S MaO!,
George Val lath, Hebbar and Pandlan lnsplte
of many controversIal deCISions which baffl_

Indeed there IS hope for us In the future.

4th day

Among the Issues In this campus that
never falls to provoke heated debate and
controversy IS the Inter 1.1 T. Its protagonists
claim that It IS a natural culminatIOn of phySical actIvItIes In oach InstItute and that the
objectIve of the meet IS to bung together the
students of various I I Ts and to foster a
closer aSSOcIatIOn and undelstandmg among
them through sport actIvities The CritICS
rebut thiS, claIming that Instead of friendship
and camaraderie the meet fosters bad blood
and unhealthy rivalry among the students;
beSIdes the standard IS abyssn'ally low and
the quality of sport actiVities does not Justify
the huge amount spent on It The truth lies
somewhere In-between. Also It IS a totally
different experience actually attending the
meet and bemg In the thIck of things. It IS
then that you undergo the tension and excite·
ment over fluctuating fortunes The bonds
and links formed due to a common objective
to Win are those that endure In the heat
of the moment concepts like sportsmanship,
fairplay are forgotten for the goal IS to Win
No matter what the cost No one likes to
Jose, least of all an IlTian ThiS no doubt
explainS the ratIOnale behmd various acts
Whlen ~n hindSight may appear unjustlfl6d.
As far ~mpastlmes was concerned 8 new
pr edent was set of bnnglng aut dally
bulletinS (excerpts of which are printed
elsewhere In thiS Issue)
ThiS year In order to reduce expendItUre
the coaching camp was reduced to 10 days A
notable pOint was the sense of responSibility
and diSCipline which was prevalent among
the sportsmen and the way In which they
practIsed ThiS exploded the myth that
coaching camps are usually utilised for
hogging and relaXing at Gymkhana expense,
Our Journey seemed Jinxed for the bus we
were travelling In broke down before WEI
reached the .gate. Worse things were to
Come although we dldn t realisE' It then.
Our bogey. for God knows what reason,
was dehnked at Jhansl Suddenly In the
middle of the night we were stranded In the
middle of nowhere I Anyhow we managed to
reach DeIhl late In the evening totally
dramed out.

1st day:
There was an air of expectancy tinged
With apprehenSion. The thought uppermost
10 everyone's mmd Will we make It 7 lhe
first event of the day was the inauguration
function The band was ImpreSSive (RaJputana "fles) the march past was not We
converged on the athletiCS ground Sridhar
qualifIed for the 1OOM fmals With a timing
of 11.3 sees So did Natarajan (Bull) for
the 400M. In the high jump, Moses Venkl
and Radhaka'lt got 2nd, 3rd and 4th places.
In Shot Put Chief got a bronze But the
best effort came from v· \/Vho won the gold
medal In the 5000M Insplte of a hprculean
effort James Mathew gOt the bronze The
tenniS match agaInst Kanpur W'lS a str alght
wm for us. Veterans 'Ike Kastun Digi

Ulla!. Kunle were too good for their OppOSU
tlon A heartening feature was the new
find Ramesh who looked as good as any of
th<>m In Kabaddl we lost to KGP. The
footer match against KG P was a fast hardfought game We were distinctly unlucky
to lose But the shock of the day was In
hockey when we lost to Kanpur ThiS
unexpecteo defeat depre<sed the entire
contingent But our SPIritS lifted With the
volleyball results where Moses aud Co made
mincemeat of the opprSltlon (KGP). The
same profeSSIOnal and ruthlel>s approach was
eVIdent by the way Khatri, Kamath and
RangaraJan deCimated
the oppOSitIOn
(Delhi). We lost Badminton (both men and
Women) to Kanpur Ravi won hiS Singles
and doubles Although Mlhnd and Ashok
were good they became nervous and made
mistakes. The Basketball match against
Bombay seemed a farce for both teams knew
what the result would be We won comfortably In the cncket match against Bambay
after a bad start we rallied to make a good
score All In all It was a day of mixed
fortunes for us

2nd day
Once agam It IS v\' who freaks out thiS
time In the 1500M
Mathew got a Silver
ThiS chap IS fast
and Bucket came 4th
Improving and may SOOn surpass v~ himself
NataraJan (8ull/ got a bronze In the 400.
In TenniS It was the same old story (3-0)
thiS time vs Deihl. A supreme effort by
Khatri helped us wm Table-tenniS (Vil Kanpur)
5-3 But m T T (Women) we lost to Bombay
whIch had a state player In Kabaddl we
lost heaVily to Bombay. A small consolation
was that we licked Bombay In volleyball.
Another shock was OUT second defeat m
hockey, thiS time to DeIhl, In a match marred
by mCldents The basketball match agamst
Kanpur proved to be exciting WIth Kanpur
puttmg up a stiff fight A spirited effort by
RaJu saw us Win (64.49). We lost our Cricket match against Bombay due to a lot of
dropped catches, BeSides Bombay's battmg
was very good But the best news of the
day came from Noore and hiS men (weight
hftlng)
EaSily the qUietest bunch In the
contmgent they strived hard and even starved
to remam In the weight class They deserved
the gold.

Once agam v" and Mathew freaked out to
get the gold and Silver '" the 800M. In
table tennis we beat KGP WIth great ease.
But m football we drew With Bombay. The
rest of the day was free for us to Sit back
and plan our strategy for the crUCial 5th day.

5th day
The day dawned With every member under
tensIon Before the sun set. we would know
whether the general championship was ours
or not Everythmg hinged on the football
match With Deihl. Complicated calculations
made by Kannan showed that victory in
footer would mean we had WOn the G. C,
We began the day well With Chandy and
Klsnen Reddy eaSily winning the gold and
Silver In the Javelin throw. We got the 2nd
place In the 4 x 100M relay. The shock of
the day came In tenniS where we lost to
Bombay. But we avenged our defeat by
beating them In Table-tennis. Then came
the football match we were waiting for.
It
was pretty eVident that the boys were gOing
all out. Billy, Tushar, Rajeev, Rav. Shankar,
Dlwakar, Song and of course the magnifICent
AbhlJlt Blswas rose to the occaSion and put
their heart and soul Into winning the match.
An early goal was disallowed and tempers
were running high. Fortunately another
goal Was soon scored. From then on we
stuck to our lead grimly defending WIth
Blswas bringing off some incredIble saves.
Soon It was all over and we had won, the
match and the G C. The Jubilation and
release from tension was Just too much. We
could now relax. In badminton we beat
DeIhl but In hockey surpriSingly we drew With
Bombay The hockey team has so many
talented players lIke Natarajan, G. S, Kalyan,
KlTo etc. that their lack of form IS astOnish.
mg. In volleyball we were clashing With
Deihl for the gold. We lost the first game
amidst heavy Jeering by the Deihl crowds.
But we fought back ferOCIOusly to Win the
next 3 games and the gold. Hats off to
Moses and hiS men. They were really too
good for the OPPOsitIon. Finally the match
of the day, basketball agam With Deihl. We
were off to an early lead (16-2), the game
was fast-paced and absorbing. But then
Ikes With 4 fouls went out and our play lost
ItS sparkle RaJu was off-colour, so was
Murali Jayaraman was nervous.
Only
Sudhakar was steady. The DeIhl players
egged on by the crowds put on the pressure.
But stili we fought back gamely but lost
narrowly

3rd day

6th dey
We began the day well With Ramallngam
dOing extremely well In the Hammer throw
Kilnnan came 3rd In the triple jump TenniS
was as usual 0$-0 thiS tIme agamst KGP. But
the surprise of the day came In football were
We beat Kanpur ThiS meant we were back
In the reckonmg for a piece Again In hockey
we beat KGP The same team whIch looked
so dISPirited In the prevIous matches now
played sparkling hockey like the champs we
knew thpm to be.
Our basketball match
against KGP was a cakewalk. The first 5
rested and gave the others a chance Ramesh
Tandu) High 8 Ashok played so well that

The only pornt of IOterest was whether
we would WIO the AthletiCS gold. In the
100M which stopped many a heartbeat
Sridhar won the gold With a tlmmg of 11.2
sec
In the 4 x 400M relay thanks to a
superlative effort by v'J, Mathew, Sampat
and Natara)an we won the Silver and clmched the AthletiCS Gold The Prize distribution ceremony followed shortly and we
were proud that We had done It agam.
Months of planning and practice had come
to fru Itlon.
Cont<:!. Overleaf.
