deemed that th,s IS. 10 large part. due to the
Inherent simplicity of the law Itself.

greater appreciatIOn of Edsel Murphy, hIS

To show the ali-pervasIve nature of Murphy's work the author offers a small sample

You hear a duck quacking ... and it's you

You put your Wife out and sleep with

You eat your sanrtary napkin and leave

You complain about the small bathroom

You strike a match and light your nose
You tell ever~one you have to go home
and the party's at your place
You kISS your Wife goodbye and drag your
hostess home

You have to hold on to the floor to keep

Some authorities have held that MurphV's
Law was first expounded by H Cohen when
he stated that' If anything can go wrong It
wllI-dunng the demonstration." However,
Cohen has made It clear that the broader
scope of Murphy's general law obviously
takes precedence.
