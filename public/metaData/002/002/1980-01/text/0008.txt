In the final analysIs what counts IS
not victory or defeat but the participation
Those who didn't perform well this year
could be the stars of next year, The girls
may not have achieved spectacular victories,
but they added 8 lot of color and gaiety to
the proceedings Finally, we wish to commend all the team members, the PTls,
coaches, and the staff members who put m
so much effort for our VictOry.
But we
would like to slOg Ie out two people for
their stupendous effort. One IS of course
our genial Sports Sec Jalram Kamath who
m his qUiet, tactful way solved many a
problem He has Indeed proved to be as
worthy as any of his predecessors. The
other IS none other than our enthUSiastiC,
JOVial Sports Advisor Prof Balaraman. He
not only put 10 a great effort to see
that everythlOg went right. he took a personal mterest 10 all the team members. If
anyone had an Injury or fell III, he would be
the man most womed.
He had set hiS
heart on winning the G C and he made no
bones about It. The rapport he had With the
students should be a model for others
Hence we have no heSitation In nammg both
of them 'Man of the meat.'.
