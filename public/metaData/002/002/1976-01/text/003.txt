If you look through the back issues of Campas-
times you will find the following headlines blazoned
across the front page of the Dec. 69 special issue—

WE DiD IT
WE DID If
WE DID IT

—-— and by the skin of our teeth!

If you’re curious enough to read on, you’ll
discover that we had just about managed to come —
second! The next year we annexed the General
Championship for the first time, in the 1970 meet held
at Madras. Four years and three Meets later the
Championship was still in our grasp, and as the team
left for Kharagpur they had every intention of bring-
ing home the trophy yet again. Well the pundits
were not discomfited and Madras won the Twelfth
Inter-IIT Meet, and if the margin was narrower
than in previous years, the trophy was none the
less ours.

First, the results at a glance;

Now for the gory details -

Ist Day: 18 Dec.

After the opening ceremonies which delayed the
proceedings, quite uncharacteristically it must be
added, the serious business of competition got under

way.

Things began quite symbolically—a mix up in
the 100 m heats and an argument on the tennis courts.
(The inter-IIT Spirit issome kind of ghost which
makes its ephemeral appearance at the victory dinner,
and in the speech of sportsmen seeking to justify the
meet). Madras and Kgp had practised with different
brands of tennis balls, and a dispute arose over which
brand to use. Our captain Prakash suggested the
obvious compromise, but Kgp found it unacceptable
so we finally agreed to play it their way. The draw:
Ravikanth (Mds) vs Khadre (Kgp) ; Kasturi (Mds) vs
Lal (Kgp); Prakash and Raju (Mds) vs Khadre and

Lal. |

Kasturi, otherwise known as Zeenie Baby, and a
rising star on our tennis firmament, romped home
6-2, 6-1. Ravi had some trouble adjusting to the
feel of the balls but took the match 6-3, 6-2. The
match was closer than the final scores would suggest,
Kasturi had finished his match before the first set
was decided. Prakash and Raju then wrapped up
the doubles 6-3, 6-1.

Meanwhile great things were happening on the
track. The gruelling 12} laps of the 5000m race
were in progress. In the previous meet at Delhi
R. Kapoor had beaten the indefatigable Ramalingam
with a fantastic sprint 200m from the tape, and the
Delhi team was confident he would repeat the feat.
At first the race seemed uncannily similar with
Kapoor hard on Ramalingam’s heels, but on the
eleventh lap Ramalingam pulled away with a burst
that left Kapoor floundering in the rear. Ramalin-
gam smashed the record of 17 min 5 secs with an
incredible 16 min 26secs. Dilip and Rajan Dias
came in third and fourth respectively. On the field
Thomas Benjamin hurled the javelin with all his
