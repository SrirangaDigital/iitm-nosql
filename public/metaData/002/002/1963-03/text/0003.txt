CAMPASTIMES

THEY ALL HAPPENED!

It is always presumed that the Courts that
administer justice are rooms where everything
and everybody are serious and where humour

‘Your Honour, I

have a perfect right to describe generally the
paper I am introducing, otherwise the Jury
might think it is a barn door.’
The lawyer appearing for the opposite side

immediately said:

and wit have no place at all. A small yarn,
a short anecdote, an apt jesting, a pithy rejoinder, a little joke, mild fun, a humorous
sally, a witty remark or a brief repartee
breaks the tension of tragedy and seriousness
of the Court and relieves its dull and drab
atmosphere. Here are some examples from
the actual happenings at Courts :

A leading criminal lawyer who was extremely improvident and always shabbily dressed,
on one occasion wore a brand new silk turban
and a new alpaca gown besides the new coat
and a collar and a shining shoe.

meticulous observer as he was, who saw the

The lawyer would not concede either.
‘You remind me of a saying by the same Bacon
that a much—talking Judge is like an ill-tuned
cymbal,’ he said.
‘You are offensive, Sir,’ the Judge cried out.
‘We both are,’ the lawyer said coolly. ‘The
difference is that I’m trying to be and you

At a trial between certain music publishing

was called in as an expert witness. Dwelling
upon ‘musical accent’, the well-known advocate asked the expert witness what it meant.

A Judge had the annoying habit of interrupting the cross-examination of a witness and
putting questions himself. After such a crossexamination of a witness in one case, the
Judge sat back, looking completely satisﬁed
and beamed on the barrister: ‘Mr..... , we
all know what a skilful bridge player you are.

It’s your turn to play the hand now.’
The barrister in his inimitable slow voice
began his arguments thus:

long and unnecessary interruption from the

In a murder case in which a lady doctor
was murdered, a barrister appearing for the
accused was arguing on the ﬁnding of an
aruoal on the sewing machine of the doctor.
He said: ‘I can understand had it been a

stethoscope or a thermometer, but deﬁnitely
not an aruual on the sewing machine, unless

the lady doctor was using it (arrival) for purposes of surgery.’
