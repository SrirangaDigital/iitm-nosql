CA'MPASTIMES

March l5th. I963]

The Second Year proved, beyond doubt,
that they were the best athletes. Their
morale, I must say, is as high as that of the
Jawans guarding our frontiers, and their

ﬁghting spirit is invincible.

their athletic captain, Srikanth, Paul and Nair
did well.

Once upon a time, there was a Sannyasi who
lived deep in the Himalayas (where our Jawans

he isjust recovering from an attack of chicken-

pox, he cleared 9’ 9”.
Finally, I have only this left to Isay:_ Please
aim as high in sports as you aim in your
studies. You may not be very good, but
that hardly matters, for ‘who shoots at the

midday sun though he be. sure he shall never
hit the mark. yet as sure he is, he shall shoot
higher than he who aims at a lush.’
So, Adios Amigos, and best of luck in your

pressive would it have been, if the four
athletic teams, dressed in white, had marched
in separate groups led by their captains!
This, I am sure, could have easrly been
arranged for. It would not only have been
impressive, but would have lent a certain
gravity to the Sports Meet and made it

But during the

night he discovered that rats were coming into
his ashram apparently after the loin cloth. In
order to protect it, the Sannyasi got a cat.
But how was the cat to live P So he got a cow.

maid from a nearby village to look after the

penance and became a Grihastha.

production of 10,000,000 Bachelors of
Technology by I970By Tee Aar
In view of the great need for an increased

out put of ‘ qualiﬁed ’ engineers and technologists, the following scheme for the production

of 10 million B. Tech. graduates is suggested
for consideration and approval by the appro‘
priate bodies. The scheme is based on the
well-known fact that a school year normally
consists of only about 120 working days.

If all holidays and vacations are abolished, a
child entering school at the age of ﬁve can
complete the normal eleven-year course in
about three years and eight months. This
leaves an inconvenient period of four months

to be ﬁlled in, but this may be utilized for
workshop practice before the B.Tech. Course.
The ﬁve-year course can again be ﬁnished
in less than two years, the left-over of four
months being again utilized usefully, say for
General Machines Laboratory Practice. At
eleven years of age, then, you’ll have a

B. Tech. who, in contrast to the existing
ones, has the additional advantage of eight
months of practical experience!

If further

acceleration is required, we can lower the age
of school entry to three thereby saving two

more years and turning out another 3 million
or so graduates. And all this without making
the slightest use of' Huxley’s methods of
