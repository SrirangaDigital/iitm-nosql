Wash basin into the pipe below was closed
with the cork and the water from the tap was
allowed to accumulate. After the basin was
full, the Peon or Sweeper standing by was
pouring the collected water into a jug. This
was how it was done every day, I was

informed.

THE FIRSF ANNUAL
SURVEY CAMP

In an effort to develop a Dairy in the

Campus, a pilot poultry farm has been started
near the hostels. For the present, it is being
used as a play-pen-cum-gymnasium by the
Velacheri kids and E. A. Olia’s group.

The Hanging Gardens of Semiramis are supposed to be one of the Seven Wonders of the

It is, therefore, a

waste of time to sow cigarette and bidi butts

fact that our students are only youngsters who
have hardly outgrown their schoolboyishness,
why not we introduce caning as a punishment

measure will act as an effective deterrent to any
student tempted to take unauthorised leave.

The lorry drivers frequenting the Campus,
seem to suffer from speedomania, or, perhaps,

from the illusion that they own Bonn .and
Delhi Avenue, because their contractors have

constructed them (if constructed is the
proper term). Anyway, they race up and

down the Campus roads whirling up veritable
walls of dust and smoke and giving hardly

anybody else a chance to exist besides them.

editions of Stirling Moss that our roads are

and 3 miles oﬂ‘ Pallavaram from the
Madras~Trichi highway. It is surrounded

by small hills and green ﬁelds as far as the
eyes can scan, dotted here and there by
casurina groves, small lakes and villages.

The camp site was overlooking the temple
and consisted of several tents pitched up
for the students and the members of the
staff.

The Adyar river, very much diﬂ‘erent

from what we see nearby here, provided
water for our daily bath. It was the general
opinion that the students developed the bad
habit of bathing daily. Messing facilities

were arranged with a contractor as none of
our three hostels could help us to set up our
own mess.
The camp work of the students consisted of
series of different surveys eventually from
which a topographical map of the area sur—

veyed was produced. This endeavour took
them over hills and valleys, through terraced
ﬁelds and among villages for a fortnight.
It must be acknowledged that the IVth
year Civil Engineering students spared no
pains during their work to contribute much
to the general success of the Survey Camp.
The highlights of the camp which closed
on the 3rst January, were, the celebration
of the Republic Day on the 26th and a
dinner party on the night of the 29th January. All the members of the camp would
have been very happy if our Director had

found time to visit us at the camp site.
