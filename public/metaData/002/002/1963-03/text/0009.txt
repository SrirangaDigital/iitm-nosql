The second place went

to First Year. Arun Swamy of the First
Year played marvellously. Basically a base-

liner, Swamy has an elegant service and
neat strokes. His well placed drives often
bafﬂe his opponents. A. S. Bawa of Third
Year, despite all his bulk, covered the court

extremely well, gave Arun Swamy a hard
time and beat Kalappa.

Subba Rao Scores Century

The match between the I.I.T. and
Nungambakkam cricket teams ended in a
draw. The match was played at the Nungambakkam grounds on a dead wicket.

Subba Rao made the most of it and scored
a magniﬁcent rot—and that in under 120
minutes. Shetty hit up a valuable 93. He
declared the innings at 279 for 9. The
Nungambakkam XI were 207 for 7 at close

of play. It was Muthukrishnan again who
bowled well for us. He claimed 3 wickets.
