CAMPASTIMES
National (Dis) Integration—(Cont)

few samples of the conversations that I had
with some of the other delegates :—
I. Myself (during a discussion on Dr.
P. V. Cherian’s reference to the lingua franca’
of India) :—‘ You say that Tamil should be

secession, and ‘If 51% of the people want
to secede, they must be allowed to do so’.
I asked ‘You mean 5:34 of the people of
Dravidanad (that is how they insisted I must
call South India) or 51% of Indians P ’.

angry grunt, and sat down. In another group

was,

‘ And what do you do, if you go to the
North ? ’
‘ I needn’t go.’
‘Then how are you going to promote
National Integration ? ’
‘ Needn‘t promote it.’
5. Here’s an extract from a speech made
by the Chairman of the Conference on
National Integration. (Incidentally, he made
it in Tamil) :—
‘If we are to be forced to learn languages
other than our own, there is no necessity for
national integration.’
If all this is not the height of parochialisrn,
then what is it
I thought such mean mindedness and
narrow-mindedness existed onlyamong certain
people in the North.
In fact, even the convmers of the seminar
were not broadminded in their outlook.
Many of the speeches arranged—supposedly
to make us understand National Reconstruction better—advocated separatist principles——
some of them were deliberately delivered in
Tamil for this very reason. I wonder what
would have happened if I.I.T. had sent some
representatives who did not follow Tamil.
I was shocked to find that more than 75%
of the delegates—coming from MA. Economics, History, Politics

and other

classes—-

could not talk a single sentence in English.
All the discussions were mainly carried on
in Tamil. Their knowledge of any subject‘—
including politics and other Arts subjects—
was less than the barest minimum that can
be expected of a student even in a Technical
Institute. To crown it all, they refused to
listen to anything that we had to say, or to
think calmly or reasonably. One of them
was vigorously advocating the principle of

when a similar incident occurred, the member

this meant isolation from the rest of India.
This is practically equiavalent to having a
separate nation.’
Delegate :—‘ In that case, let Tarnilnad be
a separate nation. In fact, if there is a particular language spoken in a particular place, it
should form a separate nation.’
Myself: ‘But there are 648 languages
spoken in India. ’
Delegate: ‘Then let there be 648
nations.’
2. Here‘s an extract from a delegate’s
speech :—
‘ The Gujaratis, Bengalis cm. in Tamilnad are foreigners. If they do not adjust
themselves to the circumstances prevalent
here, they must be kicked out. They can’t
be allowed to spoil the progress of my nation
by forcing us to learn another language .’
At this stage, I interposed, ‘ What do you
mean by “ my nation ” ? ’.
‘Tarnilnad, of course,’ he barked angrily,
and I was too frightened to continue the
discussion any further.
3. One member was vociferously declaring that as no common national language
could be found for the entire nation, the four
Southern States should secede from the North.
When I remarked that it would be equally
difﬁcult to ﬁnd a national language for the
South, and that the other three states may
want to secede again, he freplicd, ‘ We can
prevent that by force.’
‘But it will lead to civil war,’ I protested.
‘ Let it ’, was his answer.
4. One delegate was insisting on having
regional languages alone as the medium of
instruction, and when Iasked him what a
person who migrated from another State to
Madras would do about the education of his

answer.
In fact, the whole attitude of most of the
delegates was one of intolerable arrogance
coupled with absolute ignorance.
I am not, by any chance, trying to condemn South India or South Indians—I am
myself a South Indian. I have lived in the
North for a long time, and I know that such
ﬁssiparous tendencies are even more prevalent'
there. All I am trying to suggest is that it
is high time we put an end to all this and
start working eagerly and sincerely for doing
some reconstructional work. At this juncture, we just cannot afford to waste our
energies in these petty quarrels. We are now
a nation of 400 million people, and are there—
fore respected all over the World—no matter
what our economic and other conditions be.
But do we realise that if we break up into
diﬁerent nations, this respect shall be shat—
tered to pieces, and we shall just become a
pawn in the political game of the Big Powers?
Why is it that all nations give aid to' us
in spite of the fact that we are in no way
aligned to them P—It is because we have a
population of 400 million, and they can never
neglect us when considering their strategy.
They shall certainly not continue to do the
same if we break up into small countries.
Let us not be shortsighted enough to pretend
not to realise the innumerable and unconquerable problems—e.g., the biggest
refugee problem that can ever be created—
that shall spring up as a consequence of the
disintegration of our nation.
It is only in places like the I.I.Ts, Where
people from all parts of the Country meet,
that the seeds of National Integration can be
sown. Let us all rise up to the occasion
and crush the various forces of disunity that
are spreading like an epidemic in all parts of
the Country. It is no use pretending that
the epidemic does not exist at all. It does
exist, and if we are not able to nip it in the
bud, our great, grand, good old nation is
doomed—doomed to misery, chaos and
ultimate destruction, and only the miraclest
of miracles can save it.
UNITED WE STAND, Drvao We FALL.

‘ Chlorination is a celebration of Princes.
It is celebrated when they come to the throne’.
No, not ‘ coronation ’, that’s something diﬂ‘e-

rent. Chlorination is the mat juste alright.
I only have my doubts whether we are justiﬁed
to call a common experience as this a celebration, let alone of princes only, since democracy
has lifted all of us to the lofty heights of
chlorination. But otherwise it’s an undeniable
truth that when we come to certain thrones
we are heavily chlorinated—at least, to judge
from the odours that emanate from those
thrones.
