20th December—III Day
Except for a couple of surprises this was a good day
for mopping-up operations. Found in the mops at the
end of the day—5 golds, 3 silver and 1 bronze.

Something

in everything except footer was the way it worked out.
Badminton :
This was the surprise ; in the ﬁnals against BMB we lost

3-1, Eddie won his singles but Kumar lost both his and
BMB wrapped it up with the doubles. Ullal did a smart bit
of work for BMB.
Tennis :

No problems here.

KNP being thrammed 3-0.

T.T. :

The way Ravi and Parathasarthy fought in the ﬁnals
against KNP was enough in itself to make the whole meet
worthwhile. They had the crowd hoarse when they won 5-2.
Hockey :
The ﬁnals vs DLI was cool. Raghu scored twice and
Chicki once. This hockey team had that little extra which
made all their victories seem kinda inevitable.
Volleyball :
The team which surprised everybody to make it to the
ﬁnals started as underdogs. They fought, well only to go
down 1-3.
