‘ Energy is action and movement
all action and movement;

All thought is energy,
All living is energy,
All life is energy;

Everybody Says there’s an energy crisis ;
That is true. I feel it too.
There is nothing to Say.
You who Say you know—take heed ;'
You know nothing.
There is nothing to say.
ANINMAR.
