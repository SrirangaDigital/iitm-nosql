that people keep asking and wondering about these days. These questions involve matters like the function,

pages or so that appear, more or less periodically, in the campus.

state. One could start from the technical side of the matter knowing that the Institute in kindly muniﬁcence
provides enough of the wherewithal to ensure glossy pages and all the rest. That. however, is an affair which, in
this environment, is an incidental, a frippery useful only to the extent that it may be an encouragement for people
to write. Instead, we have to concentrate on the whys, the whats and the wherefores and try to understand this

the things we do everyday and the course of our lives. The germ of protest, therefore, exists in all _those not

are not many and a magazine is immediately a weapon, and a very powerful one if 'used properly. It may not
accomplish too much,;especially since print can only catalyse and not cause protest (It is here that the shortage of
material, that very thprny affair, can be understood. The lack of good material means only this: that the basrc
energy of protest exists in a rather limited quantity. Such IS the Situation and we are content With it. To include

better purpose). But if only for the purpose of broadcast, print is necessary, the few gropmgs must be enc0uraged
