Well, if I were toothless
you would call me ripe
If I mildly smiled
at each big lie
I’d be the clever one
If I passed lightly over injustice
as you pass over your wives
I would have won your

hearts long, long ago.

Not to be able to call a spade a spade
to quell one’s joy
to swallow pain
to walk the golden middle way

at the extreme edge of the battleﬁeld
to call the swamp sometimes the‘sea, sometimes the
continent
that’s what you call
R e a s on
but don’t you see that your reason
has been borrowed from dwarfs’ brains
from rats’ tails
from creepers’ cracks? You
want to preach Communism to me
but you are the inquisitors of happiness. You
drag souls up onto the ﬁre-stake. You
fasten longing to the rack. You!
'
Get lost, you and you sponge-mugs !
Go away insulted and indignant!
Go, shaking your heads about my wrong attitude
but go!

Ruthless Railing
l
I I I
am full of hatred
full of hardness
my head out to pieces
my brains racked
I don’t want to see anybody!
Keep moving !
Don‘t goggle pop-eyed !
The collective is wrong

4

I will persist in truth
Me the liar

I am the single man
the collective has
isolated
itself from me
Don’t stare at me so knowingly !

5

You are waiting for me with serious certainty
to swim
into the net of self-criticism

I love you
Here take my scribblings
in black and white
I love you ardently
but now please leave me alone
on the wrong path

But I am the pike !
You must butcher me,
_
hack me, pass me through the mincer
if you want me on a sandwich !

separated from the collective
I am wrong
_
I am lying with my wife
and she knows my heart

Oh, I know already
