What does it take to become a lecturer in
IIT? Brains, brawn, or a domineering per-

sonality with the respect-earning leverage of
compuISory attendance, periodical,

terminal

and ﬁnal papers? If Mother Nature didn’t
think it ﬁt to endow you with a surfeit of the
ﬁrst, the last trait will sure come in handy when
face to face with an inquisitive, incredulous and
restless class. An ability to take eﬁective
evasive action (such as blowing your top) when
some rather searching questions are asked is
also recommended. The modus operandi
varies from person to person; but many a
lecturer (with many notable exceptions) obviously unhandicapped by a lack of knowledge,

dishes out what passes for ‘ higher technical

unauaunau

a

education ’ here.
