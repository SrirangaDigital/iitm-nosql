0n the 14th of March Dr. G. Kerkhoii
laid the foundation stone for the Machine
Elements and Materials Handling laboratory.
Dr. Kerkholi represented Bonn in the II
Indo-Gcrman Agreement for technical help
to IIT. The purpose of his present visit is
to get a good and clear idea of everything in
HT, and to have a better understanding of

the project that he is in charge of.
When asked about the feasibility of a 111
Indo-German pact for IIT, he said, ‘ I am
not a prophet.‘ It would depend on the
results of the second agreement.

difference between high and low energy

Some of the scientists felt the difference was
clear from the two adjectives used. High
energy nuclear physiCs dealt with particles
having an energy greater than IO mev. while
low energy physiCS dealt with' energies less
than 10 mev. Others felt that the distinction
is only relative. In the US where very high
energy particle accelerators exist (as high as

33,000 mev.) low energy may be used to refer

cotfee, as one of our staff members presumed.

He was there genuinely interested in knowing
more about his pet subject ‘Solid State
Physics‘.
The perSon in question is, ofcourse. C.
Sivaram (III/5, Mechanical). Sivaram tells
us that he had to spend ‘thc ﬁrst two days
in search of a scientist who could answer his
questions. Still there was nobody at the
seminar working On his branch of interest.
He did manage to have a few informal
discussions on topics ranging from Relativistic Wave Mechanics to Photon-phononelectron in liquid helium.

Such genius in a student of engineering
is, though unusual, commendable; Sivaram
certainly deserves encouragement and help
from the Institute.

Among the scientists moving around, (liscussing and sipping cotice between SeSsions
of the Physics Seminar, you must have
noticed a slightly built bespectacled individual
in the group, asking questions. No, he was
not there because of an over-enthusiasm for

to particles of energies greater than to mev.
Basically low energy nuclear physics deals with
interactions between elementary particles of a
comparatively low energy.

The weak interactions are to12 times weaker
than electromagnetic
interactions. They
occur in various types of beta decay (or electron
decay) in cosmic particles and radio active
disintegrations. The gravitational force or
interaction is to18 times weaker than the socalled weak force. It is hence easily observed
only in very large bodies.
One of your correspondents pointed out
that all these four interactions are responsible
for generating the heat and light of the sun.
In agreement one of the delegates added that
they do but in a cyclic order.
The delegates representing solid state
physiCS emphasised the close connection between solid state physics and electronic engineering. Outstanding research carried out in
solid state physics has often revolutionized
the electronics industry (e.g. _the transistor
and the tunnel diode).

The scientists told us how the nucleus is
not just a simple sphere as it was thought to
be. Many nuclei especially the unstable ones
are elongated spheroids having complex
shapes. As for the nature of nuclear interaetions we were told that all particles in the
universe basically follow four types of mutual
interactions: strong, electromagnetic, weak
and gravitational. The strong interactions
are IO-IOO times stronger than the electromagnetic interactions between charged particles.
They account for the large binding energy of
the various particles within the atomic
nucleus. It is this binding energy stored in
the particles by the strong interactions between
them that is released in the explosion of the
atom bomb. The electromagnetic interactions
of course account for the electron nuclei combination within the atom. It is this force
which causes the electrons to move round the
nucleus in planetary orbits.
In India several institutes work on solid

state physics notably the Institute at Trombay and the Tata Institute of Fundamental
Research at Bombay. They Work in close
collaboration with the electronica and atomic
reactor industries. Their work ranges from
integrated circuits to manufacture of ferrite
materials for use in computers. Solid State
Physics also has important application in
modiﬁcation of conventional metallurgical

processes for manufacturing alloys of greater
strength.
One of the Conveners told Campmlim
that this Seminar is held annually at diﬁerent
centres.

The

success of the

Seminar,

he

feels, cannot be judged right now. ‘ Only
after the scientists are able to gain through
the exchange of ideas at the Seminar and
are aided by this in their future work can
we say that the Seminar has been successful
at least to a certain extent ’ he explained.
