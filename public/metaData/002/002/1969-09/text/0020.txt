GAURlSANICAR

The way the elections for the posts of classrepresentatives of various years were conducted recently, reminds. me of the.,.Indian
political s::ene. There was intense canvassing
by' the contestants, and some catc~y slogans
decorated every wall in H.S.B.· 'and other
places. What amused me more was the conveyance facilities provided to the voters to·
exercise their franchise at C.L.T., Oll[ polling
booth. They used cars, mobikes and bikes.
I happened to overhear someone .say: Look
yar! This guy goes on that guy's mobike but
votes for some other guy'. Even at the
hostel level, I heard, there are some guys who
preferred heavy 'treats' to empty promises
in making their decision. This, perhaps,
explains the reason why the results are not as
expected in some cases.

One feels highly delighted to find that
Sarayu hostel gets the full status of a hostel
from this year onwards with four, Gymkhana
representatives. Recently this had given an
opportunity to various ~ontestants of individual committees seeking election to thfh
Gym!thllO:l. as secretaries to make occasional
trips to this hostel, which under normal
Circumstances would not have been possible,
and convince them of their abilities. Judging
.from the total strength of the hostel, One gets
the feeling that almost all of this hostel
hold some portfoI.io or other either at hostel
or Gymkhaoa level. Let us hope that their
presence will at least add some colour and
charm to the Gymkhana if not highlightcn its
activities with some bright new ideas.

A word about film-club cards. Its present
sil(;e, with the look of a ' ration-card ' does not
suit any purse or pocket of normal size.
Besides One wonders if the monthly renewals
of these cards for those coming from hostels
is really necessary. Last year's weather-proof
design .seems to be a better idea. By introducing this card system, the film cIu b might
have succeeded in preventing the Velacheri
crowd from, entering the G.A.T •.But•. the.
committee has totany overlooked another
important aspect. This is the only theatre in
the city where kids have free access to adult
movies.
