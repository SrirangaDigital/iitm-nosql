Reopening day. AU faces, eager and expec~
tant, are turned towards the classroom door.
In strides the lecturer. looking around like a
gladiator as he walks up to the platform. He
draws out from his file the attendance register
and calls out, one, two.......... • We
don't know the new serial numbers, Sir,' pro~
tests a voice from the back benches. Suspi~
<:ion on the lecturer's face.
• All right, since this is the first day, I will
call you names.'

An explosion, a sudden burst of laughter,
which dies off just as suddenly, as the learned
man glares at you and demands' What is the
matter? '. Silence reigns; for you know that
if he understands what the matter is, there is
an overwhelming possibility of his making
good his promise of calling·you names.
You and I know he has slipped. Now, what
exactly is a slip? This is what the dictionary
tells you, .••. slip (n): A sliding of the feet;
a leash; a long strip of printed matter; an
inclined plane upon which a ship is built; 'an
unintentional error; .•. and so forth. Let us
skip over (or rather slip under) aU the other
meanings and take the last. So the slip, for
our purpose, is an unintentional error, creeping in as it does on all CQnceivable occasions
to the delight of many and:the chagrin of One.
Now, how could the error possibly occur?
It could be an apparent jugglery with words
and phrases: a lack of synchronisation of the
brain and the tongue. This, as you know, im~
parts to your words a meaning unforeseen, in
many cases comic. In' The Prince and the
Pauper' one reads of • baronets with hats on
their lieads of crimson velvet '. Who knows,
probably there may be such beings, far out
there in space.
Spelling, in the English language, is e1/eryone's bete noire. A hazy idea of spelling in
many cases spoils your intentions of conveying your ideas. When I declare in all earnestness that Earnest Hemingway wrote ' The Old
Man and the Sea' or that Fiddle Castro rules
over Cuba, well, pardon me for I am just fiddling with the spelling. But could you pardon, even with all possible sympathy, our
library which politely reminded a person last
year that he had not returned even after reminders, the book, • Explosion of Science:
The Physical Universe' by Sir Bernard
Lover I
Another category of slip' appears when one
interchanges letters or sounds in a word.
This is the celebrated 'spoonerism' which
according to the encyclopaedia is 'a transpo~
sition, accidental or otherwise, of initial letters
or syllables of two or more words'. (incidentally, it is held that many of those attributed to. the Rev. Spooner are actually due to
J. Huxley; • On Living in a Revolution')
This is the one you indulge in when YOli ' hiss
the mystery classes'. What is more, if the slip
is due to a lisp of the tongue, you could as
well boa~t that you were. making a deliberate

Alright Olympian, you're too big to bother yourself with the affairs of mere

Something that might enable you to justify the bloated opinion YOli have of your sense

attempt at spoonerism. Now, how would a
slip be like when ther~ is a s~~erposition of
spoonerism on a false JuxtaposItIon of words;
an effect where one reinforces the other? It
would be colossal-just imagine how an
Englishman w?uld look, with a howler bat 011
his head of Crimson velvet.
For all the apparent simplicity of classification of slip, it may perhaps be well nigh
impossible, sometimes, to say jf an error was
• just a slip' or an unpardonable mistake. If
you or I say' Socrates won undying immortality' it is an unpardonable mistake. But
when a professor, say of History or English,
utters these words it is just a slip; for professors, as you know, are notoriously absent~
minded. So the demarcation between the
two seems to be thin j the distinction, subtle.
The fact that a slip is unintentional does
not discount the possibility of a hazardous
reprisal; !or the story goes t,hat 1I. p.~wly recruited sador responded to hIS captam s order~
with a 'yaa, Boss', and then apologised• sorry sir, I slipped' . C All right', snapped
the worthy officer, ' but next time you slip, I
slap~understand ? '
Watching another person slip can be fun,
either in the literary sense or in the physical.
But think of your own plight. if in pointing
out the slip, you yourself said.
, Pardon, your ship is slowing ! ;

SHORT STORY

SAM ·AND CATHY
They were made for· each other. They
didn't win the Wilts contest;· but if they had,
they might have prevented the eventual
winners from seeing the· beauties of
Kashmir.
Sam and Cathy met for the first time in
the park. The moment they saw each other
they knew it. Then followed the usual
things that happen vt.hen the young at heart
fall in love at first sight. Had it been an
Indian movie, we might have seen two ducks
in the lake, two flowers being blown towards
each other by the wind etc.
The lovers did not believe in the usual
conventions of society. They began to live
together. Cathy was very feminine and like
most females, she would never let Sam out of
her sight after office hours. They would go
for long walks in the evenings or watch
television at home. She was devoted to him
and never left his bedside when Sam fell sick.
Saln WaS also faithful to Cathy. His relations with his secretary became business like;
He left his bachelor friends. Sam was missed
in the club. His friend Dicky tried to talk
Sam off his· infatuation, but Sam just wouldn't listen. So Dick got annoyed and said,
, You're crazy to give up your social life just
for that bitch.' Dick only succeeded in getting his jaw broken,
Sam entertained his friends at home occa~
sionally. Cathy would meet the guests at the
door, .but she never took part in the conversatlOn. She kept an eye on Sam to see
that he didn't get into mischief. But when
she felt that it was time for the guests to go
home, she did not mince words. She would
start howling, which was about all she could
do since she was a ... er • •• • she-dog.
