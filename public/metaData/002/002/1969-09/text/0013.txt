About the Tendency lor
Campastimes to Expand Itself

BROCHURE
Sir,
Last year, as almost everyone in the Insti~
tute knows sweeping changes were made
in the st;ucture of Gymkhana publications. In brief, Campastitnes would publish
4 issues annually, the Institute Magazine
would be scrapped and replaced by a
Gymkiza1Ja Brochure. All this was done
amidst a lot of fanfare in a speech made on
Institute Day and in individual pr~testations
made by Gymkhana chiefs to students.
Well, the Brochure has been received ,b:y
most of us; quite frankly, I was lookmg
forward to going through it. Unfortunately,
the only point in its favour seems to be the
excellent pL"inting and the clear photographs,
Apart from this. the Brochlll'(J is!1 rehash, of
old Campastimes n~ws', and ~ontams ~othmg.
original at all. It IS dlsgustmg to be mformed under the heading 'Cultural Events',
about programmes held four or five . years
ago: I am referring to the parts r~latlng to
items like' Playtime USA', the Indiana Jazz
Ensemble. etc.
In short, Sir, this issue of the Gymkha1za
Brochllre sticks in the Craw of any self·res~
pecting IlTian. It is my very sincere hope
that this year's Brochure will ~ot be an
imitation of the first, not-so-grand Issue,

Dear Editor,
Once upon a time, there lived a Cute little
Campastimes.
.
It had only one editor and there were a few
guys helping him to ~ring it. out. And, they
did a fairly decent Job of It because It was
the only Campastimes they had and they liked
it very much.
And then came a whole lot of big bad staff
members who grabbed the poor little mag
by its tail and in5i~ted on tying al.1 sorts ?f
nasty old tins and fireworks and thmgs to It.
And they set fire to it and merrily watched it
run around suffering.
But things don't happen like that in fairy
tales. A good fairy godmothel' came al<?ng
and sent all the wicked people away. I thmk
she turned them into frogs-that's why lIT
has so many I
Unfortunately, lots of other people came
along: little people with big ideas. At first
they did a decent job of running the mag.
Later they had to give up. They had to go
and ask the wise Old Wizard for help.
He was smart. He brought in his own
ideas and blokes and things went on nicely
for a while.
For awhile •••••••.•
Then other blokes came along. They
wanted posts and high sounding names for
themselves. They got them.
You have the Keeper of the Exalted Inkpot,
the Painter of the Rebounding Big Toe, the
Grand Dragon Guarding the Chickenface
Block ••••••• ,
That's why Campastimcs isn't cute or little
anymore.

Dear Mr Editor,

stooped so low as to reveal this childish
attitude in public, and that too, b~fore the
eminent citizens of OUr society r Be it known
that the cream of the country m~st beha,:e

holiday is de~lared after the convo~atlOn e,;ery

Let this be a reminder to control our
emotions on such occasions in future.
