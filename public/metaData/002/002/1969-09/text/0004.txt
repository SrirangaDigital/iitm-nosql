Two morons, Saxy aqd,PaJ):Ylwere, de\?perately I,nJ~gg~?g
fQr the next day's exam. " They, had, been at it.for1the past
two ',hours, and they, were getting, Jjlore ,and mare frantic
with every ,passing l,llinute:, , Suddenly,,·Saxy 'got up 'and
threw the, ,b90k h~ w,as ..t!!ading Qut' of the windo·w. .:' I
give up,' he's~id, 'it ''is impossibleJ, I'd sell lPY Xv-ery
soul to the Devil if I could only get tomorrow's question
paper.'
. At this moment the Devil \valked into the room. At
first the guys did not ~ecognize 'him as' such due to his
remarkable resemblance to the Assistant'Warden 6f Saxy's
hostel. But on' closer ~xa~ination; his horns, hooves,
and forked tail proclaimed 'that he w~ none other than·
the Devil himself and no cheap iihitation.
, Did I 'hear you. say you'd .trade sour saul for tomorrow's question ,paper? ': eagerly inquired the Dev~I.
Saxy looked as ifhe. want~d to .back out, but the ~ sight 'of
the question p~per . in' the;Devil's' lefi., hand goaded ,him
~ni:o signing ,his naihe
thl'; .doc,ument, that the Devil had
prod,uced from ~i~ .b.riefca~e.· .. The' peviJ gave, him the
QP and haying, ~lobbered over' the document for a few:
minutes. disappeared.

Time passed; both' Saxy and Paxy croaked. 'Saxy:of
course' went to Hell, but Paxy, d~e to s!Jme misprillt on the
list, was sent to, Heaven in the' place of some goody~
goody.
~ we~k )ater,.. Saxy met Paxy ~il'2:h'infernal restaurant.
·Tp.~y got to y'a~ing aQout old:: times. over a bqtt~e. of
castor oil. , Saxy ,asked Paxy h,o¥,'he was faring in ~eaven.
Paxy:sigl;l.ed, aha said;, 'Heaviirl. is it rotten place •.' The
troll;ble is, '~y.e.ryb,9cli;~~pects, y~u"::!D', behave ~~e.,ll;~.~aint~

Yqu ,have to work ve~y' ha.rd'· ~~ bl?ing good, otherwise
you're done'for. How are, you,'getting on in.Hell any~
way?'
'Excellently,' repli,ed $axy. 'The, grub is far better
,than hostel grub. The temperature is lower than it useg
to be in Madras, aml:.due to· the large number of people"
that has been entering Helllately•. ,unemploym~nt is rife.
We in Hell hard1y~ever wo!k. ,Hell)s the Utopia.! used'
to dream about whiI~ I was in lIT! '
The moral of the story is: GO TO HELL I

If he has both, there' 'ls no defence.

(2) East must 'have at least the Ace of Hearts for the contract to be beaten.
Then if this round is 'ducked, South will be forced to finesse the Jack of. Spades,. through

On the other hand, suppose W(lst wins the round and knacks out South's, King even though

the winning play would be to duck the second rouna/in spite'ofknowing

that East cannot have
another ent~y." Then declarer is bound to finesse the Jack of Spades wrongly---in the hope
that even if it lost, '''Hearts would not be cashed immediately.
