WHAT a remarkable ten"year period this has been, witnessing the rapid growth of this institution of
learning and its township. How call we forget that the location of this higller Institute for technological study in the Southern Region at Madras was entirely due to your able advoCc1cy of the claims
Of this metropolitan city for this privilege? The acquisition of this extensive sylvan paradise for housing it was possible because of your imagination and vision and unremitting efforts. We have been the
beneficiaries, over the years, of your deep and abiding interest in the creation. of a modern and purposeful township with all the basic amenities for the academic community of staff-members and students
living in it. We are justly proud that, in lay-out and environment, our Institute commands a preeminent position among its sister institutions in the country.

NoR can it

be othelwise, considering the rich ex.perience that you possess as an administra.tor and
educationist. To you again, we owe the excellent academic standards that we have attained.
With rare intellectual detachment, you brought to the task of building up this Institute a band of teachers
and research workers, persons who have distinguished themselves by their scholarly work and devotion
to duty. You laid a secure base for training students in a multitude of disciplines in science and techllology, and successive batches of students have gone out to :fin positions in the country's nation-building
activities in educational, administrative and industrial spheres and they have reflected credit on th.e
Alma Mater. Your guiding; hand as Chainnan of the Board of GoveOlors for three consecutive terms
has stabilised the Institute and endowed it with the strength and respect that it enjoys. The Institute
as a whole benefitted by your zealous guardianship of the autonomy of educational institutions. The
leadership and counselling providing by you have been mainly responsible for the accelerated development of the Institute under the German Technical Assistance Programme and the emergence of this
Institute as a shining symbol of fruitful international collaboration in the field of technical education.

SIR, India can be proud of you; you have earned distinction for our country

by your remarkable
achievements in various fields. Your fame in the field of medicine has been equalled only by
your reputation as the Vice-ChanceUor of the Madras University which office you held with honour for
over 25 years-a record of service unique in the annals of University Education anywhere in th6 world.

THE achievements that stand to your credit are too numerous to be catalogued. Only a few may
be mentioned-your monumental work for the University of Madras, your con.tribution as a
Member of the University Grants Commission, your services to the World Health Organization and to
the Councils of the UNESCO. your Chairmanship of the Regional Committee of the All India Council
for Technical Education and your role as elected Member of the Legislative Coullcil. One wonders
how so much could be crowded into the active years of the )ife of a single man. Yet we know the
answer. You possess the moral qualities which cOlltribute to true greatness, high sense of duty, firm~
ness of conviction. patience and, above all, freedom from motives of selfish advantage. We always
see you, in our mind's eye, as a figure of rock~like strength and integrity, imb"fled with commonsense

and 'wisdom.

SIR,

you possess traits af character which are only rarely found in combination in the same individual
-culture and urbanity, tact and wisdom, a respect for tradition and a progressive outlookqualities which mark out the great man in a crowd of average mortals. Withal, you have a generous
heart, always ready to understand the difficulties of teachers and students, and eager to fil1d a solution
for them. We were specially privileged to be under your fostering care during the formative years of
the Institute and we basked in the sUll-shine of your radiant personality.

MEN with such phenomenal abilities and qualities of character, emerge, if at all, once in. a generation.
You have shaped us into what we now are. This Institute, your last and may we say, your best
crea~ion, will cherish memories of your association with it with pride and gratitude. You have left us
to enjoy a well-earned rest after well nigh half-a~century of unremitting labours in the cause of higher
education. It is our firm. hope that you will continue your abiding interest ill us and give us the benefit
of your mature counsel whenever we need it.

WE pray to the Almighty, the Dispenser of all favours, to bless you with many more years (jf peace
and happiness and the strength to continue to serve noble causes and to promote worthy efforts.
