The primeval night had descended upon
IIT. A cool breeze wafted across the-roads
.and left in its wake a tranquil peace. There
could be seen in the distance a dim light
penetrating the dark shroud of the night.
The IITian hostelwards plodded his weary
way after seeing ajlick at Velacheri. As the
figure approached nearer, one could see gloom
and despair showing on the face lit by the
feeble glow of the Charminar. One could
divine intuitively an unfathomable sorrow
sitting heavily on his shoulders. He approached his hostel and found the gates of that
haYen barred to him. The Warden had
issued strict orders that all the freshers

should be back by nine o'clock. This was
issued along with the other five commandments, the chief of which were:
• Thou shalt write home regularly,
Thou shalt like the hostel grub,
Thou shalt n~t be ragged under any circumstances . • •
This was just a minor thunderbolt compared to what he had already sustained. 'Bullets
don't harm a dead person, do they?' he
asked himself. His mirthless laughter echoed
and re-echoed ill his brain, until the practicaL
side of him woke up and nudged him with a
• Now what?' He came to his senses and
made a bee-line for the side wall. He climbed

with leaden feet, aU the time thinking about
his woe-begotten fate. A sudden slip and he
came hurtling down. The ground came rush~
ing up to meet him, and what a meeting it
was I The meeting of two long-lost brothers
would hardly have been more intimate. His
inel·t, prostate form lay on the turf. C 0
Lucifer, Son of the Morning, how art thou
fallen ?' were the words that sprang to one's
lips.

We must go baCk to ye oide days jf we are
to discover the cap-5e of Chandran's woe and
his consequent fall. It was the age-old coin~
plaint Adam suffered from, the complaint for
which Mr X has removed his beard and Mr
Y has grown one: in short. love. He was
madly in love with Geetha ; so much so that
he never borrowed the same pair of trousers
twice when he- was to appear before her divine
presence. Many were the days Chandran
spent around Sacayu, and many were the
days Geetha felt her own shadow superfluous.
Resourceful Chandran managed a introduction
to her in his own unique way. One day
while he 'was walking back to the hostel after
a particularly boring class and she was walking
along the wetI-worn path to Sarayu, she dropped her handkerchief. A tornado detatched itself
from the neighbourhood and chnrg~d straight
at the handkerchief. Even a critical rhino~
ceros would have been all praise for Chandran. Geetha thought she was seeing pink
elephants. One of course understands and
sympathises with her. The pink cloud on
which Chandran was floating combined with
his obese form, must have created such an
effect.
Aslyway, having come down on the handker-chief like a wolf on the fold, he retrieved it
and handed it back, aU the time imagining
the sweet words she WQuid utter in thanks
and the tears of gratitude welling in her
eyes. • ••• When he looked up, she just
wasn't there. He stared open-mouthed at her
receding form like a fish with lockjaw.
