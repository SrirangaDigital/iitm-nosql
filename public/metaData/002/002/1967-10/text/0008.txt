CAMPASTIMES

Solutions to last
month's Puzzles
There are seven bus routes and seven
stations.
a. There was an unfortunate mistake in
the phrasing of the problem. The problem
as it reads, is too simple. Sundararama~
should choose Batra-Subba-Batra. The
correct requirement for the prize is that
Sundararaman must win at least two successive
matches in the three-match series. In this
case Subba-Batra-Subba is preferable to
Da!ra-Su~ba-Batra although it means playing
tWIce agalDst the better player.
Let • a' be the probability of defeating
Suhba Rao and ' b' that of defeating Batra.
Now if S-B-S is chosen the prize is won if
and only if the series has one of the following
outcomes: (x) Win all three matches (a)
Win the first two and lose the third, and (3)
Lose the first and win the next two matches.
The probability of (I) is axbxa; that of (a)·
is a X b X (I -a); and that of (3) is (I-a)x b Xa.
These three outcomes are mutually exclusive'
that is, no single series can have more th~
one of these outcomes. So we add the three
probabilities to get the probability of winning
the prize. This turns out to be zab-a2 b or
ab(z-a). Similar reasoning gives the proba:'
bility of winning the prize if B-S-B is chosen
as aab-ab 2 or ab (a-b). Now. as b is
greater than a. (a- b) is smaller than (2 - a)
and so ab (2-a) is greater than ab(a-b).

[ October. 1967

If spades (or hearts) are trumps the declarer plays two rounds of hearts (or spades).
North ruffs the third round and the club
finesse is taken. Now the trumps are drawn
and South makes the remaining tricks.
If diamonds are trumps. two rounds of
trumps are followed by three rounds of
spades, North ruffing the third round. Two
more rounds are played followed by a club
finesse. South's hand makes the remaining
tricks.
If clubs are trumps, three rounds of spades,.
or hearts are played, North cuffing the third
round. The club finesse is taken and trumps
are drawn. South makes the remaining tricks.

A book on mathematics has mentioned
that the problem can be solved in two diffe~
rent ways. But the book did not give any
solution and the writer is not aware of second
solution. If any reader has found it he is
requested to send the solution to Campastimes.
The same book mentioned that a deal has
been constrilcted in which N-S cannot even
make a small slam in No Trumps while a
grand slam is possible in any suit. Surely,
some. of our bridge maniacs will solve the
problem and' send the solution to Campas
tlmes.

CRYPTARITHMS
. I wonder how many have heard of crypta
nthms although many of us must have tried
them some time or other. These are puzzles
which operate by substituting letters, dots or
asterisks for numbers. Each letter stands for
a particular digit while· a dot or as asterisk
mar stand for any digit. It is a popular
bellef that these are solved by inspiration
alone. Let me assure you there is no truth
in it. To achieve proficiency in this it is
essential that you proceed logically using all
the properties of numbers that you know.
Let us take an example and see how it is
solved. It is a multiplication by the method
of partial products.

First we note that in the second partial productDxA=D. Theref<;lreA=1. Thenboth
C X E and C X D end in C. This means that
(i) e is equal to zero
(ii) C is equal to 2, 4 or 8 while D and E
are I and 6.
or (iii) e is.;equal to 5 while D and E are
both odd.
I
(i) is not possible as in the addition of the
two partial products, E+ C ends in B different from E. (ii) Is not possible as neither D
nor E can be 1. If either of them were I the
corresponding partial product would be ABC
itself and this is not the case. So e is S. D
and E are both odd, 3. 7 or 9.
Now we see that ExBC==ExBS ends in
ES.. So, if E is 3, B must be 4; if E is 7. B is
2 ; 1f E 1S 9. B is 5. The third case is not
admis.sible as e is already S. Now D X BC
ends in Ee. If E is 3. B is 4 and D is 7 or
9. But neither of these two values satisfy
this condition. So we are left with E=7 and
B==2. D turns out to be 3.
Now it only remains to complete the multiplication to o9tain
l!Z5X 37=4625.
Here are a few simple ones:
(1) TWOx,TWO=THREE
(2) SEND+MORE=MONEY
(3)
ALE

RUM

WUL

ERMPNE
In each case the aim should be not only to
get the solution but, more important, to
prove its uniqueness.
