You have no problem. (Incidentally, you
remind me of my days in lIT). Take
chappatis at night. Tbey contain abrasives
which clea~ y;'~pr teeth adequately, They are
made specially to massage your gums. More·
over the mess dhals -contain Ger11Zosttlzk-X
which kills germs instantaneously. (An
excess dose will kill you too).

• Cousin Kickloo is a descendant of Aunt Emma who
answered your queries in a previous issue.

It is abeT 1Iat1lralich that' ,a shrewd man
knows the ~ns and outs of ,many things;
shrewdness IS a by·product of experienceAnd a person who has not been mischievous
in his student day. 01' hasn't got into certain
situations, or who bas led a sedate existence-'
cannot understand and anticipate student be~
haviour. The fact that Prof.,P. C. Varghese
(popularly called Papa by all IITians).knows
the mind of the students, proves that he' has
b~en thro' this baptism. of heI~ 'and tire during
hiS college-days. HIS ever so charming,
butter.couldn't·melt-in·your~mouthJ cherubicsmile fools nobody. He claims to have been
an exemplary student:""but we know othel'Wise.
"Papa has had a brilliant career and has
kept oscillating between research and the
practical side of his branch of Civil Engineer
ing. He took his B.Sc. at Loyola (thereby
accou!,l?n:g fot: the, present Loyola Principal's
,hpstile" 'attitude towards lIT) •. He graduated
from .the.,Ttivandrum Engineering College,
in Civil Engineering, with a gold medal
(equivalent of our President's Medal) and
joined the PWD pefore proceeding to Harvard
for his MS. 'He is mighty tight~1ipped ahout
his,e~ploits thl;1,'e (after all Radcliffe was not
N

very far off I)-but he says that the American
student is more serious about everything.
Papa was- among the first few to get a
doctorate', a~ the. 'lIT) Kharagput where he
worked later as, Superintending Engineer.
'He joined the. 111', Madras at an early stage
in its"development and has been the Head of
Department,,?f: Civil Engineering for quite a
few years now.
A man is most appreciated in retrospect.
The ,Gymkhana thrived under his control.
(He' was president between the years 1964
arid 1967.) Though many decisions he took
were ?-lot to the liking of some, they proved
to be beneficial to the Gymkhana. He Vla&
responsible for starting the Social Welfare
Committee and to a large extent (baited by
Mani a~d Amir) for the 35 mm. projecto::.
At College, Papa was the student~secretary
and organised quite a few strikes-' bikyaws
strikes were a way of showing our' nationalistic
tendencies.' His love for nuts (cashew nuts)
arises out of having lived near Quilon, the
heart of the nut in~ustry.

(As we go to pres;], we hear that Dr. Varghese
has been appointed Chairman oj the Admissilms
Committee for the year 1968-69.-Ed.)
