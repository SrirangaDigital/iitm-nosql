CAMPASTIMES

o
The apathy on the part of the students In
theIr own affaiis IS caused partly by wh'lt I
would like to refer to as the commul1lcatlOn
gap. The students should know what theIr
representatives afe dOing. In this I:oiumn I
would like to dISCUSS, narrate and communIcate with those whom I am representmg
Bemg the student member of the Transport
Comnllttee I attended the meetlOg held a few
weeks back. My plea to revive the old bus
tlmlng was rejected, because, I was told,
enough buses were not avaIlable. The Institute
has four buses only two of whIch are 111 nmnmg condltlon. One non-operatiOnal bus IS
constantly under repaIr wlllie the other IS
under preparatIOn for the FItness Certlficate.
It takes the Auto shop about fout or five
months to get a bus ready for FItness Certificate. Also because of speed-breakers each
bus tnp takes five minutes longer The nse
of mmlmum fare has been necessItated because
of audIt problems. The request for free ride
to the classes by the students was turned
down. In my View student representatIOn 1n
tillS commlttee should be I(lcreased as bus
servIce IS fundamentally a student amenity.
The FIlm club commIttee has been reconstituted under the Presldentshlp of Dr.
N. V. C. Swamy of the FlUId MechanIcs
Department. Student Ex-offielD members
bemg the General Secretary and the EntertaInment Secretary. On the recommendatlon of
the said members Raja was made the student
FIlm Secretary for the year ConsIdering the
fact that movIes are the only form of entertamment 10 the Campus It would be good to show
an English mOVie before every hohday.
Student membershIp of the student AId
Fund CommIttee has been mcreased from
two to four. Over a hundred thousand has
been collected m the past few years and mnety
four thousand has been dJsbursed to the
students. There IS very httle purpose served
u thIS loan cannot be collected back Instances
where the students even when they were III a
position to pay back have not done so have
been observed. But efforts are bemg taken to
gear up matters.
The defaulting students who do not pay
back thiS loan should be sued only then can
we make thIS fund self-sustammg. Students
have been mcluded m the sub commIttee to
scruumse deservmg cases.
PrepartlOns are on for holdmg the carmval
in February on a grand scale. Co-operation
of all students to make the carmval a success
finanCially and otherWise, IS vItal.
There IS a great need to have feedback from
students m the academIc field An incompetent and unfit student IS castIgated by an
extension of courses. A staff member with
the same faults IS not even so much as told to
improve or correct himself. The students
should at the end of the semester evaluate
the course and the teacher so that the faculty
members can know where they stand In the
eyes of students Some staff members (usually
the good teachers) get students' OplnIOn at the
end of the courst'. Next semester It IS proposed to conduct an opinIOn poll. ThIS IS
only meant to serve the purpose of Improvement of teachtng and not to JU t grade the
teachers. In Kanpur I.I.T. and Ahamedabad
as welI as other progreSSIve mStitutions thiS
system IS bemg followed. The Gymkhana
CounCil has approved of the staff evalu~t1on
on prmclple.
WhIle we are at It, III my Vlew the periodIcal papers should not be cOTnct"d by the
staff member who teachcs the subJc\.,t as
personal prejudIces etc. come Into play A
Btudent who IS not regular In class falls m
~eachers eyes even though hiS puformance
In pertodlcals may be as good as any on" ds,,'s.
That there I" nl) prejudIce m gradmg IS a
myth that mlslcads no ,tudent
The D"puty DIrector feds that I voclftrolUly proclaim the eXistence of bureautracy
when there IS no such thing In r IT Illbt
!O substantiate my charge I WIll narrdt\" J few
Instances. For about 2 months con~tant
attempts were made to get an Art Room for

0

o

the Atts Club. A sanctIOn from Duector before he Icft for U.S. was got long back but
no room was secured. FInally a room was
allotted 10 N C C bUilding, a date waS fixed
to VISit It a week, hence when the Fmc Art
Secretary, the Gymkhana Pre~ldent and
Deputy DIrector VISIted the N C.C. block.
They were astonIshed to find them well
furmshed but locked and keys mlsslOg.
Later It was found that the keys were
handed over to an offiCial of the Government
of IndIa. The offiCIal machinery has been
set to retneve the key but It IS unltkely
that the Art Club WIll statt thiS semester
Anyway the Deputy DIrector IS leavtng no
avenue unexplored to get the room.
The ether day the student commIttee members wanted to screen a mOVle. The next day
bemg hohday It was felt that as per traditIOn
a movie should be screened. A movie was
avaIlable, projector available, operator available, audIence eager to see a movie and only
permISSIOn was to be got. The Deputy
Drrector, though, he assured us, he would
love to see the mOYle, could not grant permISSIon because the FIlm CommIttee had
to decade, the CommIttee could not meet
because PreSident was out of statIOn. The
students \\ho ran around hoptng for permIssion
were merely frustrated.
Concluding, a note on our Ambulance Van.
I was gIVen the ImpreSSion that ambulance van
was there to see that urgent cases were
brought under medIcal care WIth the least
wastage of time. On heanng, thd.t an IlTlan
was mvolved 10 an accIdent during the mterhostel entertamment, I ~sked to go In the
ambulance to render any aSSistance It pOSSIble.
It took some tIme to get the dnver, log book,
and all other paper work completed
Then
when It came to gomg the ambu1ance van
refllsed to start. Fmally, I had to take
alternate conveyance. If thIS IS the way we
are gOIng to mamtalll our ambulance It IS
bettel not to have an ambulance van at all.
ThiS IS not to Imply that we are at loggerheads WIth anybody. You and I know that
the Deputy Director and the rest are as much
mterested In us as Qn)<body else. But qUIte
often ImpedIments make the Job of a Secretary
qUIte dejfu;ult.
I don't mean there are
Impediments everywhere. But I pomt out
the objects becaUSe the pleasure we get out
the Campus life are the pQSltlve aspects of
the Gymkhana.

Whcn I came to know that the MusIC Club
IlT, Madras 36 (helClnafter referred to a~
'the Club ') was g01l1g to celebrate ItS first
anniversary, I wondered as to \\hat went
wrong With the Club. Very soon I could
consoli, myself saymg
• perhaps nobody
could help It'. However, I do not know
whether Sn S. Y. Knshnaswamy, who
maugurated the Club a year ago and who IS
aware of the way In whIch MUSIC Sabhas In
the CIty are maugurated and their fate a
little later, was ever prepared for such an
attack ot news.
Anyway, one cannot forget the unpact the
KathyaYlnl Sangeetha Sabha (helclOafter
referred to as 'the Sabha') \\hlch once eXIsted
In thiS Jungle cIty left behmd. The S.lbha
was so noted far ItS unostentatious outlook
that It conSIdered celebration of the first
anniVersary unnecessary. Havlllg taken such
a Ius tune deCISIon, the Sabha must have
senously pondered over the best way to

,lvold the celebration. And they achieved It
sucecbsfully by closmg down the Sabha Itself
before the aOl1lversary
One more reason was also attributed for the
Sabha not cdcbratmg Its anntversary Usually
rehable sources saId that the Sabha passed
another Important resolutIOn saymg that
'MusIc IS not the property of one man or
woman; It belongs to the U mverse' . Members
of the 5abha, one after the other, stood true
to the letter of thl~ declaratIOn saywg; 'It
l~ not mine, so let me get out '.
However, the nch fragrance of the soulful
musIc prOVIded by the Sabha appears to have
not only Illevltably echoed III the Ladles Club
HaH, but ab() m the cats ()f the pc()p~e ()f the
campus for such a long time, that they were
happy WIthout a Sangeetha Sabha until last
year
Lord Jalakanteswara, naturally, was not
very mllch Impressed WIth the performance of
the Sabha of hIS consort. He deCIded to give
a supplementary examlOatlOn 10 the form of
the present MUSIC Club. The year-long
tests seems to have been smooth-salhng and
we have come out successful to see through
the first ConvocatIon.
Many factors can be attnbuted to the way
in whIch thmgs were happentng m the Club,
culmlllatmg m the celebratlDn of Its anntversary.
I would Itke to say that the most Important of
them alliS the voluntary co-operatIon extended
by the Vldwaru. In dcceptmg the Club's mVltations. But what prompts them to do so readdy?
Many are the reasons.
For one thmg I have observed that the
artIsts have a keen deSire to see the Indlan
Institute of Technology, Madra-, which IS the
thad III the cham of the five all-IndIa hIgher
technologIcal IflStitutlOns established by the
Government of IndIa under an Act of
Parltament, In pursuance of a Plan prOjected
by the Nalm Ranjan Sarkar COmrruttee
m 1946."
Secondly, v.hlle the vldwans walt for the
audience to assemble either In the Central
Lecture Theatre or Room No. 222 of the
BUlldmg SCIences Block, they get a very good
opportumty to VISIt the Laboratones open
nearby and thereby ennch thelr knowledge
m theIr own fields. I heard that soine of the
artIstes utthse the opportumty to dISCUSS With
the vanous Heads of De partments on techmcal
problems of Interest to them-I mean to the
artIsts ThIS has resulted 111 meamngful
collaboratIon between the performmg artIstes
and the SCIence and englfleenng facultIes of
thiS Institute, which was not positively
foreseen 10 any of the plans of the Institute.
For Instance, as a result of such a Contact
Sri Tlruchl S Sankaran has shown conSIder:
able mterest In a project on 'hmlt anahsls of
stIffened leather surfaces on hollow sheJls·.
The other day, whllewaltmg for the Chemistry
Lecture Theatre to be cleared of a SymposIUm
gathenng, SrI Lalgudl Jayaraman Just peeped
mto the haIl only to be welcomed to partiCIpate
lfi a dISCUSSIOn on • structural and acoustIc
aspects of thin metalliC stnngs'. I also
heard that a Ghatam vldwan was considerably
Interested m a research scheme on 'remforcement by v.elded wire fabriC In burnt clay
sphencal shelJs'.
Apart from all :.uch techmcal assistance thIS
InstItute pro\ Ides to VISiting artistes, certalO
faCIlitIes afforded by the Club ?bo attract
them. Take for mstance the return transport
proVIded after the programme. The vldwans
are unammous III theIr appreCiatIOn for
provldmg the green van to them, to transport
the Thamboura, Veena etc. WIthout any
difficulty They become very grateful to the
InstItute and the Club when they find out,
on rcaclung theIr desttnatlOns that the van
has no fare-meter, unlike the taxIS they
usually get for other City Sabha performdnces.
Unfortunately, there IS a miSConception
prevallmg that all the success achieved by
the Club IS due to the untlnng and palnssaktng efforts of the office-bearers, the
executIve comnuttee and the nnstlnted cooperatIOn extended by the staff and studentmembers etc, etc. To those who hold such
a vIew I would lrke to say very boldly one
thing: 'I am afraid I have to agree With
you '.
