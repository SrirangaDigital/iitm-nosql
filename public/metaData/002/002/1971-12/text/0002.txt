THE INTER· HOSTEL

Among the many loveable ,d,ocyncrasles
that hven up the campus, nothmg IS so nOIsy
and enjoyable as the Inter-Hostel entcrtalllment. They are all there aftel an early

INSTITUTE DEBATE
, After all, the usual lethargic stuff-and m
ChLT of all the places I-I can't thmk of
anyone who can come anywhere near the
standard of R. Shankar or Amlr-and I'm
Sick of these wolf whistles and shneks I ' thls was jUst the general trend of remarks that
ensued In response to the unusual advertisement given tor the mstltute debate-but
these old tImers would have been sadly
disappoInted If they had suddenly deCIded to
attend the debate, because of two reasonsone, the standard was fantastic and two, the
audience, a SIzeable one at that, was an
unusually qUiet one.
The tOpiCS for the marathon prelimmary
seSSIOn were (NudIsm m cmema serves no
purpose' and ' NeutralIty, as a Iastmg
pnnclple, IS a slgn of weakne<.s' and both the
tOpICS were to a certaIn extent misunderstood
by a few speakers, mlsmterpreted by a few
and even misquoted by a few. Some of
them seem to take It for granted that nudism,
nudIty and sex are synonymous-a grave
rrustake mdeed r More sense was expressed
tn conjunction With the other tOpIC which
gave some of our extremists here chance to
teel free to launch an attack on objects of
dlshke and to bluff theIr wmdmg way out of
tIght corners.

[Winter 1971
The final round was more lIke It and it
was clear that at least the partiCipants had
deCIded to take It senously enough-except
for a few stray cases wherc a speaker had to
repeatedly address an empty chair as
'ChaIrman, SIC' and another hero, who
attached demo(.racy to RUSSIa and a couple of
others, who could have held back their Jokes-for such Jokes as those they dIsh out are
normally not hked or apprecIated.
The tOpIC was-' Democracy Invariably leads
to dIctatorshIp m a developmg nation' -and
If one cares to make a CrItlc.!1 analYSIS of
thiS topIc-he might feel that every nation IS
a developIng natIon-and only to what extent
Will bc a pertmcnt questlon-a pomt whIch
was beautifully stressed by a couple of
speakers-thiS view of the tOpIC could m
stages lead us to the conduslon whIch
closes to the tOpiC tn question-that lesser
the development rate of a country, more WIll
be the opportumty for dIctatorshIp to creep
m. But to refer to benevolent dictatorshIp
m thIS context seems rather funny, unusual
and out of place. B. Kumar was hiS usual
self and he made It an easy Job for the
Judges to deCIde about the first place. The
very fact that there were two tICS, one for the
third place and the other for the fourth place,
IS suffiCIent proof of the general high standard
of debate thIS year. Let us hope these chaps
win more and more pnze!. for our InstItute
In the other city colleges.
