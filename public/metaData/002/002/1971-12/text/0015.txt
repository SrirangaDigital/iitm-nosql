CAMPASTIMES

Winter 1971]

(Continued from page

As a race, the Germans are prohably the
most intellIgent people I have come ?cross.
As students of the IlTM, we ought to be
mIghty grateful to them, smce, wIthout them,
thIS mstItute would not eXIst. Yet the person
who chooses the OAT movies has the abysmal
stupIdity to screen movies that show hoVl the
whole of Germany was outWitted by one
asmme-Ioolmg tank (I say tank because It
looked a great deal more mtelligent than Its
crew) One can always pass It off by saymg
that they won't mmd but, as a matter of fact,
they do mmd. To most of us who have no
conceptIOn of the agony that Germany had to
endure towards the end of the war, theIr
ObjectIOn may seem 1l10glcal
But all the
same It eXists. Perhaps we would be able to
understand their feelmgs better If a movie
showing how a PakIstani tank made the Indian
Armed Forces look lIke fools was screened at
the OAT.
In future, at least, we should see to It that
such movies are not screened on the new
plastic screen (compiIments of the Federal
Repubhc of Germany) through our 35 mm.
projector (comphments of the Federal Repubhc of Germany) at the OAT (probably
compliments of the Federal Repubhc of Germany). If we eannot do this much for them,
we can safely place ourselves one rung below
the dogs on the ladder of evolutIOn, for no
dog WIll bite the hand that feeds It.
Let me teU you a story.
The buddmg young author strode down
the corndor wIth a gleam In hiS eye and a
song on hiS lips. He had every nght to feel
chIrpy for had not hIS first ltterary effort
turned up In the campus rag that very day.
Half way down the corndor he was stopped
by a thick lookIng moron in glasses, whose
pea-slZed bram was enveloped 10 a dozen
layers of lard to protect It from the Jars and
jolts of a academIc Me. The thlcko said, 'I
read your stuff yar. It was all @ % "
Had the thlcko been one and a half times
as big as our author he would have probably
found himself In little pieces all over the
lawn. But slOce he happened to be exactly
twice as big as our hero, physical violence was
out of the questIOn The author spluttered,
turned black wlth rage and frustratIOn, rushed
up to hIS room and burst IOto tears. While
the moron went back to hIS room to contlOue
Ius study of the works of one T. N. Raman.
This story may seem chIldish to you but It
serves to 11Iu,trate a pomt There are far too
many stlf-styled hterary cntlCs, who Sit on
their fat backsides and pass Judgement on the
local authors. The large majority of these
CfltlClsm do not contam a slOgle constructive
8uggestIOn and serve only to demoralJse the
few who take the trouble to put pen to paper.
I, for one, am all for the lIttle chap, even If
what he writes turns out to be @% '

Visit by Union Minister
Shn D. P. Yadav, Deputy MlOlster of
Education in the Umon Government, VISited
the InstItue on Sept<.mber 21. After a VISit
to the Central Workshops, Shn Yadav told
the Deputy Director that he thought that
J.LT., Madras had a uniquely commandmg
POSItiOn, amongst all the Institutes, that he
had seen 10 the country, In the matter of Its
abilIty to fabncate technIcal equipment of
high quality.

the mcs~agc of the play, and perhaps due to
our bad interpretation, It would have been fair
to one ,lnd all An off-key condmon of ' While
My Guitar Gently Weeps,' does not drown
th<.- sadness, nor IS It pseudo-mtellcctual.
Such paranOid reference~ to the 'laughable'
play, could have been aVOided by one stentorian 'Money back I ' at the back of the hall.
It would have been true to IITlan traditIOns,
though not so tender m the world of manners.
What, you wonder, IS all thiS In aid of? I
get my kick out of assoclatlOg With thiS German Jew, who has long been dead, who said,
, We are not pn.sentIng the world With a new
pnnclple, saYIng In a doctrmnalre fashion
'Here's the truth-fall on your kneees before
It"
We me dellvlng new prinCiples for the
world, and denvlng them pnnclples already
IOheTlnt 10 the world We are shOWing the
world what It IS III fact fightmg for; and
conSCIOusness IS somethmg the world I must
acqUire, even if It does not want to. So,
that's whe.e It's at And about tho new label
of the great unwashed VIi:. snobs, looks lIke
they don't have a hope In hell. But make a
lIke you meet thl~ doe-eyed thmg who IS a lIttle
less washed than you; your ego IS ahve to the
fact, and VOila, you got your pie! It's aU a
dream, but If It happens, wouldn't It be Just
too much?

ON FISH AND CHIPS .••
, Jackpot' said the gentleman in brown to
the gentleman 10 black and they laughed and
clapped their hanos In glee! Ask Asokan and
he'll gIVe you a hundred vanatlons of thiS, aU
In the same velO As VIJay Reddy once said
we've had the spotted deer, the Kattan and so
much else but thiS Jackpot technICIan takes
the cake. To actually aSCribe such gross
stupIdity to the cream of the country and
think l,e can get away With It, clearly POInts
out to an ImbecIle--and therefore not a
3tudent-but to get away with lt, really shows
that he IS a bIg wig. Man! some big wig!
The dlaboltc plot was actually concened
well before the IdylliC summer vacation.
And knowmg desperation as we so well do, It
obVIOusly could have sprouted m no more
fertile a bralO than m that of one With
medalltc aSpirations. Names were collected
and lists were drawn up-hsts of all the
promlslOg young fish m the first year-the
underpaid, undernounshed suckers-who have
the dub lOllS good fortune to do the lOstltute
colours. In that stage of hush-hush desperation, they even missed out a feW-lIke the
soccer stnker whose real name they didn't
know and a few other decoys-but the
prInCipal fish were all m the net and all that
was reqUired was a skillul hand to draw them
mto the (alas' so renowned) fiver.
Here the varIatIOns and the troubles started.
Rehable sources mdlcate that the Asst.
Warden goofed up somewhere-he was not
able to arnve at the AcademiC SectIOn m
time to get the branches of the young lads
changed. Other knowledgeable ones mSlst
that the big wig knew and really did not
care-after all he IS a big Wig, IS not he? And
whatever for, If not to act like one? Still
others aware that the student member of the
commIttee got cold feet at thiS stage and
washed hiS hands of the whole affair. Ask
him even now, and despite the safety of the
faITly lofty pOSitIOn he holds now, a cherubiC
look of mnDcencc appears on hiS face and you
raise your hat, knowlOg you are 10 the presence of an Ohvler. Whatever It IS, the
precautIOns that shOUld have been taken, were
not and the scheme roared on, unaware of
what was awaIting It.
The brand new semester started and the
probable trouble-makers returned With all the
vigour of not haVIng had to see some authentically stupid mugs 10 class, for a long two
months. The hitches cropped up, one by
one. Some of the young fish slIpped away(Continued neXt page)

At 10-10 the Cashler.m-charge of the
counter saunters In, dusts hiS chair and Sits
down. He then opens all hIS drawers one by
one, and pulls out bundles of currency notes
and sack full ot change. Havmg done thiS.
he proceeds to count the loot.
On the other sld<. of the counter the queue
grows bigger and bigger.
Fifteen mmutcs later the countmg IS finished.
The amount IS entered In the register.
The members of the qu<.-ue become
Impatient. They tell hlffi to get on With It.
He, bcmg fully engros~ed In drawmg hiS
Tabular Column for the Day, pays them no
heed.
Fmallyat 10-50, by which time the queue
has reached mammoth proportions, work gets
started.
If a solutIOn to the problem can be found,
It can never be III these condltlons. It IS
defimtely pOSSible for us to have all the extracurncular actiVIties we want Without neglecting
the academiC rIde to such an extent. But a clImate
must be created In which we can Indulge m
our extra-currIcular activIties Without havmg
to be dnven from pillar to post mutter
desperatIon Red tape has to be shced, and
fast. Else, somethmg has got to suffer.
And what abou.t that third aspect of campus
lIfe, or for that matter hfe anywhere? What
about you? Sorry, bud, you Just don't figure.
You are to go mto hldmg for as long as you
are here and when you pass out, hey presto.
there you are, five years older and out of the
Institute. Like the Idea?

Inter-Regional Seminar on
'Industrial Processing of Rice'
The Instltute was the venue during October
197 1 of an mter-reglonal Semmar on 'Rice
Processlllg '-jOint! Y sponsored by three mternatIOnal organlZatIons, namely, UNIDO, FAO
and ECAFE, and the Government of India.

was placed before them. ' Is the State
Government's aClion justIfied in
scrappmg prohibItion? ' It was found
that 50 0% of the students did not
agree With the deciSion of the State
Government. 43 5% thought the State
Government was Justified m Its action
of lIftIng prohibition, While a small
amount of 6.5% were uncertam about
the actIOn.
VI. Even those who supported the Government's action, did not think 'It was
only remedy to mcet the extra expenditure of the Government'. Only
24 0% felt that It was the 'only way'
open to the State, whde 63 or" did not
thmkso. The remalnIngwereuncertain.
VII Though 43.5% of students supported
the action of the State Government In
scrappmg the prOhibItion, only 37. 0 %
felt that It was done on ratIOnal
grounds.
VIII. To the Question' do you thmk that
It would have been better If the
Government had taken a State-wide
opInIon poll on thiS Issue before
lthlng the prohibItIOn ~, Only 41 5% of
students answered in the affirmatl\ e and
52 •2 5% felt it was unnecessary as the
Government was the elected body of
people, 625% were uncertalll.
IX. It IS mterestmg to find that 64.4% of
students felt that the others around
Will not look down upon them If they
knew 'he drlllks' while 29.0% felt
the other way. Those uncertatn were
70%
X. Surpnsmgly 72.0% of respondents felt
that they would rather let their parents
know about thelT ' drmkIng' habits.
The others preferred to keep theU'
parents in dark of thell 'dnnklllg'.
ThiS m short IS the result of our survey.
We hope there IS no speCial need for a
debate On the Issue whether or not drmkmg
~hould be allowed 10 hostels as 57 0%) feel
m the first IOstance that . dnnkmg' IS bad
and secondly 60 0% feel that It Will mduce
others to dnnk I
