Climate engll~eermg, more precisely defined
as the ngorous study of the techniques employed In the manufacture of standard
envIronment, attamed world-wIde sIgnificance
after the beJl·bottom revolt.
The production of sythetiC weather, commg
In the aftermach of the modern revolution,
stnpped the orthodox sCience of weatherforecasting of all the voodoo and guess-work,
leavtng behmd a mere meteorological appendIX, which, hke the anCient art of
alchemy, passed, slowly but surely, mto the
dusty annals of history. It was the downfall
of a ver), romantiC rnlsunderstandmg between
man and nature
Planetary aIr-condItion mg. one of the pnme
subjects m the vast curnculum of the new
sCIence (whIch CritICS sarcastically called eco'
mama) came mto full \ogue "hen the cutlcal
study of a techmque to distil the halls out of
haIlstorms bore frUit after mnumerable tnals
at variOUS monsoon-workshops speCially constructed for that purpose. The second factor
which added Impetus to the snowbalhng field
was the successful applicatIOn of pIlot-plants
for the testmg of rambow-generator. ThIS
phase of study was made necessary because
the poetic and sentimental element m man
could not be allowed to langUIsh. deprIVed of
the only natural multicolour exhIbItIOn. On
SimIlar lines of reasonmg, deVices such as
thunderclap-machmes \\ere rolled off the
assembly-hne. But the actual fimslung touch
to the picture was entirely due to a systematic
classlficatlon of the tYPical ram-cloud.
Accordmg to thiS convement hypothetical
branchmg, a-CirruS, b-lllrnbus, c-stratus and
d-cumulus were the four chIef strams that
usually caused downpours at unpredIctable
tmungs. By selectIVe comb matlo n. these
could be artIfiCially coupled In the so' called
cosmIC cotton factones and stimulated by
seedmg agents rangmg from bactena to lodme
crystals and radiOactive Isotopes. The result109 bl-clouds could then be placed 10 coldstorage and retaIled to consumers as and when
the orders dropped 10.
At a museum, VISItors stare In amusement
at a decrepIt black umbrella, a rehc from
the past.
SynthetIc snowflakes were sellmg hke hot
cakes (or IS It cold?) on the season supermarket. Available ID dIsposable plastIC cartons
in a vanety of colours for those who wanted
a pleasmg mstant alpme enVironment, the
flakes were seen III advertisements which had
come to replace the weather-maps In the
dallIes Meanwlule, several projects were
launched to m.esugate the feaslb!llty of
manufacturmg prefabncated fogs to gIVen
speCificatIOns for a certain number CItIes.
ThIS was because of a growmg ataVIstiC
demand among some city-counCils for an
occasiOnal touch of history to enltven the
streets on drab days, of course, on festive
occasIons, a JudiCIOUS spray of a-Cirrus and
c-stratus on the dome of the sky formed the
festoons, whIle a controlled breeze added to
the general feelmgs.

The society for the preservation and fostering of atmospherIC sanctity was fOlUlded to
keep accounts on the proper Side As a
symbol of theIr earnest mtentlOns, the
members unantmously chose the anerOId
barometer. SpecIalizatIOn 10 weather·productlon had mCreased to the pomt whue frost
of the onent became the patent<.-d monopoly of
one factory, while equatofJal typhoons were
the delicacy handtd out from another.
Standard hurn<.ancs were exported to n<.-cdy
countries by merchants who ruled the trade
wmds among the tropical regIOns. Shlppmg
industries Wlrc reqUired to pay nommal
amount of sads·tax to the breeze-barms. All
transactIons "ere carned out In an atmosphere
of commtrce. If the consumers wue dissatISfied with th<.- w<.ather, thLy could c.xchangL It
for a b<.Hcr bargam. For example, Islands

there was no harmful gase!> like ozone and
oxygen m any gIven volume of the atmosphere.
SCIentists pomted out that a plentiful supply
of exhaust fumes and mdustnal effluents,
so nounshlng to hVlng cells, would displace
all noxIOUS elements of natural aIr (rncludmg
nitrogen) and thus create an mVlgouratmg
blanket around the globe. Traces of onglnal
aIr (which, mCldentally. were held wholly
responSible for mahma) would be cleared off
by se\eral osmot\<. suckers Installed at vanOU'l
pomts of latitude.
ThIS recreated aumuffler would be controlled by electrodes
placed at the north and south poles and
alternate demagnetization would genelate
a steady, Uniform current of polar wmds.

Actually, the clxmax came when the socalled sCience of season-swltchmg became
practIcal. As for the clouds, a-summer
b-spnng, c-autumn,
d-wlnter were the
recogntzed subdiviSIOns. By an adjustable
arrangement of season·fractlOns, people
could purchase a packaged partial wmter or
choose (With a discount as added mcentlve)
the raw materials for constructmg a wholesale
spring. Several blue gamblmg-houses began
functIonmg With all-season Jam sessIons where
the outcome of freely mlxmg the four known
components was a matter to be guessed
(under finanCial duress). Smce almost all
vegetation could be kept mdefimtely evergreen by a SUItable applicatIon of seasonlng.
greenhouses and orchards multlphed III yxeld,
although numerous herbIvores testified that
the products tasted hke mud, or lacked
essentlal perfume. SCientIsts were qUick to
observe that tasteless, odourless compounds
were mcomparably pure. Flowers were soon
replaced by aromatic hydro carbons retailed
10 puffer-packs for comfortable apphcatlon
to the organs concerned. Eevery:nowand then,
speCIally eqUipped hosmg hehcoptors were
aSSigned to Imtlate the wet sea~on for those
localttles where summer waS bemg Withdrawn
from normal cIrculatIOn. The mOist earth
would be burstmg mto crystalhne hfe: With
the dehcate aroma of benzene, and old-timers
would take a nostalgIC breath: of ImprovIsed

1. The rustling of the waves
The whistle through casuarina
The smell of freedom
I carry
Hasty jor the continuous confluence oj the elements.
2. The wait is my need

Anchored
as I am
jor those everchanging yearly
patterns
The jruit is my burdenI hear the ominous hacking
of axes
But my merry jriend arrives
carrying many a mixed smell
come jree, come wander
Freedom would be a
Stranger
Were your shackles not to extend
and transport the feeling
of distances
