CAMPASTIMES

The Security OHlcer
Among the many sights that the fresher,
new from school, sees ill tlus campus of ours,
there IS one that sucks to lus memory and, for
the first few days at least, puzzles him no endthat of a hefty gent, wearmg whites, who
astflde a motorIZed two wheeler, roars about,
breakmg the pe:lce of the 'sylvan campus'
and IS seen sometlmes, now ill huge boots
and belts, leadmg a ragged khalu-c1ad ltttle
army through a senes of military manouevers.
Who IS he? None other than the Supreme
Commander, Field Marshal and Commander
ill chIef of the LI.T. Armed Forces, or rather
the quamtly named' Watch and Ward' whIch
guards aU of us, the boys, the too few gIrls,
the profs. etc from aggression by the Vela chenTaramam VIllage complex HIS name IS
(General, please) T. N Venkataraman and he
combmes ill himself, besIdes the aforementIOned posts, those of resIdent Sherlock
Holmes, ChIef Deer Keeper, Head Forest
Ranger and FIre Chief, to mention Just a few.
We were surprised too
ThiS sleepless guardian of our peace IS not,
despite the optnlon of some of us, fat. He
is Just hefty-any chan would have ItS arms
full supporting him. HIS face IS tanned a
healthy ltght brown, he speaks an oldfashIOned, but fluent Enghsh With occasIOnal
philosophical comments in Taml\. HIS
office, the G H Q. or nerve center, contams
two telephones, IS ltberally covered With
graphs upon whIch coloured pms IndIcate the
number of deer kIlled (slightly less than one
per week, for the statistics hungry), the

number of trespasses, fires, etc., but at least
not very often, the man hImself, for he IS of
the healthy outdoor type and prefers to be
out on Ius roads rather than to Sit 10 hiS
office recelvmg complamts These last are
mostly about cycles-both lost and found (10
a week), whose m}sterlOus dIsappearances are
explamed when one understands that along
with all the profs., lecturers (ugh I) and
students, there IS also a large number of
N.M.Rs. and students, who, taking a fancy
for one's poor two-wheeler can easily remove
it, there just not belflg enough watclunen to
look after all the cycle-parks, creatmg Just one
of Mr. Venkataraman's headaches. The
others, too numerous to mention, are caused
malOly because m this campus, the resldenttal
and college areas are not as separated as they
should be, makmg it difficult for the collegebuildIngs to be protected adequately from the
fanCIes of the daIly-waged crowd.
For those who :ream for bIographical data,
Mr. Venkataraman IS from Tnchy, got
a credItable Arts Dt'gree from there, was
Under Officer In the U O.T.C (then eqUivalent of the N C C.) "hleh mlhtary hackground
led to hiS JOIDtng 'he Madras SpeCial Armed
Poltce, and havmg had 'always a hktng for
the adventurous hfe', partICIpated tn, and
led, many merry hunts for dacoits, naxahtles,
and other Bad Guys. He IS, as we mentioned
earlier, the athletic type, and ID hiS more
streamlined days, used to win 800 m and mde
rac~s. Besldls all thIS he was â€¢ very Interested In the Fmc Arts, espeCIally dramatiCS',
and whenever taken off the leash, used to
turn up on stage.

[Winter 1971

His attitude towards us IS friendly 'After
all, I was once a student too' He inSISts,
however, that we learn self-dISCIpline', unless
you learn to obey and to abide by the rules,
you can't become a good leader' etC. etc.
Don't turn away nauseated, there IS good
news to Come. He reads Campastzmes' when
I can get it' (Q()t very often, apparently) and
tbmks we are makmg , a good lob of It'. With
a gleam m hiS eyes, he started telllDg us a
few schemes he has m mmd to Improve lIfe
in the campus (use surplus land for vegetable
and daIry farms)
It has been just about a decade or so since
he moved mto I I.T Then It was a Wild,
desolate jungle, no roads, no flats, no HSB,
MSB etc. and no secunty force either. Now
of course, It has grown enormously, what" ith
roughly 40 crores (I) of equipment and bemg
responSible for the safety of It all WIth a pamfully understaffed watch and ward, has not
been good either for hiS beauty sleep or hiS
motor-bike. Sull, he says the Job IS not as
hard, as gt1ardmg a factory, say, of equal sIze
and does leave him time for temus, dally
viSitS to the temple, and keeps hIm always on
the get up and go. So next time you contemplate murder, arson, rape or Just plain, petty
larceny, beware, you may very likely find the
Secunty Officer, red beret and all ('there
must be somethmg to dlstmgUl~h a SecurIty
Officer from a non-Secunty Officer) WIth a
couple of hIS minions, breathing down your
neck.
