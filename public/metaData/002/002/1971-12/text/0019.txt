Winter 1971]

CAMPASTIMES

-----------------------------------

common sense to see the pomt In takmg along
athletes who run the 1,500 m m 5 minutes
when the timing for the third pOSitIOn In
the Meet IS 4 m 38 sec. When the first five III
the meet all do below 11.7 sec.
For the last two years we have taken along
athletes who do to rounds of the track and
give up (m 5,000 m) claIming they have
got cramps etc. If a guy IS not upto the
standard, then why he wants money from the
stnngcnt Gymkhana budget on hIm? It IS
high lime we set quahfying marks for
selectIOns.
The Madras T. T. standard IS nothmg to
rave about. The last five meets proved that.
And we don't seem to be domg anythmg
about It. We have never had proper selections. ThiS year selections were held for the
fifth player only I Are the top four !lcored of
bemg dIsplaced? Unless proper selections
are held, there IS no mcentlve for newcomers
to corne forward and for those already on the
team to strive harder. Even now It IS not
too late.
Madras, 1970. History starts a new chapter.
Madras wms the Inter-IIT meet general
champIOnship for the first time. This Will
heralded the cltm3J.., the end result of years of
perseverance and dogged determmauon, of the
• will to Win'. But It was not roses all the

wali

ever any team fought ridicule, ever
rose from obscunty to eminence, It IS the
hockey team. Every year It was the same
old story. They would practIce tlil 'the
noon-day sun was up', but would lose the
very first match at the meet. But finally the
tOil paid off In Kharagpur when Madras took
the hockey Silver, a mere stepping stone to the
gold at Madras.
For four consecutIve meets, our athletics
team failed to chck Then out of the blue
came Bhasker. Under hiS Insplflng captamcy
our athletes gave mercunal performances.
No wOll.der we ran away With the athletics
champIOnship.
Kanpur, 1967, 6th Inter-lIT Meet. Jubilation. Madras takes the volley ball stiver.
A dramatic n~e from obscunty to honour,
to glory. Though we let go our hold In
Khragpur, we fought back strongly to take the
suver at the Madras
The T. T. Team has toded hard but no
success so far. But the addltlon of internallonal K. Jayant shollid change that.
The place Kharagpur the year 1969 The
man LIOnel Paul, Madras claimed the gold as
he thrammed all OPPOSition dropping Just
one game In sur sets' We retamed the trophy
agam last year but we had to fight ha~d
to do so.
Here's hoping Cap tam RaVl
Shankar Will carry on the good work.
Kanpur 1968 Madras retams the Basket
ball trophy for the third year in successIOn.
1969 saw the whole crack team pass out.
Madras were set the task of ralsmg a new
team In Just four months, a team that could
match the powerful Bombay and Kanpur
teams. How well we managed was reflected
m the way Madras went down fighting by
,just four pomts to Bombay III the finals.
But we bounced back to the top the follOWing
year at Madras ,
The Shuttle team never really made the
lunehght till the actIOn packed matches
In Kharagpur.
With the former State
ChampIOn EdwID around, things look bnght
for dus team.
Kudos to the gymnastics team for their
stetlmg performance last year I With the
solid practice they are puttIng In thIS year, we
can be sure of come cruCial pomts from our
gymnasts.
Of aU the teams the most controver'llal
IS the Foothall team.
It rose to royal, diZZy
heights and III Its dIZZiness fell. It fell a prey
to It'S own c:Jmplacency But last year the
Madras camp saw a new team rrsmg from the
ashes of Its defeat and hold at bay the powerful Kharagpur pack before narrowly lOSing
to them
In all fairness one must admit Madras has
always had It tough m sports. But then
we ourselves are to blam(. for our low
stalJdards, for the stagnation we have cnated.
It IS not dIfficult for anyone With even a little

CRICKET
Inter-University
With A GRam Smgh coachmg the team,
we are really hot. With an unbeaten record
m mter-colleglate and WIth that extra some
thmg that always comes out for the December
mela and not to forget the dedicated captainIng of that veteran of many battles, Varada~
raJan, we must put the fear of Allah Into
even our big brother neighbour, Madras.
The battIng has depth In Bhuvaneswar
(Boobs), Ramkl, Mahesh, Gown and last
but not the least the skipper. The bowling
