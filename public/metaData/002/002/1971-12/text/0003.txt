--------------------------------------------------------------------------PNV: What do you feel about overbasis

jYleel

s.

matches?

SV . They arc mterestlng III theIr own way;

VENKATARAGHAVAN

He walks half a dozen paces; stops,
stnughtens hIs hall' glides III past the
umpire (m between him and the wicket if he
wants to get a bit more of bite from the
pitch) and dehvers the ball; It mayor may
not get a wlcl..et (oftcn It does) but It IS always treated with respect; he follows
through, the hair all over hiS forehead. He
is S. Venkataraghavan.
He crouches at the wicket; l\1s stance seen
from the Side IS ungainly but a~ the wiseguy
remarked, you don't bowl from square leg.
The ball IS dehvered and down comes one of
the straightest bats 10 the country. The ball
drops dead and India knows It can breathe m
comfort. He IS S. Venkataraghavan.
He glances at the bat~mall from gully. HIS
feet Wide apart, hiS arms m front, relaxed and
tense at the same time, concentratmg on that
edge of the bat He may be at leg shp or
short leg ready to dive mto the stroke, to the
ecstacy of hIS countrymen and hiS dry cleaner.
He IS Venkataraghavan
He welcomes me With a fnendly pat and
makes the usual enqumes about the 2nd
cousm, the dog, etc. Then a lIttle talk about
the I I. T mOVies, Eddie Snmvasan's shuttle
apaCltles (he IS an enthUSIastic badmmton
player) and we get gomg, the questIOn and
answers bemg mterrupted often by wise cracks
and P.Js.
We start:-

PNV: What made you take upto off-spm
bowlmg?

SV : It was ImmedIately after school I
thmk' tIll then I was a medIum
pacer. One day in the nets I was
casually trytng to bowl otf-spmners
and found I could bowl much better.
PNV: What was the feature of your cncket
In P S. High School?
SV : Well, I was an all-rounder with the
accent on battIng then.
PNV : Was there anv change m your prioritIes (battmg, bowlIng) after JOl1llJlg
the Engmeerlng College ~
SV : There was very much of a change
towards bowlmg. It wasn't very
much at the college level where
I stIll made my runs but it was
III other matches
PNV: What was the most satlsfymg performance of yours mInter-CollegIate
cncket and what do you thmk of
mter-colleglate CrIcket m Madras 10
general ~
SV : My most sattsfying performance was
WIth the bat. I made 98 not out
agalllst P.S G. COImbatore m the
Duncan Tournament at the Manna.
You were also there watchlOg the
match, weren't you?
There seems to be a general feel109 that the standard of intercollegiate cncket has gone down.
But the performance of the Madras
Umverslty III Rohlllton Barla has
been splendid whIch means that the
standard has been mamtamed If not
lffiproved.
But, one thmg I WIll say. Ten
years back, there used to be 4 or 5
players at least from the college
playmg for the State. Now there
IS not even one Even when I
played for the State, Satwender,
RaJendran and Ramesh played
PNV: You have been playlOg Madras league
Cricket for a long time What do you
think about It, In general ~
SV : Well, unfortunately, It IS dommated
by a few teams. Institutions recruIt
people for therr crIcket and cncket
seems to revolve round company
teams hke State Bank, Indian Overseas Bank, Jolly Rovers and
Alwarpet.
It IS ,no longer club
CrIcket. We actually need 2 leagues'
one for clubs, one for compames
'
PNV; Do you like bowling mane-day
matches ~
BV : I enJoy bowlIng anywhere.

people want results; they don't hke
draws.
PNV. Ha~ there been any change 10 your
type of bowling recently i
SV : No It varies accordmg to the conditions, perhaps
PNV. There IS a school of thought that says
that one-day matches tend to make a
bowler, bowl shghtly flatter. What
do you have to say about It ~
SV : Absolutely true. He has to contalO
the batsman and tends to push It
through. In England, countybowlers play III the John Player
League on Sunday and revert to
county CrIcket the next mormng.
They find It qUite difficult.
PNV: Have you tned to model your bowlmg
on any other off-splllners ?
SV
No.
PNV. What was the bIg break through 10
your career ?
SV : Yes It was the day I got 6-51 for the
combllled UniVerSities. You saw the
match, didn't you?
PNV: Yes, I did and you were run-out;
weren't you?
SV : Yes; that was a damned good throw
from long-on on to the stumps as
I was gomg for my 3rd run.
PNV: What was the most satlsfymg expenence of yours for the State?
SV . It hasn't oecurred yet.
PNV: Have you had any disappointments
In your cncketmg hfe ?
S V : The Austrahan tour by India when
I wasn't taken.
PNV: But you came back strong enough
to become the Vice-Captain very
soon.
SV : Yes I dId
PNV: How do you prepare before you go 'to
a match?
SV . Nothmg at all; I just take It easy.
PNV: What were your reactIOns when you
first played for India, that too In
Madras?
SV
Well I was thnlled that I had been
gIven a opportuOlty to show my
worth even durmg my college days.
Studymg EngmeerIng and pJaYlllg
test cncket at the same tIme was
tough. You can take It from me
PNV: What were your feelIngs when your
8-72 and 4-80 sent the KlWIS fiymg ?
SV : It was great. I was happy that even
m my first senes I had won a match
and the senes for IndIa.
PNV' What are your memories of the 1967
tour of England ~
SV . The weather was absurd; we dIdn't
have a full day's CrIcket before the
first test; lots of problems; injUrIeS
and too short a tour to reCover
from them; not very happy
But the
memOrIes, I'm afrald.
Wickets were a little faster than
thiS year.
PNV: What are the feelings that come
uppermost 10 yow: mmd when you
dunk of thlS tour?
SV : After the victory III the West Indies,
we were fairly confident of takmg the
Englishmen on theIr home grounds.
I feel we have set up a precedent
now whIch can be followed
PNV: What made us Win ?
SV : Team SPlflt. Then bnlltant close-lllfielding, then leadershIp.
PNV: I heard you take 9 Wickets agamst
HampshIre. Was there anythmg
particularly menacmg about your
bowhng that day ?
SV . Well, the record books say that it
was the best bowlmg performance
by an Indian outSide the country.
I must have bowled well; quite a
few spmners also used the wlcket
that day WIthout getting too much
out of It. Anyway it made me
feel great.
PNV: In which pOSition do you like to field?
SV : Anywhere close in, my favourIte POSltlOn IS gully
/
PNV. What makes a good gully fieldsman?
SV : Sharp reflexes and concLntration the
