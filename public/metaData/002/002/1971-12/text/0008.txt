I.I.)TIAN (ALCOHOLIC) SPIRIT

BLIGHTED RAT RACE
Welc:ome to Ratsville. A fantastic generation of rats hole It over here. And they are
qUIte an exclUSive set, almost all male.
These rats dwell In dmgy deephole
communes, each rat havmg a rather symmetrIc
hole for himself; feed, as all rats do, on
rubb1sh about which they are constantly
cnbblng and dOIng nothmg; and when they
come {Jut It IS generally to chew one another
up.
Every year the authorities In charge of thiS
commumty or the Estabhshment which IS a
fancy name the rats give them, mtroduce a
few female rats m Increasmg numbers, to
thiS frustrated majority male communlly. Of
course the males go mad over them for some
tune. That IS for SOmetime. They find that
most of the female fats are not anyway With
theIr tails, and the test are not at all cooperative, they Just gloat 111 theIr own holes
and tantalize the desperate males. And tlungs
have been like that for sometime over here.
The EstablIshment IS out to harass these
rats and maJ..e lIfe as miserable as possible
for them. So at the beglnnmg of every year,
where the rather Incumbent EstablIshment,
IS allOWIng them to settle down, the rats get
brave and elect a leader to represent their
grIevances to the authontle~ The leader IS
a fine rat himself, who makes great promIses,
tng talk and even manages to diSillUSIOn
himself. Very soon the scales fall free-fare
hiS eyes, he realises the very futlhty of even
approachmg the Establishment. So he himself
is dIsgruntled and sornehow tnes to serve hIS
term OUt. And once again the rats talk of a
new leader, a new fronuer, for the next year.
Ever sInce the Estabhshment set up this
unportant community, It has been devIsmg
methods to finger these poor rats. Thus a
unIque system "as developed. Very penodlcally the rats are compelled to eat hrnlted but
suffiCIent doses of rat pOIson. They are fGr
breV1ty called ' periodIcals', WIth no mention
of the pOlson m them. All rats differ m theIr
reactions to theu 'perl.odlcals'. Some grow
Sick, Some more SIck and so on. The behaVioural characteristics of each rat are studied
by the Estabhshment. Each rat has a number,
and gets a grade next to hiS number. The
rats soon find that they Just can't fight thiS
system, so at least they could start working
for It Ultimately the ambition of every rat
IS to make the rughest grade, Which IS very
highly regarded. Most of them don't make
tlus grade and these rats get so Sick, that
every ' penodlcal ' evemng they puke out the
whole Injustice of the system, and howl about
what a rat raCe the whole thll1g IS. Others
talk of untapped capaclhes and keep promlsmg
themselves that they would fair better the
next time. StIll others, damned as pseudomtellectuals, find a column to lllbble at m
their campus publicatIOn Campastimes which
has thereby become somewhat of a source
book 011 all such matters.
Fmally the rat commUnI ty got so desperate,
that they sent an ambassador over to lIT
Madras, to seek solutIOns to their problems.
But the lIT ambassador promptly replied
'We don't have any of your problems '.

Some people have the 'sick' habit of behavmg In a pccuhar way for 11.0 reason at all
and our campus IS not lackmg m such characters. These people seem to forget the fact
that a good Is~ue of Campastlmes depends very
much on the Interest of one and aU III both
'~ntlng more and more good articles and also
ill bemg shghtly morc conSiderate towards the
editor-for after all, there IS nothing much he
can do about It-and such glaringly stupid
actIOns hke throwl11g It away as trash even
before the smallest glance l11to pages 1 to 16
and starting false rumours all round can In no
way help SUch an uncontrollable and hopeless mass of decomposition, so deeply engendered can only pollute the gay mmds even If
lack of Interest and deprlvatlOll had not loaded
it With their mtanglblc ImpuntJes.
An educatIOnal mstltutlon Which has got the
power to Impose certam rules and regulatIOns
On 'campus populi' should also be careful In
its Ylews regardmg the upkeep of the sanctity
of the place. To-day, there Will be a film
shootmg here, tomorrow a couple of tOUrIst
buses wIll barge m and the day after, It will
become a PICCHC spot, something which IS
definitely undeSirable even though maJonty of
the student community may not mtnd thiS.
Though such matters as these don't tlckle
anyone (not eVen me) It IS better we give It a
little more thOllght.
Every IITlan, at least after a couple of
years of hiS life in the campus, gets used to
a pecuharly framed English language, which
could safely be a seCret code outSide-not that
there IS anyone or anythmg to blame-not that
there IS anythmg wrong-wlthl11 the hberty,
equaltty and fratermty of our campus, It can be
used freely and Without any reserve but sometimes, we hear some stray cases of certain
people gettmg , ragged' about 'much sick'
words bemg used by our chaps-a small fact
whIch suggests that we had. better see to it
that the frequent use of a few words be slowly
tapered down-somethll1g which most of us
are gomg to find It extremely difficult to
follow. It IS surpnslI1g to note that our
language 15 gettll1g popular even among !'oroe
staff members
It IS reatly Interestmg and grabfymg to note
that most of the top secretanes of the Gymkhana have started working With renewed
Ylgour With LntlreJy new Views and Ideas and
lack of co-operation and co-ordmatlon, whu,h
a few were foreed to ~uspect had gone mto
obltvlOn. But sull there lS a general 111feelmg among the vanous sectIOns hke the
steering commmee, the staff members and a
highly undeslr<\hle complamlI'tg attitude-not
because of any fault of theirs but because th(:y
arc gOlOg to unbounded extents of senousness and over-(:nthu5Iasm. Ou.r InStitutIOn IS
not a ' democracy' (as someone kept mSlsttng
a lew days back)-we are not polltlclans but
we are Just her~ to learn, to develop mterest In
sports, literary actiVIties, fine arts, entertainment and to develop good relations With the
outSiders-and there IS no tleed for a sense
of nvalry and bitterness. So why not Our
heroes relax for a while an.d leave all the
fightlOg and flvalry to the po!thctans outside?
To err I~ huma.n and Just a note of warmng
followed by forgiveness could be a more strategic move than protest.

We recently conducted an Opinion poll
mSlde the campus, on the burning que ... tlOn
of prohibition and Itq suspensIon In the sUte.
GOing found the campus, With a questlOnnatre
was real Jun Students were very much.
lUterested to find a patient listener to talk to.
They were willing to denude their hearts to
us, to corne out With Ideas, VICWS, 0pullons,
belIefs and disbelIefs etc We found a way
to expr~ss their feelings through thiS survey.
The number of samples was only fifty,
absolutely randomly selected to Overcome
the sample bias. The mtervlewers feel that
the sample Size was <ldequate as the r<-sults
obtamed are very Consistent. However we
do not deny the fact that largel, the sample
Size, better the valIdity of result~.
Whde seekmg the ~tudents' VIews on
prohibitIOn an attempt was made to probe
mto their personal habits
We diVided the questlonnalle lOto two parts.
The fitst part essentially dealt With the
biographIcal data while the second part on
prohibitIOn and the government's action.
Here we go With our findmgs.

By the way, we started With the assumption
that students would be gOing regularly to
Gumdy Races. They go very often, alrIght,
to GUlndy (I~) Don't worry 1 Statistics
given here are not Incorrect They go to
Gumdy to make uSe of the Engmeermg

The findmgs are summarised as follows 1. To our Simple and stratghtforward
question 'Do you thInk drmklng IS
good?' 29.6% were m favour and
57 0% were strongly agaInst. The

II. One third of students felt that dnnkmg
is good for health feaSOn$ About
:.:2.17% were not sure about Alcohol a~
It medlcme but 44 5% were definite that
It had no medlcmal value.
III. Our respondents seemed to be tempted
by others, habIts. When they were
asked, do you thmk that hftmg of
prohibition Will tempt even the teetotaller to dnnk?' M.ljority of them
answered 'YES' (60%). Only 2.2%
wereuncertam and those who responded
negatIVely were 37 8%.
IV. 490% of students felt that scrappmg
of prohibition wlll lead to Immorality and crime (How about that?)
Those who (lid not thmk so were
35.6% the remammg were uncertam.
