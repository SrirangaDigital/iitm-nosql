nearlv all of them can enter college only
because their parents look upon a bachelor's
degree or a master's degree as so much less
dowry to pay, or, at a slightly higher level of
modernization, as so much lficrease in their
marriage value and what is worse, about 80%
of the gIrls too, conSider college just as a step
between marnage and Its consequent seCUrIties.
The concept of a UnIversity as a place where
(I) usable knowledge IS gamed. (2) The outlook IS widened, values are questioned or in
other words the bram IS used to thmk and thmk
constructively, or at least to Crttlclse and

TakIng a broader View, however, one sees that

Intellectually (and otherWise) towards Its

[Winter 1971
India returns to Its not-so far back vtllage
onglns, satIsfies Its exhibitIOnist needs and
displays Its contempt for authority and the
environment. I must say that I admire lots of
people III thiS world--the lab-doers, the
lab-coggers, the beautiful people, the groovy
peopk--I admire them all, but most of all,
1 admIre that rebellious non-conformISt who
loftily dlsdalmng the use of tbe (filthy)
• convenlt."nce' does hIS WOrk by Its outSide
walls, and walkb off uncaring.
There IS a saymg, • the frog In the well
knows nothing abollt the ocean', of which
I am reminded each time I leal (ul;wl) through
magazmcs hke • The Plam truth/ , (note the
punctua1lOnal pun) and' the Reader s DIgest',
when It talks about youth and drugs--for
that's what they are, frogs croaktng up the
wells of theIr clo·ed minds who cannot and
WIll not open theIr minds and try to understand the beauty and morality are unstable,
everchanglng concepts which arise out of and
reflect the ne,eds of, people at a parucular
time and age<. What bugs me most IS that
these magazines even when they declare that
they are being broad-mmded and honest never
~ get out of dISCUSSing and critIclzmg the activIties of the under twenty-five generatIOn
outSide the framework of theIr values and
ethICS. LIke a man lookmg through a telescope, who so long as he IS keepmg It In one
pOSItIOn, can see far, but only what lies In that
one dIrectIOn, these pIety trIppers peer
through the telescope of rehglous morahty and
Judge the whole world by what they see.
USing half-truths, a heaVily sarcastic style of
WrIting and colourful photographs (ThIS, by
the way, IS the Glossy Photograph Syndrome
--anythmg }lIustrated by bIg, shmmg
photograph has to be truthful and right) they
achieve Journahstlc dlstortlon--the report109 of events In such a way that the reader
feels that he IS a fool If he does not thmk the
\'lay the magazine wants him to thmk, and the
damage IS done, the hypnOSIs IS over, the
biaSIng IS complete. The' young people'
have been dismIssed as Immoral, misgUided,
ugly, etc. etc. The members of the System
have found valtdatiOn and strength and support
m the prInted word.
