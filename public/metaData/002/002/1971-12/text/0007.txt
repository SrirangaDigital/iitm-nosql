SECOND GYMKHANA MEETING

The Gymkhana has always been concentrating on ex.tra-curncular acttvltles and never
really went deep mto the problems faced by
both the staff and students of this Institute.
The Gymkhana this year seems to have taken
an entlrely dIfferent attItude-probably a
matter of grave concern for some ardent supporters of the eXIsting pattern. The second
meetmg of thzs Gymkhana has brought to
bght some of the gravest problems which
mIght even tend to bring all hfe on the campus to a standstIll m no tIme.
'Re-orgamsatlOn of the Gymkhana office'
the second Item on the agenda was taken up
first followtng the suggestion by a reluctant
preSIdent that an Item hke 'staff evaluatIon'
could be dIscussed 'later '. We often see certam notiCeS commg up on the notice boards
several days after the matter concerned has
been over and closed. And thIS IS a problem
faced by our enthUSiastic steertng commIttee.
One suggestlOn was to remove the P.T.I.'s
altogether and have one clerk for each wang of
the Gymkhana and a coach for every game.
The eXIsting system of diVISIon of work roto
large umts mvanably leads to great delay and
confusIon once a partIcular P.T.I. IS on
leave. The office tlmtngs are such that \\hoever wants somethlllg done has to cut classes
and wuh the hrmted tlme he has, he finds
the clerk's chair empty most of the tIme.. '"
Another suggestion was that an assistant be
appOinted for each of these umts so that he
can take up the full Job If the clerk or P. T.I.
IS absent and also share the work rest of the
t.me. But as one of the members put tn,
dus IS Just trying to defend the present officebearers rather than an attempt at solVing the
problem. A third suggestIon was to appomt
a full-tIme office-bearer of the rank of a
lecturer or about that level, who could be a
connectmg Imk between the preSIdent and the
others and also to do hIS work 1fl hIS absence.
ThIS person could also help In ' makmg someone work' If that someone IS found to be otherwise engaged or absent. A fourth suggestIOn was to ad\ertlse for a phYSical dIrector or
someone hke that and give the P T.I.'s
another chance-but If we are to take these
suggestions, we are faced With the pachydermal questlon-who WI\I thIS neW office-bearer
be-where do we get hIm?
If we expect the Gymkhana to have powers
such as expressions of rroblems and suggestion of changes 10 what goes on here, as one
member suggested, It IS tIme for us to frame
the ConstitutIOn of the Gymkhana before the
end of thIS year at least.
Amidst pm-drop silence, (a rare feature In
meltlngs of thIS kind) Mr. Plplam then came
up With a thoughtfully and carefully planned
scheme for staff evaluatIOn by the students.
It IS gratifYing to notc that the lady members
present showed keen interest In thIS matter
and al1 flIppancy and Itght hearted chatting
disappeared from the other sections of the
members present.

CAMPASTIMES
Whereas a student IS penahsed when he falls
to understand the subject, what about the
staff members { Whereas 10 foreign unlverSltles and even In I I.T. K N.P., staff evaluatIOn IS a regular feature, why not tn IITM {
There was one ;,ugge"uon that the results be
pubh~hed Ifl Call1paSilmes but thIS agam
mIght create problems-the students who are
under the same lecturer next year, might tend
to have a bla~ed opmlOn from what they have
seen about lum 10 Campasttmes. Smce a lecturer 15 openly publtshed as bad, thIS would
be penahsmg hIm to a great lxtent and the
attitude of a Jalge sectlOn of the staff might
suddenly change because of thIS
Accordmg to Mr PlpldDl, we have to conSider 1hlS from the hght of the fact that the
behavIOur of the staff members and theu mdifferent attitude, lack of closeness and commUnication would certamly reduce the educative value of our curnculum. ThiS neceloSItatcs the careful study of every teacher here
WIth rl'spect to (I) expleSSlon (2) speed at
which he goes (3) knowledge of the subject
(4) attitude and effort to make the course mterestmg (5) whether he tells us what he wants
to do tn the next class or not.
A careful evaluatIOn of the course Itself IS
also of equally great Importance. We have to
conSider whether the course content IS too
much or IS It enough. A thorough knowledge of fundamentals should be an Important
feature of every course. We have to study
Whether a proper understanding of the subject
is made pOSSible or not, whether there are
any repetitIOns, whether the standard IS low,
whether the pre-requIsites for the course
have been fulfilled, whether the orgarusatlOn
of the course IS at random or does It go step
by step. Every lecturer should gIve a bnef
lecture about what exactly WIll be done in the
subsequent lectures and a defimte plan should
be gIven to the class. The tutOrial system
has to be carefully studied WIth respect to
the knowledge of the tutor, hl'l power of expresslQn, co-ordmatlOn between lecturer and
tutor, the necessity for the tutonal and Its
dUration. The laboratory system should be
stu<hed WIth respect to Its set up, the faclJ
hues available. the knowledge of the mstructor,
adequacy of mstructlons, co-ordmatlOn
between practlcals and theory, and the mode
of evaluatIOn of practlcal records, for whIch
there should be a set procedure, and finally
the staff should not be out antagomsttc to a
suggestIOn hecause It come from the student.
So much for the staff-but the student
should also be evaluated-how TJ)uch could
he follow? how co-operatIve he was Were
the texthooks prescrIbed avadable or was he
just struggling to take down notes In cl~s
and m the process faded to understand anythmg? Are cyclostykd notes necessary? If
they are, when should they be provIded?
A procedure whIch could be followed IS
thls--every student Will be glven programmed cards ImmedIately after he fintshes an
examinatIOn and he Will be reqUIred to fill
10 With respect to the POInts discussed above
(Just certam tick marks) and after he has
been graded m that partIcular subject, the box
Will be broken open and a record of the
verdict about the lecturer Will be kept by the
head of the department. The follow-up
effects and steps are even more Important
than the mtroductlOn and conduct of thiS
evaluatIOn for there Will always be the
pOSSibIlity where thIS mIght Just be Ignored,
for a'llt stands now, accordmg to the present
state of aflaus, complaInts to the heads of
department Just don't work.
One suggestIOn was to appoint a Jury to
study the rcsults of the evaluation and to keep
a record of the results and also to see that
the verdicts are passed to the heads of
departmtnt.
Mr. Plplam then contmued with a few
suggestIOns which could help the student.
The students tn the Juntor classes could take
help from a group of counCIllors who could
help them out whcnever they 'don't know
what's happemng', A system of loans to
those who have to pay theIr fees urgently and
have to walt for some time for the money to
Come from home was another good suggestlOn
of hIS.

Supplementary exammations are Just ltke
a long-term disease which accumulate more
and more ID certam cases and In the process
affects the students concentration tn the other
subjects. One way of gettmg nd of thiS is to
have summer courses and fintsh off these
subjects for sometlTnes one such subject might
be very Important for another subject which
IS to follow tn the next semester.
Not always, not all departments, come to
our rebcue when It comes to choostng electIVes
and proJects. The departments should take
steps to adVise everyone III terms of usefulness
of the project or elective for the future and
should also help m a lot of mter-departmental
programmes In subjects hke Nuclear engloeer109 etC. where the help of other departments
is reqUIred, and also help the students in
arrangmg for traIning m firms outSide.
The meetIng then concluded WIth a brief
introductIon to the nature of the variouS
commIttees for the Carmval which 18 to be
held ID January and to the staff members
co opted to these committees. We expect
more development on the suggestIOns after
the subsequent Steermg Committee meetings.

UP FOR aRAB
BY

N. PRASAD
Bemg, as we are often harangued, an Instltute of National Importance, lIT Madras
has certaln pecuhantles that set It apart
from the other CIty colleges. Our academiC
schedule, what WIth pertodlcals, tutorials,
labs and the rest of It, IS certamly a lot
more stnngent and demandmg than that 10
any of our neIghbours at the UmversJty.
Even
for
a
mmumum-marks-throughmtmmum-work-go-getter e.g. myself, three
hours of preparation for a penodlcal IS the
'average minimum for SUrvIVal. To go below
thiS would be to venture mto hazardous
territory.
C,)upled With thiS IS the fact that we have
more extra-currlcular activities here than
anywhere else In the Clty.
Our annual
Gymkhana budget IS more than twenty ttmes
that of the average CIty college. It would
not be IllogIcal to conclude that we spend a
lot more time m activIties outSide the curriculum than our counterparts from 'Without.
How are we to rel.Onclle these two fundamental aspects of campus ltfe? Sacnfictng
one for the other would be unthmkabl e. Nor
are we Neltzschean supermen to manufacture
tIme and help ourselves generously to both.
What IS the solution ~ We turn to them.
What, we ask, IS the concept? The chanot
rolls.
Back comes the reply m a dust-cart. You,
They say, are here to study. Your extracurncular actlVltles must remam, as the
name ImpItes, extra-curncular. Better stu I
cut them out completely. Only then can
you hope to become a good Engineer, InCldentally, I notice you have been absentmg
yourself ••..
No, the solution does not he With them.
Dead men tell no tales, In fact, there IS no
solutIOn. ThiS Irreconclhablltty dogs the
student nght through hiS stay here. It
hangs hke a vulture over the frustrated
Gymkhana Secretary, ready to swoop. Even
in the sports field, It has taken Its roI/.
Under these conditions, lampus life IS a
mad, frenZIed, headlong rush through each
semester With everything up for grab organlzatlon? You must be kiddmg. Come With
me and I WIll show you.
The place: AdmlmstratlVe Block, Cash
SectIOn. The tIme: 10-00 a.m. A long
queue, consIsting of students walttng for thelr
scholarShIp money, the odd sports capt am
waltmg for a temporary advance to buy
sportmg equipment etc., has already formed
at the counter and these guys have cut class
to be there.
