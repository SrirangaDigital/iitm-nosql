ability to Judge the direction of
the ball when the stroke IS made: it
IS largely mtutlve.
PNV: What was m your opimon your best
spell In the last series?
SV : There were 2 spclls; one at Lord's:
one at the Oval; people might call
the Lord's one better as I got more
wickets.
But a bowler doesn't bowl better
because he gets more wickets.
Many people forget that.
PNV : What was your best Inmngs!
SV
: The one agamst Glamorgan ; I really
enjoyed myself that day.
PNV : Your best cateh?
SV
: The one I caught Luckhurst. It
wasn't an edge at all but a stroke and
I saw the catch all the way. It
wouldn't have looked sensatIOnal in
a photograph but beheve me It was
hot.
PNV : What is Special about Prasanna's
bowling?
SV
: Pras relies more on flight; doesn't
spm It that much.
PNV : Bedl's?
: Flight of course.
SV
PNV : Chandrasekhar's?
: He relies on the mcommg ball. His
SV
pace IS dlsconcertmg even to top
batsmen and he gets DIp and bounce
all the tIme.
PNV : What IS the secret behind the
Gavaskar bombshell I
: Concentration; absolutely; of CoUIse
SV
technique also.
PNV : Your assoCiation with Pataudi?
SV
: Well, he was a complete man.
PNV . What are your ImpressIOns about the
West Indian tour 1
SV
: The West Indies batting was as good
as ever; Davies and LeWIS from
Jamaica were there to replace Butcher
and Nurse.
But their bowlmg was
suspect. Gibbs wasn't at hiS best
and Without Hall or Griffith thelf
fast bowling their main strength was
not intImidating. Our batsmen caPltahsed on this.
PNV : What about the crowds there?
SV
: Capacity crowds wherever we went.
The grounds there hold only around
20,000.

SMAU MAN ON CAMPUS
What I sez is, there oughter be a law I
Now why IS It that only the big men on
campus should be mtervlewed by the millIOns
of Campastlmes? Why doesn't someone
mtervlew one of the great unwashed? LI'.
ole me, for mstance. Hele I am, waiting,
absolutely waltmg you know, With snappy
replies and neat npostes and there IS not a
solitary soul to interview me. But I am
gOing to fool you aU. I am gOing to mtervlew
myself. So there L Th.at'll serve you rIght.
Here I go:

Q. What do you think of the present

system of electIOns to the Gymkhana ?
1 It's not the system I object
to. It's the misuse of the system that
I am against. You see, qUite a few
of the guys make a habit of not
voting for the hostel electIOns. What
you ought to do IS gIVe something
extra for tea for those who vote.
ThiS should ensure that the elections
are fair. Personally, I'd always welcome
somethmg extra for tea. As far as
the elections of the Institute Secretanes
go, the methods used are all outdated.
What we should have IS an emplf1cal
expressIon for popularity. I suggest
purely on the baSIS of personal observation that a system of pomts based on
the formula m 2 Cos (] I"'Â· N X P X d
where m IS the length of a candidate's
moustache m centImetres and (} the
angle of depreSSIOn or droop of said
moustaches With respect to the honzontal. N IS the number of dames
the candidate knows m Sarayu and
P IS the probability that he/she/It will
be able to open the sWlmmmg pool.
0u IS a quantity called the coeffiCient
of unpopulanty, measured 10 terms of
the number ot people who Wish the
candidate were dead and that looks
could kill.

Q. Are you going to fight the Establishment ~
A. Certainly. Everybody talks of fighting
the Establishment. I'm not gomg to
be left out of a good fight! The
Gymkhana hasn't got teeth, as thmgs
stand I am growmg my fingernails.
Q. Have you any changes to propose as far
as the Exammatlon system I;> concerned?
A. Yes of course' Why should only the
students have PI!C1odlcals? Let the
staff have them too. We don't want
to deny them these little thmgs, do
we? And besides, there are so many
lecturers whom I want to see answermg
some of their own papers I
Q. What about staff~student relationships
10 lIT?
A. Theyare purely platonic. You have
nothing to worry about.

(Winter 1971
Q. Do you think more girls should be
adIDltted mto the lIT?
A. Boy, oh boy! I shore do I But
purely on the basis of good looks.
Q. How d(l you think the captams of
various games should be appomted ?
A. The feller whose ears stick out the
most should be appomted captain.
Se010nty IS another cntenon. Merit
has absolutely no placc. OtherWIse,
how the hell are so many of us
going to get to Bombay ?
Q. Are you a peSSimist or an optimist?
A. Some people l.a11 me a peSSimIst and
others an optImIst. But most people call
me somethmg else. I don't know what
exactly It means, but I think It's a
dirty word.
Q. D' you trunk we'll WJn the Meet this
year?
A. I thmk we wiIl. If we don't It won't
be my fault. The PTI's are lazy.
The tracks SUltS don't fit us properly.
And the deer are makmg a mess of the
grounds.
Q. Didn't you make any election promises?
A. Now I don't promise nobody nothmg,
see?
Q. Do you thmk that If there are two
candidates, one be elected on the
basIs of the toss of a COlD?
A. I don't approve of It. It leaves too
mucn to chance. I don't have a COlO
with two heads on me.
Q. What are you gomg to do about relationsrups With other colleges?
A. Well, I was there at the Stella fete
last year. I saw qUIte a few guys
establishing close personal relationships
With (er) representatives of other
colleges. I lfltend puttmg out the
lights at the carmval. It would be a
big scream, don't you think ?
Q. Why did you stand?
A. I got tired of slttmg.
Q. Don't you think the musIc room looks
dirty?
A. Yes, I Wish someone would sweep It
everyday. We could have new curtams
too.

A. First of all I'm gomg to bum a fag.
Then I propose to hght It and blow
smoke flngs.
Q. What was your first reaction when you
heard you'd been elected?
A. I was ternbly embarassed. You see,
the feller Just charged 1Oto my room
and I didn't have my pants on !
Q. What IS your message to Campastl71Jes?
A. Bridge the gap between staff and
students. Don't bndge the gap on the
last page. Enclose the key along with
the coded edltonal. That IS about all.
