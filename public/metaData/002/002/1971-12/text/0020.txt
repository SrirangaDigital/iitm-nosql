tIhe Plog's The Thing'
-HAMLET
The confirmed rubber bridge player IS
satisfied when he makes his contract. At a
certam stage he spreads the hand and claims
the number of tncks he needs. This IS bad
strategy In duplicate where over-tricks are
Vital. There IS no law agamst wlIlning overtncks In rubber brIdge. I am With you III
your aversion to the player who goes Into a
long huddle thlnkmg up some naive strategem
to wm a doubtful overtnck, while hiS opponents walt m agony. But you will not only
enJoy your game more bUt also Improve It If
you use deals where your contract IS Impregnable to develop the habit of countmg
and to experiment With advanced plays like
the squeeze. I dlshke the practice In many
dubs of the defence concedmg a contract
qUite early In the play. The culpnt IS usually
a stalwart who holds part scores m contempt,
enjoys the game only when he holds a bIg
hand and lacks the ImagmatlOn to see that
when' hiS hand IS a bust and the opponent's
blddmg moderate, hiS partner must hold the
balance of strength. But I am dlgressmg.

finesse, East ducked once but took the
contmuatlOn.
East dId not return a heart. As It IS one
of the Crimes of bndge not to return partner's
SUit, South rightly concluded that East had no
heart left. East led the queen of diamonds,
covered WIth the kmg and won WIth the ace.
East won the diamond return and contmued
the SUIt. Declarer won WIth the ten, West
discarded a heart and dummy a club.
At thiS stage the ordmary player Will claIm
mne tncks, but the good player will c1aun
all eleven.
A spade contmuation glves him a complete
picture of the East-West hands' West, 2
spades, SlX hearts, 2 diamonds and 3 clubs;
East, 3 spades, 1 heart, 5 diamonds and 4
clubs. When the spades are run. West must
guard hiS hearts, East hIS diamonds. So
nt.lther of them can guard the clubs. See
how It works. Four spades and the heart ace
are played from the dummy, leadmg to thiS
positIon.

The last spade IS now led. East retains
his diamonds and discards a club. So
dummy'S dIamond IS dIscarded. West must
retam the heart, so he also dIscards a club.
Declarer now wms all three club tricks.
Hasty play to the first tnck IS one of the
bad habIts a player must outgrow. Simon
recommends your gomg fito a trance at tnck
one, and SImon IS always fight. If your
trance annoys your opponents, remember that
In 1954 at the World ChampIOnship at Monte
Carlo, a French player took so long that one
of hIS Amencan opponents famted and had
to be reVived WIth smelhng salts I In the
deal below, If the declarer had paused for
reflectIOn on the openmg lead, he would
not have made the automatic play that
proved fatal,

West led the five of spades, the declarer
automatically played low from dummy, East
took the lung, and removed the ace. The
declarer entered hiS hand with the diamond
kmg and led a club. West won the tnck With
the ace and played the queen of spades and
another spade. DeClarer now went down.
The declarer's play to the first trick was
thoughtless. Whatever the spade holdmg
wl1h West-four or five to the klllg and
queen, or four or five to the kmg or queenthe declarer had a second stopper III the suit,
so he gamed nothlOg by holdmg up On the
other hand, If East held doubleton kmg or
queen as was most hkely, he had everything
to gam by playmg the ace.
Declarer should see that hiS contrac.t depended on developmg the club Slllt. Only a
novice would thmk of a favourable break In
diamonds and a favourable finesse III hearts.
The odds are for the club honours to be
spht. Both honours with West poses no
problem for the declarer. Both honours
could be With East, even then the declarer
could hope for a ten doubleton With West.
Now you can see how the hold-up on the first
trIck IS fatal.
The correct play l~ ,for the declarer to WID
the first trIck with the ace, place the ace of
dIamonds, a diamond to the ktng and lead a
club. The closed hand should be entered a
second time With the ace to lead another club.
ThIS play fads only If East holds the ace
and kmg of clubs and West K Q 9 x of
spades. The odds are very much against
such a dlstnbutlon of the black SUitS.
