Of course, as would be ('xpected, the reactIOns were mixed. One saw one sports
secretary tearmg Ius hair and promlsmg dl~e
thmgs at the Gymkhana meet mg. Some with
more control, like thiS wnter, took It stOically.
Ckukku clapped hiS hands to hiS SIdes and
went IIlto paroxysms of laughter. Complamts
were lodged and plans were made. The
authonues Itstened With dreadful patience
and did precisely what was expected of
them-nothing I
In recent years, one has noticed that the
battle of the Schroeter has taken somewhat
ugly turns. Last year, we had ostracIsm of
one over-enthusiastiC hostel and beSides that
one of the most dl'graceful exrubltlons of
poor sportsmanshIp ever on the Cricket fieldfIom one who should have known better.
But that the big wigs have Jomed the fray IS
what Jolts one And how I To actually Win
the blasted thmg by depnvlng aU the other
hostels of whatever talent that IS due to them
iltnk.es one as a bIzarre method a~ far as
getting any satisfactiOn ill the process IS
concerned.
The tragedy of It all is that some other
hostels have thought fit to follow SUIt How

precIOUS few they he-In one hostel' How IS
Lt that so many of the other hostels are given
only materIa!, of which one Imagmes, future
gnnders--out of tutonals and periodicals are
made' Head$ have been wagged and tongues
have been raised by some agalllst the conglomeration of the bright young fish, but let
those who complalll, watch their own backyards and sweep them clean too. One may
have all the stOICism of a Jeeves, but things
.of thIS ug\y cahbre have been gOJng on and
gOing on too often and fast for any further
nose-In-the alT mdilference. The battle has
always aroused enthUSiasm and In many cases
stIrred up feelings and tempers, but let us
beware lest thiS sOrt of thmg should go 00 to
the extent when the VICtimized hostel, should
lose all theIr mterest m the wave of disgust
that anses.

Tnls 'unwashed' busmess has gone far
enough to btan gettmg on one's nerves. Last
year, we had quite a lot of It, and Just when
we had heaved a SIgh of rehef when the

Board, here we go agam' The unfortunate
part of th~ whole thlOg IS that we really know
who the 'wa..hed' (mea are and consequently
what they claim to be If their supenonty
consIsts III appendmg theIr name to any crap
that IS printed m thiS rag, then we laugh If
on the other hand, It COnsists of a certain
gartsh mode of attire coupled WIth a suggestIve IIldulatwn at a certain type of musIc and
a capacIty to do the prescnbld thmgs after
a certam nocturnal seSSion, thcn let us be the

nor of sCIssors would persuade us to become

To some of us It IS not clear as to what
Gymkhana IS and what It does (of course, we
rule out the' fact' that It fS what It does) and
are thus IOc1!ned to belIeve that It has nLlther
a body to be kIcked nor a soul to be damned.
And to those clever ones who happen to
fool around HSB dunng those ntghts ..•
Gymkhana does make sense. . . at least till
the 'Fanta' m the bottle IS dramed off . . .

domg 1 You seem to have swallowed It now
. . It sttlv{'s to meet all the extra-currIcular
(SOCial and cultural) r~qUlrement of aU of
us .•.
Of late, It has been made categOrIcally clear
as to what relation IS eXIsting and should eXIst
between the authOfltIes (by which It IS meant
the admmlstratlOn) and the faculty and the
students • . . Tills IS definitely an exercise In
public relatIOns . . . They Curse the tutors
for the grades they gave them and the
adminIstratIon IS the target If perIodicals are
not postponed . , . I would be darned If
they know that theIr approach to the problem
15 wrong . . . (tWice over, that IS t )
Well, the doubts beIng what they are,
(fllndamcntal I) It would be wise enough to
realise that mter-dependence alone can keep
us movmg . . . and III good humour too ...
1t IS enough to know that ditchIng a penodlcal
needs much less effort than goofing m an
entertainment.

LIVE MAN, LIVE!
What a lovely feeling,
There 1S In hvmg
That I used to Wish
Could hve forever.
But then tOnight
I changed my mmd
For that I felt
would be tiresome.
SO NOW
I would much rather
Live all the time.
