The Semmar on the rIce processmg mdustry
in India, recently hdd In the campus was
characterised by a smgular lack of purposeful
display of relevant detaJ!s regardmg the above
subject When one would expect the stress
to be placed on the actual prOcessIng of £Ice
and the nearby bran, after the production
stage exhIbited were the mynad hlgh-Yleldmg
crop;, a lot of agncultural jargon (very unpleasant) and a few plantams.

Noone knows what exactly a local neWSpaper meant, when m one of Its IDslpld
edllonals It c1alffied that the aIm of the SIXday mter-reglonal semmar was to educate the
masses on the utlhsatlOn of rice In fields
hItherto unexplolted In thIs country. An
awakenmg in short We feel that It can lay
c1auns to no such thmg when the only people
attending the seminar were those already in
thIs field and who may be expected to know
what It IS all about. The general pubhc was
left to read the meagre and poor reportmg m
the newspapers.
Quotmg from one of the many brochures
handed out • RIce IS well-known
.
SandWIched between the outer husu and the
mner gram IS a golden-brown cuticle called
bran which contams 180'0011. WIth rice production estimated at JO mIllion tons, the
potential avauabllity of bran IS 3 mllhon
tons.'
Really the Semmar was not necessary as it
dtd not serve Its purpose. A few carefully
prepared pamphlets stating facts m an interestmg manner would have done the Job
better.

Speed-breaker breaker :
One must congratulate Mr. Vinod BhatIa,
the general Secretary on the very tactful
manner In whIch he moved the authOrities to
do somethmg about the speed-breakers thIS
SIde of Gajendra Circle compromlsmg neither
pnnclples nor people m the bargam. It goes
to show that the estabhshment IS not all that
deaf to our gnevances, and only some enterprISe IS needed to get thmgs done m the
campus.
Out-door-Club:
The out-door-club has the advantage of
bemg the least talked about wmg of the
Gymkhana. It has had the good fortune not
to have to deal with anyone higherup m
the matter of Its workmg and Its performance If not spectacular, IS at lea.t satisfactory,
wluch IS saymg much for an orgamsatlon of
ItS kind m the lIT. Its activIties are rarely
made public. The mterested few can do
much better WIthout any mterference that
way The membershIp to thIS club IS nghtly
ltmlted to about 30 guys. The Secretary
Ranga and the Treasurer Jacob John are
trymg hard to convert It Into a full eqUIpped
outfit, worthy of Its name.

Literary activities:
I Hotch-potch' or not.
I was there, many
people were there, judges were there, WIth
partIcIpants SIX or seven or eIght, may be
less.

CAMPASTIMES

The three mythIcal monkeys personIfy the
tIme-work adage • see no evtl, hear no eVIl,
speak no eVIl'. However, It IS old saw noW,
best left to the treasure book of AphoTisms.
New maxIms are In vogue to-day. • The old
order changeth YIeldIng to the New'. We
are beset to-day WIth a surtiet of bold mnovatlOns and epoch makmg mventlons, platitudes
galore and a total rejection of the past.
You are hard put to refurbIsh your knowledge of the thmg~ In vogue. The womans'
library IS home to roost (mmd you no mlSogymlst me '). Hemhnes arc flu ctuatmg
among, ~axI, mIdi and mIDI. Hot pants are
the current ragt'. Neckllllc have drooped
shockingly low. Dusty, weather beaten apparel are the •In' thmg. MUSIC come In only
two categories to-day-Rock and soul.
Currently, there IS a craze m the contment
for gaudy pearl necklaces and Indian intuitive
techmques and so on. CosmopolItan groups
gather around the exotiC ma~tet to practice
• transcendental medItation' and from time to
time utter the magIC syllable • our'. MIllions
of fans converge at • Woodstock' for 3 days
of • mUSIC, love, peace'. New words are ID
fashIOn. It IS old hat • to be thrilled' • beyond all bounds' by the fashIOn show. The
mod can't would put It more succinctly as
• It got me where I ltve'. What With flood
of books m the market, It IS a mighty tricky
busmess selectmg the books that go With the
hmes. A rounded human bemg In the present sense ImplJes an mdlvldual well eqUipped
WIth knowledge of current affalTs.
Student campuses of to-day present a dlSheartemng picture. Slogans such as • bookshare stupefymg' and • study IS opIUm'
scnbbled on UnIversity walls, are a sad
reflection of the unpovenshed atmosphere
prevalent to-day.
Avant garde reformers and orgamsatlOns
have c\utled every field espousmg some
bIzane cause. We have a lot of ghb talk from
• self styl~d' SOCialists under Ilk who set'k
a 'moral and philosophIcal synthesl~ beyond
hberahsm '. They are comm!ted to the real
needs of the people'. The whole affaIr gives
you a queasy feeltng. As one dlstmgulshed
Journahst remarked 'commitment IS a duty
word'. Of late, It has acqUired ugly connotatIons. It IS however, a faVOUrite of Indian
leaders. We, espeCially m IndIa, dehght In
the negative approach to all matters. We are
an • antJ-capltabst ' country, wedded to • nonaltgnment '. As such, we strIctly adhere to
the pohcy of • non-mterference m the mternal
affaIrs' of other countrIes. We are strongly
• antl-aparthled '
• antl-parochlaltsm ' and
• anti-monopoly'. ThIS Ideology of consIstent
negation goes hand In hand WIth a remarkable
mablhty to formulate alternative proposals.
There IS a spate of pep talk regarding peace,
brotherhood and mternatlOnal understand mg.
You understand there IS a growmg prochlvlty
towards a world government. Warrmg
countnes meet III cordIal and comradely spirit
for an anunated dISCUSSion to Iron out their

differences.
reveals • depth of mutual understanding and
identity of mterests '. Anyone can smell the
phony beyond thiS diplomatIC facade and the
exqUIsite fnUs.
The puzzhng new trends, the ugly mamfestatlOns have caused a turmoil as colourful and
centreless as an old battlefield patntlng. It
makes the Scene difficult to understand. The
same apphes to the accompanying rhetOriC.
It helpld Itself to the arsenal of IdeologIes,
then altered, mIxed and parodIed these.
Protest was not seldem the accomphce of
these dlstorslOns. We have a plethora of
blzane causes that prohferate and then fade
away hke soap bubbles m lather. The outward re~pectablllty IS an effe"tlve veneer that
conceals the squalor Just as the pure whIte
foam hides the dirt beneath. Minor Issues
are pIa) ed up out of context, fed WIth a lot
of emotion and It becomes a blockbuster of
a controversy. People today have become
IncrcaslIlgly partisan and theIr respectIve
stands unassailable.
They prejudge every

issue. RIgmarole IS confused With reasoning.
Assertions are sought to clock facts. Plautudes are but poor substttutes for solutIOns.
Utopia, even as you mIght cherish It, 18 not
realIty, however dIStasteful It be.

NIGHT
The moon In shame
HIdes behmd
A shrowd of clouds
But cunoslty
Overwhelms the breeze
As I tWIst
On a bed
Stamed WIth a thousand sins
Of vlcanous pleasures
In plpedreams sttll-born.
And for thIS
The dog laments.

Oh I Won't I be glad

(To name but a few of the coveR I)
had!
Thmgs were qUIte SImple then
And the land was of happy men
The world was flat
God was great
And that wj\s that I
Thunder was Just a wonder
Atom'> weren't splIt asunder
In fact,
No one new
The colour, texture and gender
Of atOms and molecules
And many more of theIr • Kmder '
which now make us all fools.
Things were at a stand-still
Includmg the earth
You could eat your fill
And rest before the hearth
The sun, at God's behest
Was movIng, Without rest
To make the nIghts and days
There was only one bother
You couldn't go much farther
Beyond the edge of the world
But thIS too didn't hurt
For a bullock cart
Would need the better part
Of a Jahr-hundert
To take you to the edge of the world
And so,
Why shouldn't I deSire
To be addressed' My Sire! '
By the vassals m my hive
As I don my ferrum dress
To rescue damsels tn dIstress.

MEMORIES
The tender memones
Of warm sunny days
Under a bemgn sun:
Milltons of \\ords
Unspoken
In the years of passion
Conveyed In a moment
Of tender madness.
And the catharSIS
When as we tumbled
We rose
To the heIghts of blIss.
The pale autumn even
When the Sun bid farewell
Your presence.
The warmth, the fragrance
Of a mllhon flowers
Eager to bloom
But to wither soon.
I stdl remember you. -A. SANKARAN.
