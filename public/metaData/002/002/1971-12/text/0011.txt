AUTO TYPE

ACase Against
the
Great Unwashed
Chic, as V mny pomts out, IS a "ymho! of degeneration. There are vanous kmd~ of ChIc.
In the IlTlan context. there are the guys who
swank around, others who h;ne read people
hke Rand, Sartre, Maller or l\1arx. There are
more of these cool cats who are bowled over
by hard rock, who patroDlse psychedehc
movies at the USIS (and blow thelf mmds),
who dISCUSS the work of Jean-Lu c Goddard
before he pronounced lumself a bourgeOIs.
not forgettmg those who find a crazy creatiVity m the M4.D magazme, and others ~ho
\Vnte modern verse In Tamil These people,
let's face II, do eXIst In a mInorIty. And then
there are the great unwashed who, by default,
have renounced all claims to ChIC.
No\\, autotype IS a form of self-flattery that
commUnltles often practIce. It IS powerful.
Whole countnes Indulge In autotype, for It IS
hypnotiC, all encompassmg, and It keeps the
community well-screened from reality. 'ReflectIOns m an unwashed eye' Was an exercise
m auto type. That It warrants an artIcle of
thIS type, an explanation of sorts, IS not necessarIly because of It$ 'thrusts of good sense',
but only because It IS so tmngly symbohc of
the defense mechanIsm of the great unwashed.
They, by defifiltlOn, accept most of the values
that have been mgramed mto them, and as a
consequence vIew new Ideas With dIstrust.
The pseudo mtellectual is their greatest
enemy he IS their only avenue to autotype,
whIch for them IS a basiC necessity Notwlthstandmg the universal acceptance of the
fact that perception and InSIght are commoditIes worthy of possessIOn, the great unwashed
preoccupy themselves WIth the rallrng of thIS
, pseudo', whenever an assault IS made on
them.
Yes, we can't afford to be even a hlllt illogical m thiS b\,smess of metaphySICS Who IS
the great unwashed and what makes him tick?
(At thIS pom! It would be nothmg less than
orgtastlc to mentIon that If 60% of the
IITlans are unwashed, the same commumty
luts lllnety per cent outside, and hence the
snob-~alue of bemg In IIT)
So, delUSIOns of
grandeur apan, what makes hIm tIck) Take
a look at the angry young man (SIC) who is
fightmg for hIS hfe, fighting agamst the values
that have been mgramed mlo hIm (by mst!tutlons lIke the famtly), eIther because they
are too archaiC and madequate (the Ten
Commandments would zap It to you where It
hmts) for hIS complex life, or they clash
radIcally WIth some new values he has stumbled upon, or he belIeves, m true Sartrean
fashion, that It IS m vam that we try to effect
the .,ynthesls of eXIstence and beIng, whIch
are basically formless. Whatever mIght be
the ca$C, one needs great loms, as Maller
would say, to get mto thIS basIC questIOn and
the first step therefore SIr, IS to questIon what
you see around you Knowledge IS a very
essentlal mgredlent of thIS process, and It IS
acqulred by lookmg around yourself In all
manner of perceptIon which Includes, among
other thmgs, readmg, hstenmg or merely
seemg.
In thiS IDstltutlonahzed world where labels
have been handed down for centunes, knowledge helps one to dlfferentlate between thmgs,
to transcend labels, and to search for the
essenCe of thmgs mcludmg oneself. Would
one prefer to carryon the 'bondage to the
machIne', or "Would one reject It? Optlng
for the latter, one would seemingly choose
cha09, by mstituttonalJzed standards, and yet
preserve one's dlgmty as a human being.
Much work has gone mto the posing of thIS
questIOn In Its present slmphfied form of
much contemporary relevance. It would be
infantile to thmk that Sartre and Marx exerclsed thur reasolllng powers Just to gIve
themselves alrs. To be aware of the Ideolo-

111

CAMPASTIMES
gles propounded by these men (and numerous
others), IS to be faced WIth a vltally Important questlon. And you don't face any questmn unless you. are aware of 1t. Thus aware·
ness .,yndrome IS bUIlt up by perceptIOn,
leadmg hopefully, to Illsight.
Havmg Itved for four-and-a-half years m
lIT, I have learnt my lesson about cymcIsm,
whIch IS only a more respectable and acceptable euphemism for dntl-mtellectualtsm.
Consldermg that the ummagmative system
reduces us to mere logs III the machIl1e, even
durmg the satlsfYIl1g process of learnmg, the
IITmn mtellectual hds to be extremely
adept at schedulmg, at actmg upto the people
around hIm, or else he IS reduced to an
academIC medIOCrIty. And suddenly when It
dawns on you that none of our ImmedIate
educators arc really aware of the SOCIal purpose ot teachIng, and so, are dlstrous feultnes, you better learn not to say It III publIc.
The prImary CrIterIon for talkmg about such
thmgs IS academIC excellence and'S' aver~ges
don't bake no crap about the system from
an academIc medIOCrIty, though hiS mSlght
lOto the workmg of the system IS deeper than,
say, that of the bigWIgS In the Admlmstratlon
Such unseasonable antI-Intellectual
autotype IS characteristIc of the great unwashed who do not feel the need to perceive. Just
as our traits one denved from our SOCIOeconomic backgrounds, our hves as students
depend to a large extent on the collectlve attitudes of the commumty. Hence any assault
on the great unwashed, albeit with mIssIOnary
zeal and fervour, I:. not entIrely unwarranted.
The questIOn which apparently bugs the
umnformed IS
What does chIC have to do
With the guest for percepHon and insIght? In
the hIstory of the thmkmg pnnclple, the Intellectuals, ahenated from the world around
them, have found It necessary to VIOlate accepted norms, molest InstitutIons and In general,
to dnve home the pomt mlhtantly. These
actIOns were pumshable by bamshment, Impnsonment and death, engineered by the
aggressIve-defensive complex of the great unwashed of those tIme~-they Sure have a long
hIstory. But modern clvlltsation has added
much sophlstIcatlon to the revolutIonary
movement. If tlte Estabhslunent defends
Itself WIth culture, rap them In the pun with
culture. ThiS attitude has forced the dISCIples of the thlnktng prmclple to evolve a
counter culture, "hlch mamfest Itself m the
form of varIOUS symbolIc protests. Long
haIr IS one, smokmg, Mother Nature IS
another. Yes, ChiC IS a product of thiS
counter-culture. It IS chaotiC, undefined and
a purely mdlvldual tnp. It has thIS cheeky
anogant kick of emanating bad VibratIOns for
the stolid com}}lacent CItizenS, who, apparently, see If as a challenge to theIr way of hfe,
and are essentially disturbed by It. WhIch
makes It r~any beautiful and worthwlle.
Such beauty and mnocence and mIlItancy
have brought about drastic changes m attitudes. It may weIl brmg In the goods.
Even lIT, Madras has ItS counter-culture.
There are a few people who want to change
thiS lllStItutlon mto a true hall of learmng,
Instead of the avenue to-upper-middle-cIasshfe whICh It IS. Many of them are confused
and troubled by what thIS IllStitutlon, through
various means, has done to them. They exhIbIt theIr anger III their chIC WhIch IS conSIdered as a symbol of degeneratIon and
mmdlessness by the great unwashed. We are
not deCIded about the revolutIOn, and if we
are, vagueness enshrouds the lllstruments.
Don't Imod. us; you have nothIng to knock
us With. It IS true that the pOSSibIlity of
hYPOCriSY under elegance eXists. And the
great unwashed are vulnerable to knowledge;
or to the pretence of knowledge. They want
to play It safe. Raze the superstructure to
the ground, they holler, because It IS only that
they see. WIth blIghted VISIon, they hIt the
pseudo-below the belt, because they are afraId
to face the real guy, whom they have no means
of IdcntIfYlllg and understand mg. I like
pseudo-llltcIlectuals they are domg a servIce
for the revolutIon whIle not behevmg m the
Cause. An A.sslstant Professor IS bugged not
because you are a pseudo, but because of hi,s
dIsapproval of the movement. ThIS IS pretty
good for a long haIr. ChIC masters all; It IS
a powerful weapon.
Let us return to the orIgInal auto type'
ReflectIons In an unwashed eye. Apart from
santmg against the external affectIOns of the
pseudo-mtellectual, It inSinuated that any dlsCUS~lOn of Maller, Marx, Rand or Just the old
EstablIshment
is an lDfantile exercise in

penanOla. The great unwashed IS under the
mIsconception that these people ate seekmg
labels. It IS mIldly IronIC that people who
are helplessly labelled and revel under such
supposedly respectable and solid tIdes hke
the SIlent MdJonty, should labour under such
a ml~concepuon. And the only avaIlable
label they can find, that fits their defimtlon,
IS that of the pseudo Intellectual. Yes, U
you get bugged by my dIscourses on Mader
and the Establishment, It IS your problem,
baby, not mme. And If you knew enough
of both, you would try your hand at provlOg
my knowledge maccurate or false, but then
the defimtlOn doesn't fit you any more.
Rock
Anyone who has read anythtng
about rock would know that IS only a movement, a statement on contemporary hfe; It
often peters off mto mmdlessness, and for any
rock fan, good taste IS a must, to separate the
heavy stuff from schlock. In IndIa It IS only
a symbol of affluence (one only has to Iwk at
the JS NatIOn), as It IS of httle relevance to
our ImmedIate enVironment, but to have
good taste m rock IS not a stigma. Anyone
who says rDck IS a conglomeration of sounds
has no respect for music, natIve or otherwlse.
Coming to the men of the rag blasting the
great unwashed, these chaps traced the ongm
of apathy and mdlfference on campus to the
smgular rejectIon of thought by the majOrIty
of the community, a lack of awareness, and.
of course, the cymcal your-crap-am't-Icecream
attllude, whIch effectIvely nullify all pOSItIVe
efforts for change. One sees the connection
propounded by Mr. George John, between the
local commumtyand the Agnewlan concept.
the Stlent MajorIty only the maJonty IS not
Silent but dumb. What, one wonders, have
the WASPs to be SIlent about. One only has
to read Maller's I ArmIes of the NIght' or
see Peter Fonda's 'Easy RIder' to get the true
pIcture of thIS twat-uckltng maJonty, sitting
before the Idiot tube, the whip of the Corporation land, and gettmg hIgh over the creatIVity
III deodorant commerCials.
Yes, the majority
IS so dumb they have to hIde under the
maJonty they make up About turning mto
an effete snob (It IS effete corps of Impudent
snobs; effete snob makes no sense) we have
to remmd the author that Mr. SpIro Agnew
referred to long haIrs and antI-war demonstrators as snobs, not to someone who 18 a
proud member of the dumb maJonty 'They
have pseudo-podIa, rIng any bells? ' Talk
about subtlety ,
'Everyone of the great unwashed reaches
a stage, where he must, by all rules, have a
hang-up, But he doesn't. If' Reflections •
IS any mdlCatlOn, the great unwashed has
more hangups than all the lynch mobs In the
history of US. And If ghbness passes for
perceptIon and mSlght, It IS only due to one's
false sense of values.
Moral
ThIS hang-up is totally unnecessary
The amusmg epIsode m the artIcle centred
around 'LIght My FIre' The saId BMOC
knew very well that the song was WrItten and
composed by the late JIm MOrrIson. This
knowledge has nothIng to do with self-respect.
When somebody uses rock metaphors and you
don't know a thmg about them, so much of
commUnlcatlOn IS shut out. Learn If you
thmk It IS worth It. Yes, to be Ignorant IS
onetbmg, and to assert your Ignorance In the
name of rIghteousness IS quite another.
Talkmg about the camp phIlosopher and
Resident Rand extollIng the VIrtues of an
egregIously medIOcre film, one must assert
at thiS point that Ayn Rand, mIsgUIded
as she was, dId not wrtte a FlImgoers'
companion; and objectIVism says nothmg
about bad taste m movIes. Ergo chiC has no
eXIstentIal borders. ThIS agam IS an attempt
at trymg to label the thtnkers and at findmg
glarmg \llCOnslstencles III the label.
Of the IIT13n play, 'The PhYSicists' staged
last year, the theatre cntlc of a local colIege
magazme had thIS much to say. Pseudointellectual IS the word thst Jumps to one'smmd on seeing the PhYSICIStS. Then she
went on to say that the actmg was lousy costumeS gansh, and accents a bit too natIve.
To state the flaws In the production is definitely a critlc's Job and one has much respect for
it. But to call us names because we chose to
do the play, Within the hmltatlons of our
talents, IS somethIng else agaIn. ObvlOusly,
what got her upnght was the fact that we
chose to do the play, lfistead of some Insh
play, WIth the brogue thrown m for gOlldwlll.
If one had the honesty to admit having mlssed
