FAWN
The short story was to be wntten on the
theme:
He saw her blue eyes droop down as she
looked at the mirror and he knew that all was
lost.

-Ed,tor.

The hosp1tal was loaded With people and
the dlsturbmg aroma of antIseptIc Everythmg
was hushed, mute and full of medlCIO II chill.
Even the huge wall-clock, white-sheathed
nurses and whlte-apwned doctors were fllttmg
In and out of whlte-wa~hed cells
Like
termItes, thought B,son, as he sat huddled In
a corner, feelmg very much lIke a white
corpuscle hImself. HospItals cllIlIed hlnl to
the marrow of h,s bones Cold, white, slabs
of marble. He wondered how Inres could be
saved lU such frigId tombs. He felt as
though somebody was Slowly stranghng him.
He wanted to roll In the sand outsIde and
gasp for the air and tfle warm -sunshme But
a chubby face swarmed mto hiS eyes. Curly
brown haIr. Those danclflg blue eyes. Fawn.
She was somewhere lOS Ide thIS vast, chilling
tomb. He would never have brought her
here. But somebody h<ld IOSlsted that he

he was knowu to be one of the best plastic
'Surgeons. Fawn was here He had to see
her, and he had to hold her pale hand before
she would be taken 10. That was at one·
thirty He looked at the clock. It showed
one-fifteen. He had to hear her babYIsh
VOIce once more, he had to assure her that
he would be there throughout. He must be
beside her now. In an agony of torment he
tWIsted hiS cuff-hnks. But the crowd to-day I
of all the three hundred and s1xty-five days
of the year, people had to choose thIS day
to flood the hospital. There was somebody
'StandIng 1U front of him. He looked up With
a start.
....
'Excuse me, do you know the way to
ward SIX?'
BIson shook hIS head rather vehemently to
show Ignoranl.e. Leave l1le alone, you beasts.
How could people be so callous and Indifferent wlule he was fairly bursting \Vlth the
msufferable pam of a martyr? Involuntanly,
he felt hIS pulse. Fawn needs me, take me
to her, you sterile fools. The stranger ambled
away to repeat the enquiry to a neighbOUrIng
man, only to get the same response. Bison
sudden'y felt a pang of sympathy for the
stranger But it was a fleetmg emotion. He
rose up and pushed hiS way towards the
receptlODist behmd the broad counter.
He had to know when he would be allowed
In
The counter was faIrly thronged With
men and women of varIOUS ages A handbag dropped to the floor near the corner
where BIson had statIOned himself for the
onslaught. He pIcked It up and handed It
to the old lady who had been too busy trymg
to get a word In at the counter to notIce Its
absence. WIth a gasp of astonishment she
~llected It from him, thanking him profusely.
He smtled mecharncally, a blt embarra,sed.
Fawn, Fawn, where are you now? wIn I
never reach you In time, dear ~ He edged
towards the counter resolutely.
'Could you tell me If I can go up to

now~'

, Just a moment, Sir.'
The young receptIOnIst was flustered with all
the people convergmg upon her. They asked
her somethmg about a medlcllle-shop.
Somebody wanted to know how effiCient the
staff was. A middle aged man askLd for a
-certam doctor With brown eyes and a tooth
missmg In the lower Jaw. Bison fumed
mwardly like a dIstraught bull IU an empty
rIng. Fa\.. n, Fawn, he screamed to hImself.
Nobody seemed to hear hIm. WdS the world

alarm at the clock.
He had ten mlUutes more. R~epttonlst,
please, plea$e, listen to me. One moment,
MISS. Look thIS way, gIrl. He pleaded to
her WIth hiS eyes. He appealed to her like a
man at the ex.ecutLon-block pleadmg for
mercy. He nllsed hIS VOice, but the words
were drowned before they were out of hiS
mouth. He tned once more.
'CQuld I go up now, miss?'
, Just a moment, Sir.'
He waIted. There was nothmg else to do.
He had to be patient, he told hImself. Curly
brown hair. Blue eyes danced before hlffi.
And the golhwog. Fawn, Fawn, I shall be
WIth you soon, Fawn. The receptlontst saId
only a moment Hold on dear Fawn. Does
the golhwog talk to you Fawn? Are you
sleepy, Fawn? Turn your head the other
way. It WIll not hurt, dear.
• You can go up now, SIr. The doctor
Will meet you at the door. Sorry for the
Inconvemenee, Sir '.
BIson felt IllS heart expand mto a mtlllOn
hectares. He hardly knew how he could
thmk or act WIthout causlOg those nearby
to paOlc. But he held himself together.
He went dashmg up the staIrs to the SIxth
floor, Tea\l2ed hiS mistake and dashed back to
the lower floor like a madman. The doctor
was not there. He had probably been called
off elsewnere. Fawn, Fawn. Bison hardly
nouced the floor or the waIls. Fawn was there
for all the world to see. He went close to her
bed and stood, breathless and floatmg With the
marvel of the Jlloment. The sheets covered
her fr311 body up to the neck She was fast
asleep, and the golhwog was nestling dose
to her cheek. BIson took off hIS hat and
went down on hiS knees. He had no Idea how
long he stayed In that position. He felt a
hand on h1s shoulder. The lIght, famlllat
hand of a man whose life was devoted to the
task of savlI1g people WIth the help of a knife
and a scalpel.
, She IS a very brave girl. She thmks a
lot of you '.
'I cannot thank you enough, doctor.
Fawn means everything, everythmg to me '.
The surgeon smIled
He patted hIm
reassunngly on hiS back and strode away.
BIson gazed reverently at the sleepIng gul.
He put h1S fingers upon her forehead. There
was a strip of SlickIng-plaster covermg her
nose. Poor kId. Who had told him about
the plastic surgeon? He could not recall the
name now. Somethlllg that sounded lIke
canary-soup or cattIe-stall. But he could
remember how he hdd Come home that fatal
summer-evenmg, and how he had found the
housemaid hysterIcal, and almost on the verge
of a breakdown. It had been an aCCIdent. Fawn
had been terribly scarred by the aCId when
she had spilled some of It on her nose In
childIsh cunoslty. Perhaps It would not have
happened If her wonderful mother had been
ahve. Perhaps It would not have happened
If he had taken suffiCient care to place the
bottle of aCId In an upper shelf. He blamed
hImself for the suffenng that Fawn went
through., and hiS mind was knotted up tn a
torment of palO as he castigated himself
repeatedly for hls folly
, Daddv, are you saYing? '
BIson blinked away hiS tears and took Fawn
mto hiS arms, beammg at her hke a clown.
Her blue eyes were twmklmg.
'No, dear. How IS that black httle
golhwog now? '
, He talks to me, Daddy. And he SlOgs
at nlght',
Father and daughter looked down at the
crumpled goI!lwog.
Fawn suddenly burst
out In a fit of giggles, and Bison began to
laugh WIth her, clutching her small frame
to himself, possessively, trymg to fan down
hIS own mner anRer at hIS c1um~lI1ess
The nurse wheeled the trolley out of the
surgery. Bison rose up hastily and followc:d
her mto the WArd. The doctor came m a
moment later. Bison looked In genUine
wonder as hIS little daughter, noW restored
and as cherubiC as she had been before.
Fawn, Fawn, you the same little thing again.

He recalled the times when he had hushed
h~r to sleep as a baby. The doctor prodded
hIm gently. He was smllmg, too.
The
golhwog was not In its usual place. How
strange, thought Bison. Then he saw the
black, ugly, playthmg 10 the hands of the
nurse. She beamed at him Bison laughed
and tenderly touched hiS daughtet's face.
Fawn woke up Instantly, yawning. The
nurse thrust the golhwog under the pillow
and hurrIed away. Blson rumpled hls daughter'S
curly brown hair.
, How are you, nut-brown boy? '
, Sad, sad, sad, said the lIttle boy'
Then both burst out III a paroxysm of
laughter. The doctor, feehng alienated, sm1led
hke a robot. The nurse came 10 WIth a
mIrror 10 her hand. She gave It to the
doctor. Fawn was stIll tlttenng hke a magpie,
her chubby hands locked together. Bison
saw her looking mto the mIrror. HE SA.W
HER BLUE EYES DROOP DOWN AS
SHE I~OOKED AT THE MIRROR, and
he knew that all was LOST.

Director's Visit to the U.S.A.
The DIrector left Madras on 15th September on an eight-week tour of the U.S A,

With Umverslty Professors and representatives

Interest.

'BELIEVE ME'
Tweedledurn was feelmg terribly bored.
The bOisterous extravagance of the mterhostel was a thmg of the past. He had seen
that structure come up from thorns to Its
precanous grandeur that rice processmg
exhibitIon. He went In. He went to a torsion
balance kept there There was a well-badged
gentleman spreadmg knowledge and TweedIe~
dum asked hun what it was. The gentleman
was most co-operative but static mechaniCS
was not obVIOusly his cuppatea. He remmded
Tweedledum of some of the lectures tha t
one got at the ~earby-Block. But Tweedledum was set on ImblblOg knowledge and
nothmg was gomg to discourage hun. ' Why
IS It called so, sIr? 'he persisted.
A sardoruc
smile enveloped the gentleman's face' He
replIed' Dh I you don't know that: It was
Invented by TorSIOn'.
Tweedledee was In a hurry. He had gone
for a delta loaf and was rushmg back to prepare
for that one-hour horror at 8-00 a m. The
mountains were not movmg from their ICY
chIlI and he was frantIcally wavtng at every
car that came Into the campus. He was m
luck. The ambassador screeched to a halt and
he got m. A gentleman was slttlng at the
back and T", eedledee could not see !urn pro~
pedy. The Conversation proceeded ' -
