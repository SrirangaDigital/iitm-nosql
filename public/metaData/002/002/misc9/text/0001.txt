FROM THE EDS.

(IS ANYBODY LISTENINGZL

'Eds may come and Eds may go
but I will go on for ever'.
- old CAMPASTIMES saving
(with due apologies to Tennyson)
So CAMPASTIMES walks on to yet another year.
a better way to describe its gait.
between supply and demand.

It is a perpetual

conflict

An economist might be intrigued with this

case,for the supply just never meets the demand !

And so year after

year each editor in a futile attempt to bridge this yawning shortfall
of articles, goads the otherwise lazy IITian to 'rediscover his hidden
talents' and come out with something creative.
We used to wonder what drove these tireless editors on this
seemingly endless hunt.

Now of course its no more a mystery for every

There is much talk of 'improving' the standard of CAMPASTIMES'
articles, and boring articles abounding, et

A common malady with a '1iterary mag' such as ours is that it
ends up remaining an exclusive preserve of a limited few.

The vast

majority merely takes a perfunctory voyage, hopping from one page to
another.

Perhaps,

the

article evincing maximum interest

is a cross-

This

simply

means that the general reader assumes it to be a

magazine filled with either mundane or esoteric articles, neither of
which

interest him.

The tendency of the

editors

to stick to a small

clique serves to further distance them from other students.

So help

us bridge this gap.
Here's

looking

forward

to an enjoyable year with you.

Happy reading.
