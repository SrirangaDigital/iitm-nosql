Let me point out that what we lose through this rule is far greater
than the measly gain of a slightly

standard.

what is now lost is the trust that had been reposed in the

management will now be perceived as being on opposite sides of the

From this will develop a mentality of competition, of cold war,
where the aim will be to get as much as possible from the other while
yielding as little as possible.

In fact, I have a feeling that the

overall percentage of classes attended may actually come down as
people attempt to exactly fulfill the minimum requirement.
