The box flew

Before she could react, a wave

gently engulfed the box in its reaches and retreated with it into
the fathomless depths of the ocean.

They are now happily married and have two kids, but she

1:

Assume the array to he a 10 x 10 chess board.

will now consist of one black and one white square.

An adjacent pair
If you make the

first square white, then the

100th square will also be white (check

with your 8 x 8 chess bo’rd).

Removing those two squares leaves us

with two black squares which cannot be paired.
2.

You can be at any spot on a circle which is

10 km away from a

point on earth where the circumference
is

10 km

point

1.e.,

(say A)

if you start
and reach B

from this

(10 km south)

and move 10 km east from B. it would
take you

round the earth back to B;

and

10 km north will lead you to A.
You can also

start

from a spot

so near

the south pole that it would take you round
the earth twice.

of course this generalizes

to eastern trips that qo n times round the
pole; so the problem is solved by an infinity of spots on an infinity
of circles.
