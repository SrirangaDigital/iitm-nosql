and some come out into the

When approached too close, it

The Openbilled stork is a large black and white
waterbird, somewhat resembling a vulture in
flight.

It can be seen overhead in large

groups, in the evenings and mornings.

A colony

of around 300 birds lives in IIT, and goes out
to feed elsewhere, everyday.

These birds can

be observed in their nests, at close quarters,
from the top of SAC.

The Openbill gets its

name from the gap between its mandibles,

which

is present even when the beak is closed.

What

exactly this gap is for, no one knows.

The whitebreasted Waterhen is heard
more often than it is seen.

It is

noisy in the rainy season and makes
a metallic krrâ€”kwak, krr-kwak......
noise, which has been likened to the
sound made by a hear when skinned
alive.

In appearance it is grey,

with white face and breast and
a bright red patch under the tail.
It

can be

wading

seen during

in water-logged

the monsoon,
areas.

Its

relative, the Indian Moorhen, is similar in appearance and can be seen
at our lake.
