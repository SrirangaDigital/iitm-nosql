§§§
HELLO

It's a burning burning flame
That's driving me crazy and act silly
the person to blame
is one heluva charming filly.
She's lovely with features feline
In her, beauty is in its prime
want to know her better and make mine
What all I ask is gimme some time.
Her hand I wish to claim
And to the world I hereby proclaim
It's a sham that's what is society
In it what you need is a Godfather strong
with you if you have someone mighty
Then you can get away with any wrong.

That's why I crave not for pseudo fame
Nor care for shame
I'll be happy so long as I have my dame
but only if I could know her name.
