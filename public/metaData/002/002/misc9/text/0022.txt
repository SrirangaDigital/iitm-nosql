A flash of REVELATION shook her as she realised all her caring for
the poor, her feelings of the social equality of man etc. were but
a mere covering, a facade to cover the real Sheela who now stood
exposed.

§§§
A CAGED BIRD
Four walls
a roof and a floor —
this is my domain.
I am caged by my ambition.
'Priorities' says one
'Compromise' says another;
My soul cries
in indignation at the price demanded
for what little given.
Status and money Words of little promise
hold me in no lure now.

But I have
one consolation The window.
I look out of it:
at the greenery
at the stars
at my love, Nature.
So I continue
facing the window
paying the rent.

P. Seshu
