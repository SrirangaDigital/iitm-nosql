humanity.

And the State he served was suppressing that natural love

of man for man from taking root and in that lay the basic,tragic flaw.
A flaw that has caused needless spillage of human blood, the
cultivation of hatred in young and old for the colour of other men's
skins.
and man.

Apartheid has perpetrated the worst ever divide between man
And its victims ...
. . Van Dyke looked at the two black

kids holding his hands

and then remembered the faces of his own David

and Sylvia......
Tender victim of apartheid
Don't you ever ask them why.
If they tell you will cry
Just look at them and sigh.
Well just

sighing would achieve nothing.

Every sane white Van

Dyke realised,must bring it to bear on the others the necessity to
mend all that was wrong, so that S.A. could be a society where there
would be no need to

sigh,looking at the

innocent

faces of the

generations born today and those yet to come.
