THE MAYOR 0F CASTERERIDGE — REWRITTEN

Thomas Hardy's original novel was a gloomy and emotional version
of

the Mayor's

story.

He,

like most novelists

of the period was

hell

bent on proving that Mayors, like all other human beings only came on
earth to go about being a) terrifying

b) morbid and c) nuts.

The story begins with the hero Michael Henchard and his wife
Susan eating porridge at a fair.

Their baby Elizabeth (we'll call

her Liz for short, though 'Liz for short' is as long as 'Elizabeth')
also wants some, but as

the porridge contains rum (and Daddy is

Very firm about his daughter's morals, whatever his own may be)

she

goes hungry, while drunk Henchard gets the bright idea of selling his
wife to make some money.

His theory is - there are wives and wives

but who‘ll part with good money?

the wife.

becomes Mayor.

Don't ask howl Meanwhile he also has an affair with

a beautiful girl named Lucetta who belongs to another town.

Enter Henchard's wife

and grown up daughter, who decide to sponge on the Mayor as the sailor
is missing.
with the predictability of a Hindi movie Farfrae falls in love
with Liz but (and here's the twist) marries Henchard's girlfriend
Lucetta (the morals of those degenerate daysl).

To

twist the tale

further Susan dies and Farfrae divorces Henchard (oops resigns from
Henchard's factory) and Liz becomes Lucetta's friend and lives in
her house, with Farfrae as her ex lover getting more embarassed by
the minute.
And then it turns out that Liz is not Henchard's daughter but
the sailor's and then Henchard goes broke and the sailor comes back
(now that
