Summer game
All thIs "SUmmer you taught lilt:how to unwInd myself
(I had known no other summer),
how to learn to love nature,
Lo apprecIate musIc and tImelessness.
In thIs process of reformatIonI learnt sImple pleasures to fill my empty soul
1 forgot my loneilness and followed your shadow.
ObhvJOus of your ego and IDtenttons,
1 lost my will and reason
When summer sought Its end,
I realized SUJllll1er was the shortest season
How many times I had told lIIyself 1 love him
All I needed from you was a single gesture of
comprehension.
