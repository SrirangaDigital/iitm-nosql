Pointers to the
Placement Section

Flowers Never Bend
with the Rainfall ....

(I) Time and again pleas have been made for the
appomtment of a full·tIme Placement Officer but these hwe
vlelded no results so far A very strong plea was made by
Mr V Ramaknshnan, the outgomg Alumm Secretary, on
the Alumm Day, m view of the conditIOns m the Placement
Office last semester Due to lack of staff, the show was run
almost entIrely by students (at a cost for many of them m
terms of classes, perIodicals etc) The administration as
usual was slow m reactmg to the situation.
I don't thmk I need to go agam mto the reasons for this
demand It has been repeated too many tImes rIght from
Bhatia's days and by now, I'm sure everyone IS familiar wIth
them. What we need IS the appoIntment of a fuH·tlme
Placement Officer at least of the rank of an Assistant Profes·
sor He could work under the gUIdance of a semor Profes·
sor ID the InstItute HIS duties apart from Placement could
be lIaison work for the Institute now that the ICC has been
establIshed Such a person would also be a formal channel
of feedback from the Industry as to their requIrements
relatmg to the outputs of the Institute (VIZ. Engmeers and
Consultancy Services) Needless to say, such a feedback IS
absolutely necessary This feedback will help us modify our
programmes to SUIt the needs of Industry ThiS person
coultl be deSignated PublIc RelatIOns Officer or Industnal
LiaIson Officer or Placement Officer. Of course, thiS aspect
doesn't concern us very much as long as we have someone
In the Placement Office
(II) I thInk we students would greatly appreciate It If the
departments could lend a helpmg hand ID the placement
process Up.to·date the Management Department IS the
only one which has placed everyone of Its students, and to a
certam extent, the Aeronautical Engmeenng Department too

ments and the staff to place at least some of thelT students
Also, thiS personal mterest on the part of the staff of the
welfare of the students would go a long way ID strengthen·

It began as stones often do-once upon a time (when I
was young and handsome), I floated on a WISpy cloud of
cotton· candy, lookmg down upon the world WIth rose·
coloured spectacles I knew that the world was pmk, so the
spectacles weren't really necessary but I never bothered to
take them off-they were rather comfortable You feelIng
hungry brother? Help yourself to cotton·candy, SIt back,
relax Dream of castles tn the air, never·never land and, of
course, faIry pnncesses (Ms's please read faIry prmces.)
How does It feel to lose one's faith? I fell into a bottomless well, a yawmng chasm that gaped suddenly before me,
I grappled With the blackness that IDvaded me from wlthm
and Without-but m vam It filled me and spilled over mto
my mouth leavmg behlDd a taste of old shoes and rain·
water. Endlessly I fell, spmnmg towards nothmg SIlence
-a rlOgmg, terrIble SIlence shrIeked at me and I had nothmg
in me to fight With. Slowly 1 came to rest and as the !Jght
slowly broke in the darkness I saw a desolate waste IDstead
of the comfortable secunty of cotton-candy clouds.
Pretty words strung together meaning nothmg in
particular.
When someone, whom you respect and look up to, lets
you down-then that ranks as the biggest betrayal of them
all Judas, you alD't seen nothlDg yet
Look around son, and watch the way the world walks
Walk WIth It, It's eaSIer to swim WIth the stream. It's not
tIme to make a change-relax and take It slowly , I don't
want to walk barefoot in the mud or sleep in the raID
CharlIe so I'm off the ClDcinattI to carve myself a Dlche
m high 'socIety-and the rest of you be damned' 'Let us
mark thiS a festIve occaSIOn, my frIends; and dignify It WIth
speeches Let us go forth and Win laurels for thiS mstltute,
dressed up and gilded as men and quakmg at the emptiness
InSide.'
Quote: 'Well I'm all for leaving and that being done,
I've put ID a request to take up my turn m that forsaken
paradise that calls Itself" Hell" -where no one has nothmg
and nothmg IS well, meaning, fool, pick up thy bed and nse
up from your gloom smlhng,
GIve me your hate and do as the 10vIDg heathen do.'
Walkmg the city streets at nIght, I came upon a pavement
flower seller She sat beneath the mercury lamp, the better
to display her pItIful wares-the small pile of flowers faded
and choked by the fumes of the traffic that thundered by.
Her face was a mask of ellhaustlOn and-reSignation. What

touched my heart was the bundle of cloth beside-her; a
child sleepmg trustmgly on the pavement-trustlDg ID this
country to prOVide her With a future. The VIsion filled :my
braID and as I walked I sought desperately for an answer;
trywg to assuage my gUIlt for bemg what I am? I don't
know Confu<lon
Then suddenly I saw the solution plain before my eyes-a
banner across the road-Welcome to Prime MlOister.
Quote again: ' The mirror on my wall
Casts an Image dark and small
But I'm not sure at all It'S my reflection
And I'm blInded by the hght,
Of God and Truth and Right
And I wander through the night WIthout
direction
So I'll contlOue to continue to pretend
My hfe wIll never end,
And flowers never bend with the rainfall.'
