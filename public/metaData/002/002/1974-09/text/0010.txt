SO GET IT
Now if you happen to go to HSB one of these days you
may see a few guys tWlrhng pebbles at the end of a rubber
band. Don't bother to ask what they are dOing-they're
findIng the elm ratio. Maybe you don't swallow thiS but
if you have been in the 3rd year some tIme you'll know
aU about how to get mea,urements correct to three decimal
places USIng an unmarked ruler. No fault of the students,
though. We are gIVen lenses and microscopes and meters
that don't move. Get no result, you get no marks. So get
It-by all means get It from last year's records whIch probably
are straIght from Gahleo's or Newton's ongmal sheets.
