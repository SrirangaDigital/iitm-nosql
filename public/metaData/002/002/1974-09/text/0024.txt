Management Made Merry (For those of
You Who Plan to do the ATGSB)
The five main tenets of management are, or so we are led
to beheve, summed up by the acrostlc-cum-acronymn-cum
mnemOnIC (very Important ATGSB words, look 'em up If
you want to be a good manager) OSCAR_ Unfortunately,
only those managers who can't manage, teach, and the
ImpreSSIOn they gIve of the subject IS understandably exaggerated_ Here IS what management Is-we shall start wIth
OSCAR.
Organisation
ThIs IS what makes the management tIck every second and
cuckoo every hour hke a cuckoo-clock Before an orgamsatlOn can tIck and cuckoo It must have ItS AIMS and
OBJECTIVES clearly defined These usually con~lst of
ensuring that the chaIrman, hIS son, hIS wIfe and mother-mlaw are happy HapPiness IS not dIfficult to define, especIally at that level, papa chaIrman wants cIgars to chew,
son chaIrman wants to play Ice hockey at Harvard and sow
hIS wIld oats at RadclIffe, mama and mama-In-law chaIrman
(not char woman please I) want hundreds of trappers huntIng for sable and mmk to keep them warm In wmter m
spIte of central heatmg, electnc furnaces and hohdays m
Bermuda
Specialisation
The S m OSCAR-thIs means knowmg everythIng of
nothIng and nothIng of everythmg The more you know of
nothmg, the less the chance of you bemg asked to work on
anythtng else ThIS IS the gUldmg prmclple of most modern
managements and It took F. W Taylor to reahze It It IS
also the most dIfficult prmclple to pICk up and It costs
anywhere upto $6,500 to find out at the Harvard BUSIness
School.
A good manager-cum-speclahst never has to do anythmg
except when somethmg turns up m hIS field; and If he IS
any good then hIS field WlJI be somethmg m whIch nothmg
turns up. So a good speCialIst ends up domg nothmg Just
what he has been tramed to do There IS one snag thoughgettmg Jobs-he must convmce hIS employer that there IS
enough of nothmg gomg around
Co-ordination
Why the' C' comes after the'S' In OSCAR probably
shows that managers forget the IT alphabets easIly m buslDess
school, what wIth Greek and Latm and numerals lD Hmdu
ArabIc and Roman-anyhow CO-ORDINATION comes
thIrd and It IS essentIally the art of plaYlDg poker durmg office
hours while top management play brIdge (they call It tn-

22

basket games) and hne and staff play the Numbers Game (they
call It Gambhng). Co-ordmatlOn IS very Important, If you
are not careful you mIght find yourself left alone at the East
end of the bridge table with North, South and West mlssmg
when the chaIrman walks ill unexpectedly
Authority
ThIS compnses m possessmg the fight to get your subordmates to buy you coffee The hIgher your authonty
the more people you can get to buy you coffee and the
further the dIstance you can get them to walk to KmckKnack and back wIth larger flasks of the decoctIOn
AuthorIty filters downwards lIke gravIty, the shIp's
captam takes It out on the officer, the officer on the first
mate and so on tIll the cabm boy kIcks the shIp's cat If one
such fehne IS fortunately avaIlable, to say nothmg of what
the cat does to the shIp's mIce and rats
Responsibility:
The fight to say 'It's not my fault' The hIgher your
responSIbIlIty, the more often you have to say' It's not
my fault '. ResponSIbIlity IS mdlspensable many orgamsatlOn WIthout clearly defined responSIbIlIty, everybody WIll
be makIng mIstakes; now at least nobody makes mIstakes
that anybody knows about
BeSIdes OSCAR there IS a thmg or two you ought to
know If you want to be a superIor manager OSCAR IS
enough for those managers whose mtellectual pretenSIOns
and memory space stops at the Hollywood level. One of
them IS:
Span of Control :
ThiS represents the greatest distance you can get between
the tIP of your thumb and the tIP of the httle finger (both
mu~t belong to the same hand of course)
The world record
IS IS ms (38.15 cm for the metric enthUSIast) held by a
certam manager-understandably he wI,hes to remam
anonymOUS-he dIslocated hIS thumb m the process of
settmg up the world record-now he has five fingers on hIS
TIght hand and no thumb m apPOSItIOn to It and finds It
somewhat dIfficult to eat extra large sandWIches
The greater the span of control of your managers, the
thIcker the files they can carry and that helps save on fihng
costs
Motivation:
Is what's gIven to you for domg what you are not
supposed to do-its calJed actmg beyond the call of
duty.

Control:
ThIS ensures that employees do not do what they should
not do m office hours ThIS IS a most Important subject
to managers, after all they are there to see that what they
plan not to do IS not done at all even If what they plan
not to do IS not what should not be done
That's management as merry as I can make It Without
mIxed metaphors If you can get the hang of It may
be you WIll make a good manager If you can't, do not
despaIr, all IS not lost as you can stIli try the ATGSB.
The ATGSB weeds out the good materIal and sends only
the rest to the bUSIness schools.
