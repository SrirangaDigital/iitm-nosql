l>RISONER SEEKS CORRESPONDENCE
Editor, The Observer:
If at all possible please print the following words in your
campus newspaper.
I am in pnson and, being so, I am like an eagle without
wmgs. I know most people are afraid of other people who
are or have been 10 prtson, but to those people I say, yes I
committed a cnme or mistake, whichever you chose, and I
have paid for 11 a thousand Urnes over. But does the fact
that I committed a cnme make me any less human? I am
stili a hvmg, breathmg human being
My deSIre to correspond grows from my need of expressIOn untfied with my love and cunoslty of and for people.
C6nfined In pnson around other men twenty-four hours a
day, day after day. IS makmg me become stagnate. Indeed,
I need and must eXChange Ideals and Ideology with a
woman or at least someone who IS not confined
Maybe I have saId too much, or not enough. so all I
have tned to do is express my feeitngs for the need of
correspondence WIth someone.
How unjust would It be for all to turn their back~ to the
sun and see only their shadow cast upon the earth?
Thank you m advance for all and any conSIderation, of
wntIDg me. ConSider Wrillng A Prison, WhX Not'
