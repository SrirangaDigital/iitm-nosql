AN EXCURSION INTO THE VALLEY BrAUTIFUL
In these man-trampled tImes, any sort of escape from
anythmg man-made means ParadIse Re-gamed. To me,
much of KashmIr seems hke thIS.
TIme has never Journeyed to thIS land,
Flowers and heather bloom out of date,
The rocks Jut, the streams go Smgmg on either hand,
Careless If the season be early or late,
The skIes wander overhead, now blue, now slate,
Winter would be known by hIS cuttIDg snow
If June did not borrow hiS armour also.
l! was on a warm afternoon that our flIght, fight on
schedule, touched down at Srlnagar aIrport. AmIdst the
cllatter of excIted passengers and the cltcks of safety. belts
bemg unfastened, we were mformed that the temperature
outSIde was a cool 23 degree CelsIus.
I was thrilled ThIS was my first VISIt to the place of
whIch I had heard so much. And I was rIght here, in Its
hospItable caPIta).
The first ImpressIon that one gets of the aIrport IS that It
has a fnendly look The terminus has not been polIshed,
plated and prImed much and thIS gIves It an mfonnal and
welcommg atmosphere There IS greenery everywhere. At
what other aIfport can you find flowers growmg fight at
your feet? A soft breeze shuffles about, and the blossoms
bow as eaSily as geIsha-gIrls, theIr fragrance accompanymg
you nght from the tarmac to the termmus.
Our mltlal fears about transport proved to be groundless.
A Volkswagen had been arranged for us and we were
whIsked away to our place of stay-a house-boat. On our
way, I was conjUrIng up all sorts of boats, but the real one
outclassed even my wlidest conjectures. It seemed mcredlble to me that a house-boat could be so large and so handsomely furnIshed. It was an absolute pleasure to stay there,
catered to by an ever-smJimg face.
But we had come to travel around and see KashmIr and
tired or not, we were not to be held back by anythlDg. That
very afternoon, after our arrIval, we were told that the
servIces of a 'shlkara' belongmg to the house-boat, were
reserved for us. A 'shlkara' IS as long as a rowmg
boat but It bas a canopy and cushiOned seats, wblch make It
much more comfortable. A paddle, and not an oar, IS used
to propel the 'shlkara' The boatman SIts, precanously
perched, at the stern and It was a constant source of wonder
to me bow our old coxswam and hIS very young son plIed
theIr paddles apparently unweaned, and prepared to go on
forever.

We glided on mto the dIstance, skirting the outer fringe
of the lotuses, to our first halt at Char Chmar, the place of
the four massive Chlfiar trees. Planted centUrIes ago these
trees still stand four-square and aloof, on an Island m the
Dal Lake, the only four-square Chmar spot on earth
At a 20 mInute slow-rOWIng dIstance IS Nlshat Bagh ThIS
, Garden of Pleasure', buIlt by Shah Jehan, IS one of the
many gardens for whIch Kashmir is famous. BUIlt by
Mughal emperors, who had an eye for beauty. these gardens
have endured through the ages and remam, breath-takmgly
beautIful even today.
Understandably, m earlIer times, gardens were considered
to be an expressIOn of love and affectIon, a clasSIC example

of thiS beIng the renowned Shalimar Bagh. It was built by
JehJnglr and ItS beauty reflects hIS mtense love for Noor
Jehan, hIS Wife. Her chIldhood name was Meher-ul-OIsa,
but the name Noor Jehan. meaning 'LIght of the World',
was gIven her by her beloved Legend has It that both were
extremely fond of beauty and one day, when on one of theIr
annual VISIts to Kashmir, they chanced upon a pdrtIcularly
enchantmg spot, Noor Jehan VOIced her deSire that a garden
be bUIlt there and from that Wish grew the realIty of the
most famous garden m the world ' Bagh " lOCI dentally,
stands for' garden '.
Busy gardeners work fUriously to mamtaln the beauty of this
place, whIch draws thousands of Vlsltors even today. Every.
