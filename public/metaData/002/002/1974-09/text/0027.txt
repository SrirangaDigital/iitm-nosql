Editorial
It's amazing the amount of power educational institutions
exercise over their students. Take the case of the
IIT&. By a system of rules that the authorities have
concocted, they decide who IS and who Isn't good enough
to get m. If he IS lucky, the aspIrIng candidate IS certIfied
as a worth·whIle credIt nsk. He steps In, smugly compo
lacent of his bright future. full of hopes and dreams and
of the aspIratIons of his parents. Five years later he steps
out, metamorphosed into a disIllUSIoned cyme.
During these nve years he is evaluated on the basis of
how well he has played the academic game. how well he
has observed the rules. Rules over which he has no
control. For instance, his grades play a deCISive role III
determming hIS future prospects, yet he is In no pOsItIon
to question the mOde of evaluatIon. HIS teachers to a
large extent deCide hiS worth as an engineer, yet he can
neIther question their ablhty to teach nor the relevance of
what he IS beIng taught. Treated like a chIld, he IS kept
in a perpetual state of Intellectuallubservlence. He IS the
obJcct, more of attention than of understanding. more of
autboTity than of control.

The characteristic feature of the UTian psyche is a deepseated pnvausm. He IS forever busy domg hiS own thing.
In matters concernmg the larger commuDlty he finds
himself helpless Yet, it IS fatally dangerous to aqUiesce
to thIS feelIng of indiVIdual helplessness because of the
Immense power available to the admlOlstratlon and the
professors, over the mdlvldual student. Unless the IITIan
IS wllhng to break out of the she1l of hiS own personalIty
and to questIOn every smgle rule that he so wllImgly
obeys, unless he loses that sense of settled response and
beginS to probe for the truth, education ID lIT Will
gradually become a meanmgless farce.
In this editorial I wish to focus attention on two aspects
of the undergraduate education-the relevance of the
curriculum and the quality of teachmg.
Any form of education must have clearly defined goals.
This reqUIrement IS all the more deSirable m a techDlcal
IOsutuuon. So If IIT expects liS students to submit to Its
authollty, it would be a good Idea to let them know why.
It should start by clanfylOg Its values by puttIng things
into perspective and by ensurlOg that Its students are
working for goals that are genulOely held as pnmary. I
have raised thiS Issue because a lot of stuff that IS taught to
the IITlan seems to be Irrelevant to englOeenng. For
example. should every lIT student be subjected to such
extensIve courses ID AtomiC PhysIcs? He 1S made to go
through so much of Schrodmger's Wave EquatIon and

!}els:~::r~eu~~~~a(ni!n~fPlth~~:dY~~c~:~ un~~~~i~

teachers redouble their energy 10 emphaSIZIng It'S nonessential
aspects. ThiS was amply demonstrated lD one of the
undergraduate labs, where the \ab'lOcharge refused to
explam the correct method of calculatIOns for a partIcular
expenment but spent a conSiderable amount of lime
inSlStmg that the lab·report must be submllted In A4 size
lab·sheets, that the name must be wntten on the top Tlghthand corner and that the report must appear only on the
obverse Side (a strange proposllIon, conSiderIng the fact
that lab·sheets are very expensIve and very scarce).
In other words, academic life at lIT is beset by a great
deal of ntuals and phoniness. It IS commonly belIeved that
if certam prescnbed acts are properly performed, that IS,
if certain ntuals IJke lab report,wlltmg are earned out,
somethmg Important will result. although no one- really
knows how•
The second point that I wish to focus attention on is the
quality of teachlDg. The relevant role of any UDlverslty
is to teach. It IS only in thiS way that it can make a
slgmficant contributIon to the communIty. Yel teachlOg
seems to be the most neglected a~pect of the educatIon at
lIT. Just the other day, the Chairman of the AcademiC
Forum, Prof. Sam path, IDformed UG at the Forum meet·
ing that It IS not easy to remove an IDcompetent
lecturer. Does Ihls mean that the admlO'stralIon IS wlllmg
to compromIse the future of fifty or sixty students for Ihe
sake of a slDgle teacher? Irs about time that the IlTlan
was weaned ot these plastiC explanatIons. It·s about tIme
that he dId somethmg.
Those who were here during the employees' strike will
recall the tremendous enthUSiasm It generated and the mass·
ive student tnvo\vement. Wny can't the HTlan hav~ the
same degree of Involvement now? Does he always need a
crISIS 10 egg him on?
