PROMINENT FIGURES AND OTHER PERSONALITIES

PORTRAIT OF A PEERLESS PEGGY*
The UTIan audience and the IITJ3n caTlcatUrlst are two of
the most predictable of their respective speCie, If at
OAT. the former simply adores mushy songs of first Jove
{lr lost love, a cancature, the latter beheves, IS never
complete Without the' all said and done folks, he/she IS one
of the DlceSt people you can ever meet' Now, I wouldn't
say anythlDg as ommous as that BeSides, With a subject
hke mme, It hurts too much to say so.
It was July 72 when I first met her Walking unsuspectIDgly down the road, I espIed thIS funny-looking kid walklDg
(would you call that a walk? Well, for want of a better
wQ[d) a httle ahead of me. SuddenlY, she stopped A
httle monkey (busily lookmg at hImself m a dlfty puddle)
held her attentIOn He was facmg away from us and before
I could say 'scram, you epigram' she had IIptoed up,
slapped the monkey real hard and wa. runDing back With
a whole troop of monkeys chasmg her
When we finally got out of the mess, she explalOed
herself With 'But how was I to KNOW hiS people were
around? And It was SUCH a temptatIOn I ' And then,
With an air of absolute deJectIOn, 'And I don't know why,
but such thmgs keep happenmg to me' Now that I know
Llqa Raschld better, I don't doubt that for a mmute
That's one advantage of havlOg perspective
True, there's absolutely no situation you can possIbly
tblDk of that Llqa cannot get herself/anybody else/both
mto, and more often than not, get yoU to get her out of
Strangely enough, sooner or later you'll find yourself
makmg • heavy concessIons' for her The sanest (Imagme)
of Sarayultes have at some time or the other played a part
m one of Llqa's Innumerable misadventures If It Isn't
walkmg r.ght behmd her all the way from H S B because
she has torn her pants, It'S standmg next to her whIle
she's on the phone and screamlOg for her so she can end
tbat 'unfortunate conversation' WIth 'Listen, somebody's
calhng me, so bye' etc C~mmg to thmk of It, I'd have
to start a senal on thiS subject If I were to list all such
occasIOns (I'm gomg to caU It the Mad-Hatter's Other
diary)
While our hves were thus affected, the guys had long
gIven up whlstlmg at any glTl who appeared near theIr
hostels, for want of bteath really, smce Llqa biked up and
down too often and didn't make the scene only to vote for a
class rep There were probably two many milk-boys gomg
around already The lecturers found themselves addressmg
here as 'Llqa ' IDstead of ' MIss' the way they used to. Why,
there was tlus day when a gnm-Iookmg Prof looked
grnnmer than ever. As he went past On hiS vehIcle, we

saw hgbt There was Llqa, perched on the pIllion m her
favourtte paIr of shorts and the lOevltable T-shirt It
wasn't surpnsmg that the Professor was gOing at top-speed,
for Llqa was shoutlDg mto hiS ear through a mouthful of
Ice-cream The Prof was on leave tbe next day. He'd
suffered a mIDI-nervous breakdown
In some ways Llqa IS qUite a conformIst. SometImes she
IS too much of one
In their first year, most girl, seem
to beheve that If there's any change m venue for a lecture
the guys would know about It So all you've got to do IS
take some time gettmg out of the classroom and follow
them bhndly down the comdor It's a plan that's never
failed That doesn't deter Ltqa She can still show It's
not fool-proof ' It was Simple,' she saId, 'all I did was
follow thiS group of guys and whenever they entered a
classroom, I generally stood outside' On one occaSion,
she stood there, I beheve, for twenty whole mlDutes.
When the guy she'd been peeflng at through the wtndow
couldn't stand It any longer, he walked up to her and saId
, If you Wish to Sit mSlde, you are '" elcome.' 'But the
pomt IS,' saId Llqa, 'where IS the classroom?' 'Oh, I don't
know about that,' said the guy, shakmg hiS head sadly,
• we're here for a meetmg of the PhotographIc Club'
But all thiS fades In companson With what happened
to Llqa dunng the stnke There was thiS day when after
a power-failure, the lIghts finally came on at Sarayu, Llqa
heard a gentleman outSIde say 'So everythmg's 0 K I
guess' She hapPIly presumed that thl. guy WdS re,ponslble
for the laghts COIDlOg on Soon after he pushed off, the
hghts went off too FeelIng It her duty to fetch the savIOur
back, she broke IOtO a run The guy, worktng at the
transformer behind Sarayu, meanwhIle, saw Llqa, screammg
• Help 1 Help I' and runmng for all she was worth. You
know how pamcky people were those days These guys
were no exceptIOn Sensmg dIsaster, they ran after her
with' What, Who, Hey, Relax, Tell us all I ' Now Llqa
Isn't sucb a dumb kid, really. One look at them and the
transformer and she guessed Tight In an effort to really get
away with It, she turned around and ran straight back.
The guys thought she was too troubled to know where she
was gOlDg and followed her, Now the crowd m front of
Sarayu saw a white-faced Llqa (If that IS pOSSible) followed
by a couple of guys and they glared at the guys The guys
gave up trymg to understand what was happenmg.
A lotofpeopie, while agreemg that Ltqa's great fun the
way she IS, have made the sad predIctIOn that at some
stage of her Iafe, she'll sober down and have normal thoughtprocesses. But I can only Visualize a lady who suddenly
dashes across the road to stare hard (and most obViously)
at the strange matenal of a shirt or to say , Hello' to a
baby m a pram. If you do come across such a speCImen,
folks, try yelhng' Ado, Hoo' (which seems to me the
SlDgalese eqUivalent of' Hey' I) and If she turns around,
God bless you, you've met HER. Yes, you've met Llqa,
V. G,
the UDlque and Imffiltable,

The AcademiC Forum IS a body, compnsmg
staff and student represelltatJVes, which deals With
problems pertammg to academiCS only.
It acts
as an adVisory body for the Director, suggesting
proposals for actIon and has no execulive
powers
In Its first meetlDg of tlllS semester, the Forum
discussed the folJowmg proposals;(I) Funlshment for malpractices In examma~ons should be made very deterrent.
If a student IS caught employmg unfaIr
means 10 a penodlcal test, he Will be debarred
from attendmg the course for wbich the saId
penodlcal test was bemg held. The student wI11
be deemed to have failed that course.
For a similar offence In the semester examination, he will be debarred from pursumg his
studies for a year
(2) A proper set of rules governmg tbe postponement of penodlcaI tests must be evolved In the
case of a power fadure, penodlcal may be postponed only If the fadure is of more than an hour's
duratIOn
(3) A student wIll be expelled from the Instttute
if he IS unable to clear the first year in two years
on the first two years 1D fout years.
All class-representatives and the General
Secretary Mr. Sabhanayagam are members of
thIS Forum. So, you could conve}' your suggestions
to-them.
