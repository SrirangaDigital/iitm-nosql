The end of elected cbarisma and
tbe beginning of multiformity
Once upon a time, secretaries were rare birds (long-legged,
snake-eatmg birds of prey according to my dlc) who tended
to bring to their bird-ship a kind of personal flair that
carned them several cuts above the rabble Post-electIon
wmgs would sprout and the awed populace would watch
tbem eagles dare. You Sighed as you thought of the Justice
of everybody's collectIve chOice and the Jazz of big-bird
chaTlsma which these creatures would project to the expectant world as they spearheaded vanous migratIOns for
vanous occasIOns and brought home their hooty 10 pagan
splendour. It was a grand expenence while It lasted, and
one look at the steermg flock we have now will serve to
strengthen the dehberate need for all the nostalgia and
remmlscence. Of course, one cannot do much about dull
and umnspmng bIrds If there IS no better plumage from
whIch to choose Unfortunately, we are a pathetically
docile lot There are very few on the campus who would
care to be assertive when given the opportumty and the
medIUm, care to separate their mdlVlduahues from the
engmeenng rut and care to see that responsible posts are
not monopohsed by a motley bunch of ulcers (with one or
two excepttons, maybe) who would look more elegant If
hIdden away.
And to top It all, we have two head-birds, each moreexquisltely msufl'erablethan the other, a kmd of blustenngblUmVlT
that makes one begm to wonder whether thiS can truly be
the fascmatmg representative sample of what our mstltute
produces. But never mmd, the tTIbe has chosen Its schizOId
meSSIah well. Maybe we deserve no better for lettmg the

lopSIdedness of our electIon system do Its lDSldlOUS magic,
where the deservmg are trampled and the crude are frothed
out and given a free hand to mdulge m a spell of vlSlonless,
hYPocTitIcal finger-flex tOg. It IS a sad commentary on what
was once supposed to be a tradItIOn of JudICIousness and
good sense There may Just be one big consolatIon to all
thiS only a greater degree of commitment and awareness
(on the part of those who have not yet washed theIr hands
of any kmd of mvolvement here) wIll ensure that what they
do get IS what they would lIke to have certamly not a
multIform rash of say, half-a-dozen secretary-generals that
even the UN would shy away from.
Economising on rituals is
strictly for dream-time
They teU me that we are IIvmg m an age of enlIghtenment
Witness how sensItIve everybody IS to populatJon, pollutIon
and the economic cnsls And here, on thiS campus, we
produce tokens to thiS reduce-conserve-and-economlse
SPlI1t such as a five-clay-week and measures to consume
less paper and so on But when It comes to ntual-tIme, out
go these scrupulous affectatIons and the bIg admmlstratIve
wheels churn away to concoct bTllhant multi-thousand
rupee pageants that could easliy out-dazzle the trappmgs of
a rnoghul durbar on the eve of the emperor's coronatIOn.
Who do we conduct these super-decorated annual convocatIons for? Those who travel all the way here to be handed
that glonous scroll for which they had to go through a fiveor seven-year marathon are hardly Impressed by the fanfare
and display TheIr families are mterested ID seemg them
get the scroll anyhow The strugghng mass of those oncampus are hardly bothered about the grandolse occasIOn
as long as the hohday follows. The chIef deIty for the
occaSIOn goes through the process With mechamcal
obseqUIes for the odd hour and half So where IS all the
fevensh need for such an extravaganza? Maybe the gods
have to be appeased and the burnt sacnficlal offenngs have
to be placed on the altar of protocol and the glory of
mstJtutlOn, but would It make any dIfference If we had no
convocatIOns at all? Many other umver~ltIes have nd
themselves of these essentially ostentatIOus spectacles and It
simply goes to prove that at least some InstItutIOns have
the courage to kick hypocrIsy where It needs to be kicked
most, namely, 10 the rear. But as far as the admmlstratIon here IS concerned, everybody seems to have frozen
feet (Iet alone rears).
The need for inventing an adaptive,
outgoing, future-oriented education
Out of the hundreds of those here who are supposed to
be undergomg a great spell of techmcalmdoctfinatlOn, there
are very few who would care to pause and elCamme the value
or methodology of the framework they find themselves 10. It
requIres only a few mmutes of reflection to see that the
stuff that we denve from thiS so-called educatlve process
IS less than mediOcre, has no enhghtenmg quahtIes, produces no blaze of that sheer fanatIcal zeal whIch higher

educative structures are reputed to foster and often leaves
one WIth a vehement distaste for sCIence 10 any form
ThIS IS chiefly because we are trussed up lD an out-dated,
outmoded and monbund technIcal system that tells one
nothmg of the steady world-Wide progressIOns m elCpeTlmental modes of commumcatIon, future-orIented research and
processe; of adaptatIOn to change And If the vanous
dlsclphnes out here are badly geared to absorb and nouTlsh
the.e progressive academiC trends, It IS no wonder that
our understandmg of the engmeerIng sCiences IS begInmng
to get so rudImentary, statIc and haphazard that the best
of our graduates enterIng the mamstream of their respectIve fields are dlscovermg that they are Just beglOnmg to get
educated, all over agam It IS all very well to boast of
havmg a sophlstlcated computer and a lot of so-called
mter-dlsclphnary departments, but It must be recogDIzed
that It IS only through an orgaDlzed revltahzatlon programme of the dlsclplmes already eXlstmg can we hope to
achieve any reahstIc educatIonal structure It IS not
enough to maID tam that a foundlDg 10 claSSICal engmeenng
fundamentals can serve as a spring-board mto the changeoTlented world of tlIe present What we essentIally
lack JD our educatIve set-up here IS an orgaDized approach
to keep adaptlve processes working on the curTlculum A
few changes are seen now and then, but these are more or
less random gestures No slgmficant advances are ever
observed 10 the attItudes of those among the teachmg
faculty, shackled as they are to an absolutely bland, unmspmng approach to their respective subjects andmstructlOnal
methods It IS true that there are a few among them who
make bold attempts to keep pace WIth the challenges of
change, who try to dIVerSify and stlmulate the mobs presented yearly to them, but then, these are defimtely the excepttons. It IS Important to reabze that the process of
adJu~tment to change and a deliberate consolIdated effort to
usher to the future (the name for thIS IS prognostIcs) are
beconllng Vital and relevant features m all major academIC
centres the world over, not merely because It IS the fashIonable thmg to do, but because the highly accelerated and
hecttc nature of change on the Immediate matenal scale has
made It essentIal to hold educatiOn In a state of fiUlC If It IS
to be prevented from becommg totallY retrograde and
meanmgless And If there IS any sense m calling an
mstltutlOn of today a center of advanced learnmg, It can
only come from a smcere attempt from the part of those
responsible for the structure of educatIOn there to ensure
that what they buIld up wIll be adaptive, outgomg and
future-orIented at every level and 10 all CIrcumstances To
thiS end, It may be a good Idea to set up a seclJon or department of prognostics and progressive understandmg which
could serve to Inject a certam measure of hfe mto the
decaymg dISCiplInes we see all around us now. Would
anybody from the humamtIes department (also part of
the general decay, mCldentally) care to follow up the
suggestiOn?
