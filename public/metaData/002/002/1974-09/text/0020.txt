The editorship, or how to make
mincemeat as dmner for papa
There was, a short while ago, a magazme which took
shape with a streak of rebellion and managed to absolve
Itself from what seemed to be an mevltable collapse. but In
the process It also managed to absolve Itself from Its
primary readership, namely the odd two thousand of us here,
and papa, gIfted as he IS With ali-encompassIng Wisdom
decided qUickly and firmly that the time had come to exer:
clse his pubhshlOg prerogative and duly dumped the matter
of the edItorship mto a limbo, havlDg brushed aSide a few
lDconsequenllal nonunatlOns Campast/mes was once supposed to be a free-style, mdependent, student-based publlcalion WIth papa actmg as cheer-leader on the Side of the
tracks, the editor was not put under obhgallons (because he
happened to be the whim of some golden elected boy), but
then, you see. free-wheehng IS a luxury that cannot be
Indulged m on thiS campus, not as long as the almighty papa
and hiS brood contInue to display the Iron fists beneath
the velvet gloves. When do we eVer get out of the dark
ages?
For the very many among us who do profess to be
strongly opinIOnated about the things that we sense and
observe on tbls campus (but are rendered Impotent due to a
strong distaste for tbe msane gamut of the so-called electoral system here) thiS magazIne could be an mstrument of
strong and meaningful expressIOn. But thiS can only come
about If we see to It that the editor IS not bound by compromises, contracts and obhgatlOns thrown upon him by
papa and hiS handpIcked treasure-chest of commIttees.
Elected representatIves (who are, m general pleasantly
devoid of both ImagmatlOn and lIterary mclIna'ttons) have
no busmess setting up either the editor or h,s associates A
magaLme can be (,uly. cntlcally and frUItfully assertIVe only
If It IS aggressively mdependent; the moment ItS structure IS
abused and d,storted by strictures and pOilcles framed by
Fo~~.a's chosen ones the essent131 meanmg of Its eXistence IS
What each editor has to thmk about IS not merely how
best he can compIle the four odd Issues In hiS annual tenure
(and leave the magazine half-cocked for the wolves) but also
how best to ensure that what he has started IS properly
carned over and perpetUdted And to thiS end, the least he
can do IS to pomt out that as outgomg editor, he IS the
only person who can be m any pOsItion to assess the degree
of 1Ovolvement, the personalIty and the potenttal of the
next ed,tor And to ensure that, he should have tbe confidence to put hiS nommatlOn down m prmt m the last Issue
he edns, and hope like hell that papa honours It.
ThiS IS pretty obVIOusly the only way to ensure that thiS
magaZIne can become emphatlcally assertive, Vital 10 Its
qualotles of self-perpetuatIon and spiritedness, antiCipatiVe,
educative, compul~lvely readable and very very beautiful.

THE BUS-WALLAHS
My beard might turn flaming orange overmght-I wouldn't
be as surprised; I might even strike Oil In my kitchen
garden while digging for earlhworms-I wouldn't be as
happy; II might even be that thiS article will get pubhshed
In Campast/mes-even thiS wouldn't howl me over as the
bus-wallahs did that fine mormng
That partIcular mornmg had all the IngredIents essential
to the makIng of a rare day. fhe sun was mellow; there
were a few friendly clouds around, not the overfnendly
ones which begm to cry over your shoulder the mmute you
greet them, ' how do you do ?' But what really did portend
a happy day was that my shirt hadn't been debuttoned by
the overconscientious dhobl; the air, for once, was not
burdened by the gross sounds of the tea-shop radiO; and
the footpath was free of vagrants and dangerous dogs
There was a fair chance of a fine day ahead Except for
the bus-wallahs

It was still a full five-mmute leISurely walk on a fine
mormng (and a two-mmute walk If It has been a warmone)at thiS cntlcal distance when I was undeCided between preambulatmg slowly. mhalmg the mornmg aIr and putting out
what passes as my chest and muttermg to myself-' thiS IS
gomg to be a fine day' ten times, as suggested by the Rev.
Norman Vmcent Peale, and trottmg to the stop before the
next bus could roll past me obhvlOUS to my frantic hand
waving It was such a distance and such a day that I deCided
to give the Rev Peale a chance-poor man, hadn't he given
so much of hiS time trymg to Imbue 1Q me vltailty, verve and
an unfalhng confidence In !tfe and hope In a richer future?
(Only he got the ncher by a million copies at Rs. 7 a
piece and I was the poorer). It was at thiS Juncture-Just as
I was through my mnth repetltlOn-' EverythlOg Will go fine
by me today', when I Sighted the red monstrosity Why
dull red, I have always wondered Why not blue and cream
candy honzontals or why not blue polka dots on a !laming
orange background ?
It was qutte ful1 and I really didn't expect the buS' to
stop at the bus stand and anyway not near me But I did
wave my hand I I was a bit early that mornlllg and If I took
thiS bus I would be at work a lIttle too early, which I didn't
want to be. I Wished to be a httle late today. I would get the
opportumty to have a small ttff With my trammg supervlsor-' Can't get a bus these days Slf! Bus never stops'
You may wonder why anyone would want to quarrel on
such a fine mornmg. Ah' It IS here I have to expatiate
on thiS art WhiCh, I have watched others practIse
on some mnocent prey It IS not anythmg like a quarrel
you pIck up on a grouchy day With someone who does

your honour wrong (so you th1Ok) when he yells at you
and you yell back (and there IS so much heat all around
that you could bake a cake). and everyone around looks at
both of you and sDlggers to hiS heart's morbid dellght_ Nay,
you are sorely mistaken If you take thiS 'fine mommg tiff'
to be such an affair On such a fine morn 109 you don't
â€¢ Just pick up a quarrel' but you' CREATE ONE' , I hope
the subtle dlstmcllon IS not lost', (Incidentally thiS IS one
of the stock phrases to be used when creatmg a tilT) The
altercatton starts on a low key-both parties statIng theu
opmlons not absolutely opposed but haVing some undefined
common ground whICh If Idenllfied can resolve the confilct
But you don't allow your opponent to Identify thiS, since all
IS then lost So you raise our vOice a note up the scale
Your opponent, unless himself a past master of thiS art,
Will go 3 or 4 notes higher ThiS means a1l IS well You
have successfully ensured bhndlllg him to reason Next
raise your vOice a quarter note higher ThiS small excursion from your normal pitch Will tempt your antagoDlst to
screech hiS lungs out (At thiS stage you mlg"t even mildly
adVise him that hiS vOice box IS hable to damage) By now
you have attracted enough attentIOn. All you have to do now
IS to lower your vOice suddenly to somethmg Just about a
whisper, leaVIng your poor opponent yelhng hiS head off
and generally IllvIlJng a lot of unwanted attentIOn. And
then you can start smggermg (1Owardly of course, open
sDlggerlng IS a sign of coarseness and hkely to be construed
as ugly and rustic) A fine mornmg once agam If your
opponent IS your superVisor, he Will Wish you the very best
10 your future and give you the month's wages and maybe
deny you all the overtime you claim to have put m But
for thIS sort of precIpitous actIOn on the part of your
opponent due to hiS utter lack of humour and to hiS havmg
chanced to be 10 a station 10 hfe supenor to yours (which
you always felt he never deserved), thiS IS the best way to
start a fine day
As I said, [ was still some distance from the bus stand
when I waved my hand at the approachlllg bus. Why did I
wave my hand? Because It was a fine day and on a
fine day one does thmgs which wdl not stand the
scrutmy of logical reasonmg and logical reasoning
would have It that I would create a quarrel on a fine
day (see defimtlOn of fine day gIven ear her and repeated here
for conveDlence-a fine day IS a day on which you create a
tIff for no reason at all) and tlus logical reasonmg meant I
should not wave my hand Hence I did wave my hand.
QED (thiS IS something Similar to what I read III the preface to a book-' What Philosophy Is '-where you go
round and round the logtcal merry-go-round till you
reach a logical conclUSIOn) So by now I had waved my
hand, but dId not expect the bus to stop. Lo and behold, praise be to Allah, the dull red monster applied Its
'Caution, au brakes', and screeched to a halt nght 10
front of me. I was perplexed, I was dismayed; I was
