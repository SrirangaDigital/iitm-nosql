the objectIves of Campastlmes IS to focus attention on
problt"ms concernmg the students Can this be done without
hurtmg anyone?
A: In all such matters the code of the gentleman must
be kept m mmd. You should not try to burt anyone's
feehngs There IS more than one way, of saymg the same
tblDg Instead of saymg' You have done this work badly',
you could say 'Well, there are better ways of domg thIs,'
Q. In your days as dIrector. there was a lot of
contact between you and the students Is It pOSSible to
bave such contact now without the dlfector m any way
appearIng to mterfere In our affairs?
A: Oh yes, I used to VISIt the hostels qUIte often and
Sit down for meals with my young frIends without notice.
And durmg these VISits they would dISCUSS theIr problems
with me. Later I would meet my adVisory committee and
discuss with them the suggestions I had received from
the students. Then I would mcorporate these suggestIons
whenever pOSSible

Q: Does thiS lead to overfamiharity between st3ft' and
students In the class-room?
A: No, there IS no such thlng as overfamlliarity. All
that I am domg IS treatmg you D1cely; and If I treat you
ruc:lly you Will treat me well too
Q: Smce you were directly mvolved with the inception
of the InstItute, could you tell us something about the
original alms of the Institute?
A: ThiS Institute started purely as an undergraduate
InstItution. ThIS IS because no useful research can be
earned on without a firm undergraduate base There
should be a contmuous mteraction between research and
undergraduate work because It IS finally the undergraduates
who Will carry on the research
Q: There IS a lot of talk about laYing more emphasIs on
P. G. and research work m the IITs Does thiS mean that
the llT IS gradually beIng converted into a purely research
organIZatIOn?
A: No. I don't thmk so. Teaching undergraduates
should be the most important objective of the fITs.

Q: But IS there any motIVatIOn for better teaching Since
it appears that most teachers concentrate on research?
A: No, it IS rather sad that we have always taken lD
teachers on the baSIS of theIr research potentIal and not
on their teachmg ablhty or aptItude. I think thiS attitude
ought to be changed
Much as we would have liked to ask him many more
questIons he was called away to some other engagement.

How Esau Wood Sawed Wood
Esau Wood sawed wood. Esau Wood would saw wood.
All the wood Esau Wood saw, Esau Wood would saw. In
other words, all the wood Esau saw to saw, Esau sought to
saw. Oh I the wood Wood would saw! And oh! the woodsaw with which Wood would saw wood' But one
day Wood's wood-saw would saw no wood, and thus the
wood Wood sawed was not the wood Wood would saw if
Wood's wood-saw would saw wood. Now, Wood would
saw if Wood's wood-saw would saw wood. Now, Wood
would saw wood with a wood-saw that would saw wood.
So Esau sought a saw that would saw wood.
One day Easu saw a saw saw wood as no other woodsaw. Wood· saw would saw wood In fact, of all the
wood-saws Wood ever saw saw wood, Wood never saw a
wood-saw that would saw Wood as the wood-saw Wood
saw saw wood would saw wood. I never saw a wood-saw
that would saw wood as the wood-saw Wood saw J would
saw wood until I saw Esau Wood saw wood with the wood·
saw Wood saw saw wood. Now Wood saws wood With the
wood-saw Wood saw saw wood
