astonished; I was angry. How can he stop when I wave
my hand Now I couldn't curse hIm, damn hIm and
generally send hIm In the duectlon of hell.
KlOdness IS born only In a soul whIch has known kindness I have known no kindness from bus dnvers and
anyway I have no soul. I lost It the other day when I
traded It away for a npe mango I came to the conclusIon
(a weIghty one at that)-tt IS Indeed a rare day. I was
satIsfied wtth thIS. But [ sltll hadn't decIded what to do
Should I run away from all those leermg SImIans and theIr
slmpenng faces. But for all 1 know the entIre busload may
crawl out and run after me Why should they do a thlDg
hke that? I know my maths pretty well and my probabIlity
theory better, and logIC of course IS my forte
ComblDmg
the three as follows (one table-spoon ful! of each), r made
my deCISIOn If [ran away, what was the probabJilty that they
would chase me 7 You cannot answer thIS unles~ you have
performed the expenment any number of tImes (Ideally)
tIll your legs ache from runmng and your heart IS Just one
beat from burstmg So I dIdn't know the probablhty. It
could be I and then God save me Thus I dlalectlclsed wIth
myself and concluded It was safer to board the bus, and
board It I dId, wIth a heart burdened wIth fear and abram
weary from overuse. r looked at all the people In theIr
seats and all the people cJmglng to those shackles on the
cellmg, preSIded over by the conductor at the top step
leaDIng casually on the banmster. I boarded the bus. I
was on the second step The conductor blew hIS whIstle
He blew It shnlly mto my ear. My mmd went berserk,
but even ID that lOstant I saw It all before me clear
as Moses saw the commandments-the conductor was
even more VICIOUS than I had gIVen hIm credIt for;
he was gomg to tnp me and push me off the bus
r couldn't Jump off because the dnver ID collusIon WIth
the conductor was now speedmg So I jumped IDto the
bus, and Jumped 'mack IDto a not so elderly female. I
looked around fearfully But no one seemed to even look
at me (except myself); the conductor was all smIles and
asked me very pohtely where I wanted to go He even
accepted my ten rupee note for my 20 paIse tIcket He
dIdn't order me off the bus; he dIdn't ask me why nlDcompoops such as I dIdn't carry 20 paise on them He Just
accepted my ten rupees
I was so dazed I forgot to ask hIm for the change,
whIch I realIzed only after gettIng off the bus So now I
cursed hIm squarely and roundly (and also rectangularly
too).
It was a fine mormng after all I dIdn't mind the loss
slDce they (dnver and conductor) were bound to be struck
down by the plague If It hadn't by now got them

JUST FINGS
I have an unaba~hed admIration for the Seasoned
Traveller-the kmd of person who, ID a Western epIC,
dozes ea,lly In the stagecoach, oblIvIOUS to the heat and the
files, whIle lesser mortals make frequent and pamful
contact WIth the woodwork behmd them One occaSIOnally
comes acros~ the modem versIOn of the type on a tram
ThIS person uncurls hImself from hiS foetal posture on
the mIddle berth, casually clImbs down WIthout rapplDg
hIS head or barklDg hIS shlD on numerous sharp prOJectIOns,
and announces WIth Just the rIght amount of weartness
that we ought to have reached ltarsl forty mInutes back
The whole thlDg IS magnIficently done, rather Itke Jove's
descent from Olympus I nurse varIOUS brUIses and look
on 10 envy.
It's not one of those thmgs that comes WIth frequent
travel. I've travelled around qUIte a bIt and stili jam my
thumb when I try to pull down the shutters. Whereupon
the seasoned traveller tells me klDdly that I'm dOIng It the
wrong way. I IDvanably go through the traumatIc experience
of seemg the soap shp out of my hand and go through tiJe
lIttle hole they have ID the tOIlet.
I fumble for my tIckets whIle the examiner's mitlal
dIstrust turns to dark suspiCIOn, and finally locate them
Just as he's reachmg for the handcuffs. The seasoned
traveller meanwhIle hands over hIS ttcket for InspectIOn
WIthout even lookmg up from tiJe book he's readlDg. HIS
book has an IOvltmg blonde on the cover-the only readIng
materIal I have IS GalbraIth's The Affluent Society. And
after the long gnmy journey, I draw a porter who has
tWO-Inch fangs and IS prepared to use them The seasoned
traveller saunters by, carrymg Just one aIr-bag and looking
lIke the proverbIal daISY .. ,
There's no place lIke home, really.
The last week was somethmg of a revelatIOn. Even the
normally godfearmg succumbed to the urge The old oak
chests were emptIed Stray COlDS counted Armed WIth the
Just rewards of a lIfetime of moderatIOn, the most sober of
the junta made a beelIne for Coronet For when one IS
forced, wIilymlly to go on the wagon, the destre to step
high, WIde and plentiful, to go on one IdSt memorable
bender IS ITreSlStlble And so It was that crowds of the
happy drunk, the fighting drunk and the merely drunk
waIted for the 10-35 at Adyar every night
DefylOg all
known laws, the mountalD had come to Mohammed,

that gemal dIspenser of happmess at Coronet. Armed WIth
a bottle-opener and a smIle, he watched tndulgently as
they mIXed exotIc concoctIons, exchanged uproanous Jokes
and, If the mood was upon them, sang 10 ragged chorus.
And If some of the regulars stopped to shake hIS hand as
they staggered out, who would blame them? In some
IDdefinable way, he was the symbol (as was the opener) of a
good time that had come to an end.
One of Wodehouse's mmor claSSICS IS about the Wily
Pathan. It appears that whIle you're shadlDg your eyes and
lookmg for hIm on the pahaar, he sneaks up behtnd you
from the maldaan I always thought we were the only
people who CrIbbed about the way thmgs are run m thIS
IDsutute All the whIle, some enterpnsmg staff reporter
has been creepmg up from the maldaan WIth hIS typewriter
between hIS teeth. Mud has been slung Charges have been
levelled. The Blck-kDlves are out m the open And Zeus
has revealed a ghastly sense of humour. When the dust
finally settles, the Campastlmes EdItor wtll stIll be wandering
around for artIcles Only everybody Will be too busy
sklrmlshlDg In the newspapers, to wTlte.• _.•
One feature that the average I1Tlan has ID common WIth
that estImable pIg, tiJe Empress of Blandmgs, IS tiJe flng he
wears ID hIS nose But whIle the abIlity to be led ID any
gIven dlrectton IS admIrable ID a pIg, the same ablhty
hardly reHects to the IITtan's credIt A goodly number
SIgned the petltlon protestmg agamst the unnecessary
expense on the convocatIon Havmg done theIr bl! for the
cause they sat back, and waIted for results. Zeus thereupon
Issued a proclamatlon that the bmge was costmg us only
thIrty grand. At thIS pomt, one would have expected any
normal thmkmg person to say [zzatso? Instead of whIch
the average IITlan sallIed forth to lIsten WIth monumental
patIence to a senes of dreary harangues. The pnze Item
was undoubtedly the one about the bullock cart. It appears
to me that the logIcal Improvement to the BC era that yet
rem aIDs to be made IS for us to develop an Improved Mark
II bullock glvmg, as Badn says, about I 5 bullock power.
However, that Isn't the pOIDt The address was duly
delIvered ID a neutral monotone, rather hke a lItany. For
thIrty grand, you are entttied to elCpect people to have
someth'ng to say. We got mstead, a ghost-Written speech
tiJat only narrowly escaped bemg ghost-read.
