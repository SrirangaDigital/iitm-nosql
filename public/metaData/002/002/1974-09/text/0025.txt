Campastimes deeply regrets the sudden demise of Mr. Kaleem
( 5 Iv Electronics) and Mr. Ravindran (Research
Scholar~ Chemistry).

Weill Another new semester. Guys have come and guys
have gone (mostly gone), but the Meet goes on forever So
how are the teams shaplDg up ?
rn athletIcs, we've taken a body bloW, seemg as how half
the team seems to have passed out
DavId Roby,
Chandran Paul, Ashok Chanda, Jakes SIgh I However,
there IS a silver hmng. Fresher Lobo IS a hat man In the
sprints, and there are rumours that one darn good athlete
may be commg mto Industrial Engmeermg (thanks there,
Dr Anantaraman) Another consolation IS that no other
lIT has a really ~trong athletics team-Deihl have lost
mdlvldual champIOn Upadhyay and the ternble DalJlt, so
that's last year's champions out of the runnmg We seem
to be strong In the throws thIs year Indesa, John LOUIS,
BenJamm, plus a couple of newcomers hke Chandl and
Kasbekar Chou's back, so the triple jump gold IS In the
bag, perhaps along wIth both the -hurdles Then there IS
Venky and Bahal 10 the sprmts, Javed In long dIstance,
Jayasmgham 10 hIgh Jump, ChlOnathambl and Sageer m Pole
Vault, Karl for long jump and trtple Act1VJtles st,arted
pretty late tbls year, and the non-medalhsts meet wasn t any
thunderIng success. Stili tbe outlook's faIr Call It a
probable SIlver.
Basketball-well that trophy's been WIth us SO long that
It has prachcally g;own roots here. ThIS year's no exception, either The team roster IS a mce, comfortmg one;
lookmg at It, one can feel the gold 10 the kItty already
Chandran Paul's gone; but 10 spIte of that the team IS still
extremely strong Dayal, Gopal, Knshnakumar, PK and,
of course, the evergreen Krtshnan Same team that wrapped
up five major tournaments last year No problems here
Footer has an unenVIable record The hard fact remams
that we haven't scored a smgle goal 10 any meet so far. We

mIght be able to change that SituatIOn thiS year. The new
captatn-Sattsh-Is good; uses hiS head as well as bls feet,
unhke some people I could mention The team seems to
have more enthu thIS time, despIte losmg to Thyagaraja
(tough guys) m the mter-colleglate One good newcomer IS
Chandra Mohan from GUindy Meet chances? Let's be
pessImIstIC and call It a bronze
The hoc1<ey team of yesteryear has practtcally dIsappeared
Raghu, Chlkkl, Raj, DavId, and Kanm are out, practIcally
every good forward we had Defence IS sohd, WIth Sun and
dependable D'Soo, Bozorgl and Savant Chandoke IS a
newcomer (and a good one) ID the forward Ime, WIth vet
Jayakumar The team IS good but mexpenenced, they've
made It to the semI-finals of the IDter-colleglate so far
Should chalk up at least a SIlver at the Meet.
In gymnastics, we've lost BadamI The number of
gymnasts ID the team has been mcreased to SIX thiS year, from
four last year Pratap, Abdullah and Royo form the backbone GymnastIcs has been Delhi's forte for qUite a few
years, but thiS year three of the IT top people have passed
out Kanpur IS commg up, though, and we'll have some
sttff competltLon from them Our team made a bronze last
year, we have good chances for a SIlver thIS hme It may
be recalled that there was qUite a storm about' partIal
Judgement' at tbe Bombay meet, thIS year It bas been
decIded that the judges' deCISIon will stick, Impartial or
otherWIse.
'
Tenms has taken a setback WIth the loss of Prof and
Ramkumar but CaptaIn Danl rates our chances for a gold
as very hIgh Only team Irkely to gIve trouble IS Bombay,
who still have Fazalbhoy Qur doubles pair IS the same as
last year's Dam and Sekhar Sekhar, mCldentally, made It to
the semI-finals In the Bertram Tournament, gOIng down to
Knshnan Jr The doubles combo made It to the semis ID
the Bertram, too In the mler-colleglate, we've won so far
and should top 111 our zone A bIt of tough luck that
partiCipatIon ID the mter-U IS out of the questIon; the dates
are fixed as Nov 5th and 6th, smack at the begmnmg of
exam time
The table tenms team IS unchanged; last year's champIOns, theY're a cert to make It thiS time too RaJ ago pal,
Ravi and Parthasarathy are as good as ever. The gold's as
sure as 10 basketball

In shuttle, Eddy's gone A senous loss whIch can't be
laughed off Frank and Kumar are stili there from last
year. Our chances are uncertam, but a silver would seem
to be a reasonable (If shghtly optimistic) predIction
The outlook In volleyball IS good Despite the fact that
we've lost four of last year's players, the splkers are sull
there Under LInUS the team has a pretty good chance of
wmnmg through to a gold, not a SIlver Itke last tIme.
Welghthftmg has always been a Madras speclahty and thIS
year (wIth a httle bit of luck) It should stay that way.
Though we've lost three good men m Shldore, Apte and
Gunda, newcomer Rustom (heavyweight) shapes up well.
Overall? Well, we hauled out the shde rules and did a
lIttle bit of figurmg; crossed our fingers and figured some
more. ApprOXImate total comes out at about 65 pomts,
whIch should get us the champIOnshIp for the fourth time
runnmg.
Hopefully.
As far as non-meet Items go, Cricket IS first on the hst.
Half the team's gone here, too-Goun, Murah, Dlpankar,
Kakes, and Ramesh. Bharadwaj and RaJarnam are the two
freshers There seem to be qUite a few problems regardlDg
eqUIpment, here as well as In hockey Chrome shortage of
bats/sticks, even tbls late In the season Needs a bit of
lookmg mto. CrIcket chances m the Inter-U-end of the
year-are uncertam, WIth only Mahesh, Kasbl and Naxl to
fall back On.
The sWlmmmg team's coming on well, despIte the fact that
the pool stIll Isn't ready We had mdlvldual rnedalhsts In
open meets last year, and should be able to repeat the perform3nce thiS year Efforts to have It Included as an mterliT meet aem died a qUIck death
The ball badmmton team (yes, mdeed-we dJJ have one)
has done fairly well m outSIde tournaments, but the captam
IS screammg about equIpment shortage It's a regrettable
fact (nonetheless true) that nobody takes thIS game very
senously It s a sltuauon that needs to be remedied
As for Chess and Bndge, the standard IS faIT There IS
no formal Institute Brrdge Team, but we do have several
good players gomg. The Chess team has lost KK, but
Sudhlr and Alyaswamy should put in a bIt of good work
SRlKANT.
