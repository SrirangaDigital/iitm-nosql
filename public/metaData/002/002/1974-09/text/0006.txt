of Silv~r

A herd of cows was passmg by In a slow, shufflmg
bunch, hooves klckmg up a movmg blanket of dust, and tbe
girl stopped to watch them, thumb mmouth, twognmy books
m a restless hand, her dark, coffee-coloured eyes so wIde
open that you may have found It dIfficult ever to Ignore
them. Nor could you look away from that elfin form, the
dust-covered bare feet, a WISpy, feather-floatmg qualIty that
only a faIry can naturally cIaIDl Even as she watched, one
of the black cows made a deep, bellowmg nOIse and broke
away from the herd, runnmg expertly at right angles to
the path, straIght Into a grassy field, mOVIng black agamst
the green Then, as the farm-boy shouted and ran after
the adventurous COW, she drew her thumb away from her
lIps and laughed, peal after peal of sheer exuberant dehgbt,
thumpmg her knees WIth the books until the pages were In
danger of commg apart from theIr mOOrIngs.
Soon the dust had settled back on the forgiVIng earth and
one more hvely facet of passmg lIfe was deeply etched mto
her colour-thustmg mmd. Those movmg lImbs, those
disorderly smudges of brown, black and whIte as they had
tumbled past In the glOrIOUS sheen of dust-fogged sunlIght,
the eager bOVIne bId for lIberty, the eXCited chase and
finally, the recapture, each full of coloured wealth, were
iOlages that were growIng so crystal-clear and photo-sharp
that It almost began to hurt mSlde her head. She shook
herself as though to get rId of these thmgs and tned to
focus her glazed Imagmauon on a wood-pecker as It floated
by In a sharp curve and settled down to begm a deafenmg,
harsh staccato at the lower branches of a nearby oak The
bnght orange of the pluOlage and the dark, shadowy base of
the tree combmed and suddenly Howed mto a smgle burst of
fantastic colours and s1>e was caught up agam on the edge
of a familIar rambow-lIke Shell, a SWirl of radIance so pOignant In Its mmd-numbmg lovelmess that It made her want
to laugh and cry at the same time. And as she stood
transported there on the dust-road that was her way back
home from school, a worned mother was frettmg and
w3Itmg for her daughter With a cold cup of rmik
When the dairy-man passed along the path that evenmg, he
was whistling snatches of a half-forgotten folk-song and
madly strUgglIng to make the horses trot In phase to the
tune, and he was so engrossed m hiS task that he almost
!DIssed the recumbent figure on the boulder along the
roadSide, gnmy, covered With dust and leaves, and fast
asleep BeSide her, two equally dirty booles lay Bappmg
and open In the breeze. Exhausted by the big efforts to
shake free the accumulated pressure of her Images, she had
simply curled up and dropped Into oblIVIOn. Now, as tbe

dairy-man reined in CUriously, he let out a startled hoot
In an hiS twenty years of road-and-wagon experIence, he
had never come across a more sorry SIght, and he was down
on hiS knees beSide the child at once, dusttng the breezecooled arms and speakmg gently as she stirred up from a
dream-saturated world of her own. He swung her up mto
hIS huge, gnarled arms, and consoled her as she began to
cry, much as he had often consoled hiS trustful horses
when they had snapped tendons and cast shoes In hurtlIng
him to some remote dairy-cali on those stormy days when
all the slush and debrIS of the earth seemed to accumulate
on the roads Bemg the worldly and undetstandmg father
of two daughters, he soon managed to put the gIrl at
ease and found that her home was close by and on hiS
route, or at least that was what he deduced from her vague
instructIOns. Takmg her to the wagon, he set her down on
an empty mIlk Jar WIth her bOoks, patted her tousled head
and made faces at her until she gnnned and finally burst
out In a shrtek of laughter. The falling mantle of mght
was now drawmg tightly around them, and smgmg brokenly, the rems hangmg ID hmp catenary-hnes frOID hIS
fingers, the dairy-man rode on unttl the gIrl cned out for
him to stop, then sprang out of the wagon and ran straIght
mto the arms of her dIstressed mother, Who was on the
verge of a nervous collapse. She thanked him profusely
and even mVlted him to share supper with her, but he
declIned pohtely and was Soon on hiS way agam, singIng very lustily as he gUIded hIS horses mto the mght.
There was a gentleness m the sunltght as It splashed
in broad yellow beams upon the untidy mess of canvassheets, planks, upturned bottles and bIts of stnng spread
on the floor of the open wooden cabm Slttmg crouched
on a three-legged stool, the old pall1ter waIted WIth pOIsed
brush until hiS sun-warmed senses told him that the grand
moment was upon hIm Except for the long, hIgh-pItched
reveIlle of hiS pet rooster from some strategic perch outSide, the pamter, engrossed 10 harneSSing the white
lumlOoslty of the mormng-sun, was momentarIly sealed
In a mute chamber of pure lIght and shadow, colour and
radiation and the countless sparkles and gittters that every
one of us can see but very few can comprehend As he sat
there, squmtmg and drunk WIth delIght, hiS huge, coloursplotched beard flew up In the wmd and patiently, he
worked upon thiS frozen drop of natural stillness, drew It
upward In hiS breath mto a turbulent pool somewhere m
hiS chest and discharged It, gently, delIberately, through the
fine, faithful brIstles of hIS brush, upon the blank, barren
emptmess of the canvas, hIS eyes dIlating With pleasure as
he watched the wonder spnngmg to lIfe before him.
The old paInter looked up from hiS canvas A woman
stood at the cabll1-door, holdll1g a young gIrl by the arm.
In the other hand, the woman carned a sheaf of papers.

'Come m, Senora You too, my lIttle one I'm sorry I
cannot get up from my work now. Once I SIt down,
I have to fimsh thiS WIthout pause otherWise It wIll never
'
be whole m my mmd.'
The woman nodded and moved to a corner of the studiO
WIth the girl There was complete Silence except for the
chlfpmg of bIrds outSide. After an hour, the old Olan
fimshed the scene to thiS salIsfachon, and laId down hIS
brush and palette With a Sigh He found the child standing
besldehlm,gazmg raptly at the canvas, and he was struck by
the II1tenslty of her dark eyes as they SWIvelled up and down
He took her mto hIS arms and ran hiS rough, bony fingers
through her mop of brown hair
'You lIke It, little one?'
The woman, who had been watching Silently and beammg
at them, shuffled forward and waited untIl the amused old
man had finished playmg a traditIonal game of nose-rubbll1g With her child
'Her name IS Rusa, Senor I am her mother I have
come to you because people told me that you are a great
artIst You see, Rusa IS not wellm her mmd, she stands
at one place and becomes lost, or she goes to Sleep m the
middle of her classes, and some days she runs away and
cannot explam where she has gone or where she has come
from I am fnghtened for her
The doctors, they say
she IS all rIght and laugh at me and tell me all chIldren wIll
be lIke that. But I know something IS very dIfferent about
my Rusa. So I bnng her to you'
The old man was sIlent for some time.
, I Will help you, Senora. But tell me, I am only a painter, why do you thmk I WIll be able to tell you what the
doctors cannot tell?'
'Because of these, Senor', she laId the sheaf of papers
before hIm and watched hun With ImplOrIng eyes. The
old man put Rusa down and picked up the papers and
unrolled them
Only once, It IS said, does an artist see 10 the COUl'Se of hIs
lIfe a sudden stark revelatIon of everythlDg that naturally
comes to hIS dreams but rarely condescends to flow from the
skIll of hiS fingers and the warmth of hiS heart. When he
opened the first sheet which the simple-mmded woman had
given him, the old man knew that thiS was hiS moment of
revelatIOn In the scene that lay spread out before hIm were
all the vlsta~ and rollmg stretches of colour, bnghtness,
darkness, agitatIOn, peace and Joyousness and sorrow and
a millIon shades of feelmg too sharp to have a name, too
plentIful to be numbered. And all these from a chIld, a
Olop-headed, playful httle gIrl whose frettmg Olother was
laughed at by pompous doctors for bemg so concerned
about het daughter.
'Please, Senor, now do you see why I came to you ?' her
vOIce quavered and as she watched hIS face, the contractIOn
of hiS brows, the sad and gentle expressIOn on hiS face was
