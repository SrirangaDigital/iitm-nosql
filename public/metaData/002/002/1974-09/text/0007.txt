replaced by his smile as he turned to her. He took Rusa
again Into his arms and gazed mto those sparkhng eyes.
Here he was, on old, decrepit, much-acclaimed paInter who
Imagmed that he had found for himself every possible
nuance of beauty and wonder on his canvas, pndmg hlIDself on his msplratlOn and understandmg all these many
years, and suddenly here was a mere child, a WISP of a
girl, who could put him to shame and humiliatIOn wordlessly and without even knowIng what she had done.
â€¢ Yes, Senora, I can see why you have come It IS good
that you have come to me, your Ru,a has made me a
humble man LIsten carefully to me now, for you may
not understand much of what I wIll try to tell you, as you
are a simple woman, but a wIse one. There are young
children m the world who, hke your Rusa, have inside their
souls, a touch of SIlver. These young ones may sometImes
have sudden spells and lose themselves m theIr own ImaginatIons because of the power with which they are drawn by
their souls-forces Many mothers thmk that their sons or
young daughters are not rIght m the mmd and their hearts
are full of sorrow, espeCially If their stupid doctors tell
them that nothmg IS wrong and laugh at them Of course,
nothing IS wrong, but the child understands and senses
everythmg too early and too strongly 1D VISions. Sometimes
these VISIOns can make the child very happy, so happy m
fact, that he or she Will prefer to remaIn that way as long
as possible It IS good If the child IS left alone to be WIth hiS
SIlver-touched happmess Your Rusa IS a VISion-senSItive
grrl She IS lucky to be so Even though I have struggled
for so many years to Infuse the world With my colours and
my hard ImagmatlOn, I would gIVe anythmg to be like
Rusa, but I cannot be so I have to be content With
myself and my weak pIctures'
Somewhat exhausted by thIS long expOSItion, the old man
sat down and stared at hiS recently fiDlshed canvas Rusa,
who had been watchmg hiS hps move m artIculatIng the
words, sat on hiS knee, fingers of one hand m her mouth,
the other hand holdmg on to hiS beard for support. A
butterfly, large, yellow and mottled, caught her eye, and she
gazed at It untIl the small black dot on ItS wmg grew larger
and rounder then changed mto a huge field of deep purple
hke the sun when you look straight mto It With closed
eyes.
The old man ached for the mother, whose pamed eyes
told him that she had not absorbed much of what he had
saId Why IS It, he wondered, that such supremely gIfted
chIldren are born to plam, unsophistIcated people who, lU
their lack of Wider understandIng, would only suffer from
misplaced delUSIOns about the saUlty of theIr perfectly created sons and daughters, mortals given an extra slIce of the
richness and mfinlte sublimIty of thiS world.
