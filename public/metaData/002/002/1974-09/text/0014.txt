PEREGRINATIONS
From far and near they came IlTK's annual cultural
festival IS a kmd of Woodstock, only a httle more conventIOnal and orgamzed For those eight or ten colleges of
DeIhl, It IS an annual pllgnmage which begms wllh a
clamorous tram Journey to Kanpur This year I1TM also
jomed the bandwagon A hundred and twenty of us
(lOcludmg hangers-on from IITD) had crammed mto a
compartment for seventy-five (the chicks 10 the group never
had It so good). Somehow everyone got through mtact to
Kanpur.
Nice place, thiS IITK The Yanks have been as generous there as the Germans here The structures there, unhke ours are the work of architects. The campus Itself Isn't
a patch on ours and on those hot, dusty September mornmgs,
looked dreary and listless
WIlh the experience of eight years behmd them, the
orgaDisers had planned well and showed that they had
learnt theIr lessons well But on the tirst day the combmed
braIDS of IITM and I1TD beat their apparently foolproof
set·up 10 a cunous show of WitS Sorry, detaIls can't be
divulged here but everythmg ended up 10 good humour and
leVity In their anxiety to orgaDise well the IITK people
gave the whole show a lIttle too formal outlook.
There were none of those mUSical shows under the trees
as we had here for our Mardi Gras (they have plenty of
trees, mmd you). Everywhere there was thiS air of ngldlty
and formalIty In the mess, we were assigned tables and
subjected to scrutinY (there were plenty of hangers·on from
IITD) Tbe grub was more than Just edible but OlIver
couldn't ask for more Have you ever heard of anyone
pInmg for Saras or Narmada grub? It may seem Incredible but thiS was precIsely what Mahesh and AmI Gadl were
domg after the second day Back home thIngs weren't, after
all, that bad
The schedule was tight. Plays were staged late In the
evenmgs on three days and qUite a few were laudable
IIT-KGP came up WIth a long drawn out one (' Bandl')
which ended up as a test of patIence for the audIence
The best play was from Xavlers, Bombay ThiS play was
an expenment by the d,rector (can't recall hiS name) and as
It progressed It changed hiS Image from that of a commonplace pseudo-bram to that of a genume thlOker He projected
onto the play h's conceptIOn of lIfe as a game and depIcted
the many facets of man-woman relatIonships accord 109 to
that conception The same guy had won the 'Just a
mmute' contest at lITD a few days earlIer The whole
show was very ImpreSSIve mdeed but If we had staged
our play 'Luv' (rejected as late entry) we would have
matched the pnze wlODlng 'Theatre game'
Our qUIz team of Ramkumar and John Louis lost to
IITK, 14 POlQts to 24 ID the prelzmmary round, Lady

lZ

Sriram College of DeIhl, a Virtual onlooker, managed 4
pomts. IITK were good but 45 minutes IS too bnef a
span to qualIfy a qUIz as an accurate test of knowledge.
The bell saved lITK from us. DUrIng the qUIz Ramku
proved he could say If a palOtmg was done by Rembrandt
or not and LoUIS showed that he had taken last year's
psychology course serIously IlTK eventually won the final
round
The western musIc programme was good but the sultry
atmosphere of the pandal did It harm Mainly soft numbers were done and one sInger from IIT-KGP Impressed
everyone WIth hIS VIbrant vOIce Our guys, Eddie (WIth
hIS Woodstock numbers) and Randhlr Naldu were good
but one look at the field and you'll forgIve them for not
bnngIng home any prIzes
Randhlr had the misfortune
of beIng pre·empted to both the songs he had been so
well prepared WIth, by smgers before hIm He sang one
of them' One morDlng m May' and clearly e"celled hiS
predecessor
We found time to go around the InstItute Their
hbrary IS somethmg We learnt that theIr academiC programmes reqUIre a lot of hours of study In the hbrary.
Would you belIeve that III some subjects each student IS
Issued With a copy of the preSCrIbed text-book by the
lIbrary for the whole semester? IITK surely have the edge
over us III academiC matters and we have much to learn
from them There IS, of course, qUite a bit to theIr TV
Centre and the closed CirCUit network. The Computer
Centre looks much more ImpreSSive than ours and houses
five systems but when we were taken around It superctllIousness was WrItten all over us. Everywhere we heard
thIS tnbute to our IBM 370 system.
RavIChandra played for u, on the Veena III the IndIan
musIc (l1ght and claSSical) competition He is rea\1y good
but up north people couldn't tell the dlft'erence between a
veena and a sitar and poor Ravlchandra langUished 10
obscurIty. Even we weren't of much help to him The SIDgers chose thelT rendItIOns well.
In the elocution contest,Gadl,oursole representative, was
off color But he more than adequately made up for It ID
the extempore debate where hiS Wit earned him a round of
applause Mahesh for hIS part, analysed the tOpiC 'Life IS
absurd', well but the delIvery lacked Its usual punch. The
contest was a close one and the Judges had a difficult job
deCidIng, agamst us. The whole story repeated Itself for
the debate and we came out empty· handed The tOpiC
had somethmg to do With God, hIS house on earth,
people and stones
Now conung to the bterary events at lIT Delhi, Mahesh
did very well to finIsh thIrd ID the' Just a mInute' contest
(If you don't know what thiS IS, lIsten ID to the BBC) He
can score as well WIth hIS gab as WIth hiS bat. The wClter's
performance was medIOcre and he was ehmmated in the
prellmmary round. But Mahesh lost hIS touch ID the Mock
seSSIon (thIS IS a fClvolQUS b\lSlDesS whIch meaS\lres how

crazy one can get) and was lIterally carned out by 'arme?
men '. There IS not much to say about lITD except that It
has an ImpOSing Students' ActIVities Centre One wonders
why they don't wm the Inter·IIT meets
ThiS coverage IS for only half the penod of the tTlP, for,
the other half was spent In the tram We have returned
only to find ourselves ID the quagmire of perIodical tests,
labs ...

Mailer on Physics and Engineering
Conceive of a smner who IS a CatholIc and devout What
compleXity ID hIS feelmg for the Church, what pIetIes of
observance bve between hiS SIDS. He has to make such
Intncate shows of concealment to hiS damned habits. Yet
how Simple IS the Church's relation to hlIn. Extreme
Unchon Will dehver hiS soul from a Journey through hell
So It IS with phYSICS and englDeenng. PhYSICS IS the
church, and engmeenng the most devout smner. PhYSICS
IS the do maID of beauty, law, order, awe, and mystery of
the purest sort, engmeermg IS partIal observance of the
laws and puttenng With machmes which never work qUIte
as they should work; engIDeenng, hke acts of SID, IS the
process of proceedmg boldly mto complex and often forbidden matters about which one does not know enough-the
laws remalO to be elUCIdated-but the ellpenence of the past
and hunger for the taste of the new expenence attract one
forward So bndges were bUilt long before men could
perform the mathematIcs of the bendlDg moment.
