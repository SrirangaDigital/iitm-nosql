that it is somethmg worth encouragmg and If during any
year there IS a fall In VIsItors to KashmIr, everyone Involved IS
duly compensated for the loss that they may have mcurred
I smcerely hope that such mcentlves remam It IS not rare
to hear someone say that that partlcular shawl IS the
product of hIs father's labour The women, especlaJly
dunng monsoons and winter, also turn out some masterpIeces. Busy, busy, busy, IS the ImpreSSion one gets of the
people there. If not out m the fields, the women-folk are
mdoors weavlllg Obhvlous to the world outside theIr
socIal sphere, they work tIrelessly from dawn to dusk.
There are qUIte a few furners and taxlderrmsts domg theIr
bIt of damage.
The rest of the populace has found Its metter III agnculture As IS well known, KashmIr has a clImate best
sUIted for fruIts and flowers, In whIch It has a boornmg
export mdustry, the way to Yusmarg bemg bounded by vast
expanses of orchards Ideally, the frUIts burst forth 10
countless numbers m the months between August and
October, although some come out as early as June Like
old men, the trees hunch forward with the sheer weIght of
the frUIt that they bear. Don't try to be kmd and ease theIr
burden for If caught by the owners, you'll be left wondenng
what hit you. They wJll mvaflably bUIld a replIca of Mt.
Everest out of the mole-hIll you madvertantly made It's
second nature to them.
I would ascnbe the excellent health of these people not
only to the salubrIOUS chmate of KashmIr, but also to the
easy access they have to frUIts. These frUlts can supplement any diet and still be for the better. Healthy children
froItc With an energy hard to control, and everywhere one
sees VIvacIOUS kIds dartmg after one another. It does the
heart good to see that VICIssitudes have not reduced them
to creased brows and despaIr. For these lucky chIldren,
health and vltahty are as natural as lIfe Itself.
The men wear a tIght pyjama and a kurta, complemented
by lIght foot-wear, a cap (whIch affords no protection from
the heat) placed on top of the head and a little to the back, and
a sober-coloured overcoat Shepherds have foot-wear made
of straw tIed neatly In bunches, fibres bemg tied around the
ankle to keep the thmgumajlgs m place The men-folk have
fine features. Many of them sport a beard and many others
have a lIght stubble The women dress m bnghtly coloured
(and sometimes gansh) clothes Bemg faIr of compleXIOn,
It is very rarely that one sees a woman With heavIly apphed
cosmettcs. Their fresh, natural beauty renounces the need
for any rouge or mascara and the like Bangles. anklets
and trmkets are very commonly used Some of the women
stIlI remam behmd the' purdah' and m black robes But
KashmIr too seems to be dlscardmg old tradItIons It was
not uncommon to see a segregatIon of women slttmg m the
gardens hsteOlng to 140 db musIc WIth their purdahs removed from theIr faces. The children too dress gaily, but
theIr chatter and mnocent stares make them so lovable;
whereas I would have warded off a man, I let these sweet

kIds Sidle upto me and examine my camera. After being
subjected to close scrutmy I would watch them laughIngly
run off to spread the word. I didn't see a smgle kid come
forward to beg
The vendors have a prodIgIOUS capacIty for bemg mendaCIous and their honoroficlcablhtudmhahbus IS always III
questton Where purcha.mg IS concerned, I C1n safely
asseverate that any commodity bought by you would be
worth at least half the price paId. Once you have been
dIscreetly SIzed up as well-to-do, they Will tenacIously chng
to you It's so hard to turn them down once you see their
upturned' mnocent' faces As much as a gllmpse IS enough
to unsettle you, so Just close your eyes and bark at them to
vamoose, or else.
Pahalgam, the Valley of Shepherds, too had something in
store It had one of those regular mSlstent sellers, but With
a difference ThiS time It was a medlcme-man. Whether I
should call hIm a petty doctor or brand hIm a quack IS left
to the reader's discretIOn Anyway, thIS old chap gave me
a little 011 He asked me to gently rub It on my temple and
to simultaneously tWiddle my toes. I must have looked a
weIrd Sight and I studIOusly aVOIded the cunous gaze of the
tickled audience ThiS extraordmary man claImed that the
same oIl would find Its way out of the feet where a healthy
person was concerned but would be occluded somewhere
along the body m the case of an mhng one. Imag11le my
astoDlshment, and rehef, when 011 actually dId come out
from my foot. Here I do not wish to accentuate my good
health but the fact that 011 whizzed from head to foot!
Tnumphantly (at hav11lg demonstrated hiS powers?) he held
up the od imprmt on paper bllt sadly said that I was healthy
enough and that none of hiS (expensive 1) medlcmal concoctions were necessary. Was It only a trick 1 I don't know,
but I wonder how many bought hIS medlcmes out of sheer
pallic. The spectahty of yet another was to rub 011 on the
palm and' make It ' come out from the back of the hand.
Wonder what they'll do next WIth the bally 011.
Saffron, or Kaysar IS also cultIVated m plenty m Kashmlf.
But beware I Kaysar is of two types One variety IS called
• Mongra' and the other IS called 'Lacha'. The flower
from which saffron IS extracted has five petals Four are
yellow m colour and one IS red It IS the red part that IS
plucked out and used 10 the maklOg of saffron. ObVIOusly
thIS IS pure saffron. Most enterpnsmg people give the
yellow petals a red hue. ThiS IS then mixed With the pure
form Thus one flower YIelds one umt of mongra or five
UDitS of lacha and hence a neat 400% profit. Pampore has
a climate best SUIted for the cultIvation of saffron.
KashmIr comprIses three districts One ofthem,Snnagar,
IS the capital. The prevIOus capital was Avanhpore, but
now It IS a neglected place With a dilapidated temple as Its
only showpIece. BUIlt m the Pallava times, It has an
mdeclpherable wrItmg on some stones. Which shows how
good the Pallava code was.
Strangely enough people In Kashmir do not bother to

, pasteurise' the water before drinkmg It At first I would
very gmgerly apply my hps to a glass of water, but findmg
It apparently safe I overcame my InitIal mhlbltJons. Perhaps
It IS better not to boll the mlneral-nch water; the depositIOn of carbonates on the vessel bemg stili more undeSIrable.
So much for chemistry.
What about SrlOagar? We made It our base because of
its advantages It \Jes at the most central place. Pahalgam.
Gulmarg etc Ite 10 completely different dIrections and each
IS accessable only via Snnagar I was one day cornered by
a person from AIR Srmagar, and to the blase lIstener I gave
my ImpreSSIOns of the wonderful place
We travelled WIdely and saw as much of Kashmir as we
pOSSibly could. IneVItably, the place IS becommg less of a
ParadIse as far as escapists are concerned TOUrIsm is
rapidly expandlOg and human proliferation taking ItS toll of
wlld-hfe. But vestiges of bhss stIli remaIn to attract everyone in search of beauty and that rare commodity called
Peace of Mmd.
A smkmg heart and an ascendmg alfcraft SImultaneously
left that glonous place The former was mSlde me, and I
was InSide the latter •.. bound for Deihl.

In doubt to deem himself a god or beast;
