On Pressure Cookers
The court bUlldmg stood massive and frownmg; It was
an ugly red, rather an mtermedlate colour, neIther truly red
nor truly orange, a half breed of dubiOUS parentage
Hardly had I entered this bUlldmg than I was pounced upon
by a scrawny little man wIth a baldmg head, resembling a
hI-dome pressure cooker I was uneastly shuffling my feet
about, It was my first VISit, you know, and I was as nervous
as a young bnde on her honeymoon I was also remmded
of the nch, tltled Englishman, who anxIous to bag a tIger on
his first safan, broke out IOta a cold sweat at the first snap
of a tWig aud shoutmg tIger fired at every smgle movmg
object until the exasperated mahout was forced to knock our
klllght of the garter on the head to prevent hIm from shooting hImself m hIS excItement AIlYEhmg remotely smelling
of the law Increases my pulse rate and thIs specImen remmded me of some vague character I had come across 10 one
of those 'Inspector goes West, East, North or South'
stones
I am sorry I have strayed This IS a common falling
of most wnters After all, how else can you fill up
600 pages-you have a character 10 mmd, hiS character
unfolds, and then rather belatedly you thmk of hiS aunt
and then of her lover dead since 10 years, whose feet she
hears treadmg the path outsIde her wmdow even today
and there are policemen, a clan depIcted as nmcompoops and good-natured Idiots and vanous characters
and poor relatIOns who drop by once 10 a way to speak
somethmg mane and get bashed up by the vtllams
for theIr palOS These vlllams of course, are large,
massIve and ugly, With long deep scars runlllng aU
over them; their noses are usually crooked, their eyes glassy
and flecked WIth yel1ow, theIr teeth broken, stained and
numbenng tWIce thIrty-two; If only they had red hOins and
a mouth belching fire they could qualify as LUCifer's
lieutenants
Well, thIS hi-dome, on seeIng that I was In trouble, rubbed
hIS hands In glee, knowmg he had landed a sucker_
'You want to see somebody, SIr?', he asked Startled
by thIS unexpected cordlaltty I told hIm I wanted to see
a first-class magIstrate He pursed hIS hps In surpnse and
cluc1ced sympathetICally He looked so sad that I wanted
to pat hIm on the head and gIve hIm a feedmg bottle.
• Well, you see, SIr, that's 'mposslble Before you see the
first class magIstrate, you have to go through the doorman,
the clerk, the local lawyer, the P A and finally, If you
have survIved these obstacles, you come to the great man
hImself'
MeetlOg god would be eaSIer, I thought It was now my
20

turn to look sadly at hi-dome In fact both of us would have
put our arms around each other and CrIed our hearts
out. 'But Sir, I have an Idea' The 'un started shmlng
agam, the mists rolled away and I looked at hIm hopefully
He led me aSIde, WInked at me broadly and suggested we
have a cup of tea With a fflend of hIS Not a bad Idea actually, a tea IS welcome at any hme of the day, but I had a
sneaking suspICIon that my pockets would be consIderably
lighter after thIS tea
• Does the magIstrate come to thIS place?' I asked mno:
cently HI-dome gave me a scorching stare and I swallowed
hastily and looked suffiCIently apologetic
Well we walked up to thiS tea-waHah and on the way my
compamon smIled at me slyly and saId 'May be I can help
you' I looked at hIm happIly and gave hIm a resounding
slap on the back HI-dome tottered and blew steam WIth the
typIcal low speed Jet nOise announcing that nee was
ready
He sneezed so hard that a one-eyed crow
feedIng IOnocently on the remnants of a stlOklOg rat
uttered a screeching cackle and flew straIght IOta the wall.
It took me qUite a few mmutes to calm down Pressure
Cooker, he was about to burst HIS fflend JOlOed us at the
tea stall and there was a long dialogue on htlgatlons and of
a case where a woman was sUIng her husband for refllslOg to
support her because she wa, pregnant: she mSlsted the
baby was hiS, he IOslsted It was not and stupIdly enough
told her he was sleeplOg WIth somebody else, whereupon
madame exploded with fury and clawed one of hiS eyes out
while finng away the most superlative and hIghly descnptlve expletives whIch adorn the Tamil language, thIS gave
the one-eyed husband two causes to sue her back, one for
assault and the other for trymg to can hIm IOto behevlOg the
child was hIS, for now the woman, havmg spent all her energy
no longer insisted the child was hIS and was further unable
to name the probable husband. ThiS was related III great
detall by my two fnends untIl roy ears were slllgmg and I
was forced to beg them to stop and dnnk theIr teas
, About the magistrate', I began, and my fnends turned
around to look at me The newcomer was dressed III
lawyer's clothes, white pants and a black coat and looked
officIOUS. He looked down solemnly at me WIth hIS spectacles on hIS nose, and hIS eyes above It_
'Well, young man, what do you want?' I asked hIm and
gave hIm the form expecting hIm to sIgn It so that I could go_
He looked over It upSide down and then saId III an unctuous tone, 'You know courts IIlvolve expenditure' and he
looked hungnly at me HI-dame's mouth was slavenng;
both of them were ready to clean up the shop. I am very

slow on the uptake but even my mouse-bralO could bandle
thiS wavelength_ I slowly pushed the chaIr back ready to
spnnt 'It WII\ cost fifteen rupees; records must be mamtamed, offiCial stamp has to be Issued, and then the
magIstrate WIU sIgn' It seemed !Ike the ratlficatlon of the
Simla pact
, But I don't have that much money.' HI-dome looked
at me fiercely Somethmg had gone wrong WIth hiS plan. I
had looked a nch sucker and here I was cflbbmg about a
measly fifteen rupees_ The Oily bastard was gIVIng HI-dome
an even tougher look. We were all set to explode when HIdome gasped' How much money have you I'
, None, you - ' and I uttered one of those lovely Tamil
words whIch HI-dome had used ten mmutes back I grabbed the form from the other crook's hand and thumped
HI-dome on the back with all my mIght ThIS time he
took off and hit the ceilmg HIS sneeze broke a few cups
and saucers and caused a mmor earthquake A few tiles
slid off the roof and crashed and the Irate owner grabbed a
kitchen klllfe and advanced menaCingly towards HI-dome
In the general confUSIon I aimed a hearty kick at the other
rascal's shm and bolted from the scene
