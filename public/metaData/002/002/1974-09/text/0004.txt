Reflections of an

It IS with reluctance that I am putting down the following
remarks on paper It IS not that the Ideas are revolutIOnary
and would result In my getting the sack should someone
• higher up , read It Far from It, they would seem almost
commonplace truisms. The reluctance stems from my
experience With the expressIOn of Ideas and words m our
country: qUite mdependently of their ment, no action
follows, nothmg constructive IS done Perhaps I am sangume m eXpressing the hope that at least some of the
readers of thIs magazine wIll ponder over these Ideas and do
somethmg.
QUIte dehberately, I Wish to restnct myself to three
problems m the academiC environment at lIT. ThiS IS
not because they are the most Important by a long shot,
but because I have thought about them for a long tIme
and am mvolved With them directly. It turns out too, that
1 can suggest solutions to these problems which from my
direct, personal experience, are found to work There has
been much talk here m India and abroad of the relevance of
what IS taught at the UnIVerSity to bfe. The question IS a
complIcated one, as no easy interpretatIon of the word
relevance eXists Further, what IS not relevant today might
be mtensely relevant tomorrow. I am not Interested ID the
question 10 thiS general form. I Wish to ask, are all thIDgS
taught to B Tech. students (for example) at the lIT
necessarIly equally Important or IS there a subset of • core'
subjects Which IS CrItically Important, the rest mere
• paddmg' 1 The reason I Wish to ask thiS questlOn (I must
remmd you that I am askIDg as the teacher of one of these
subjects) IS tbat, I feel personally (many of my colleagues
would appear to disagree With my view) that the course IS
seriously overloaded. ThiS overloadlDg means that some SIX
to eight subjects are taught per semester and tbe students
are expected to work (m the classes and the labs) for
somethmg hke forty hours per week. It IS my conSidered
opmlOn that no student should be allowed to study more than
five courses per semester and the total number of hours
(mcludmg labs.) shOUld not exceed thirty Almost all
sCientific and englOeenng subjects require a lot of IOdependent thought, diSCUSSIOn With others, and the workwg out
of problems. I have been prIvileged to study at Cal Tech.
where even more strIngent restnctlons on the work load
are Imposed and 1 have not noticed that a typical Cal
Tech. B.S. IS less able to cope With an engmeerIng problem

than a tYPical lIT student. This must mean that large
portIOns of the courses must be Irrelevant or readily available mformatlOn which the students can be tramed to look
up for themselves IOstead ofgrlOdtng them for mtermtnable
hours m the classrooms. We can hardly expect any qualItative Improvement unless thiS overloading problem IS
honestly tackled by the Faculty By reducmg the number
of courses one can make serIOUS eft'orts to Impart tnstructlOn
on the core subjects on a non-trIvial level by makmg the
students self-rehant and more confident in their abilIty to
solve problems.
The second problem I WISh to discuss IS the question of
attendance. I wish to question the proposition that
the UnIversity IS responsible to the parents of students
m the matter of attendance In classes. The students
must be treated as responsible adults (whether they
are or are not) and must take the consequences of being
lfresponsible. As a student I have always felt that attendance was a meanlDgless tyranny, and as a sta1f-member.
I feel that It IS a meanIngless waste of time If a student
can do what is expected of him (b.omework, examlOatlOns)
Without a teacher's help, why shouldn't he? Further, a
captIve audience IS not the one best SUited to effiCIent commUDlcatlon of tecb.mcal lOformatlOn Let me qualify my
disapproval of the present antedeluvlan attendance system by
saytng that at labs or workshops, the work cannot be done
Without the phYSical presence of the student at the appomted hour. Here, of course, attendance IS essentIal for the
work to be completed. To stop a student from gettmg a
degree because he • does not have the attendance' IS
unacademiC and unbecommg of a UnIversity.
The final problem IS less speCific. It has to do With
the • miasma '. We appear to have a rotten' miasma'
here at lIT. The students distrust teachers and the teacher;
are IndIfferent and InSenSItIVe to students and dIstruSt each
other. As If thiS were not enough, the staff and the
admlDlstratlOn are constantly at each other I have reframed
throughout from sayIDg , when I was a student here, It was
better' because In the maIO, It wasn't However, It certainly
wasn't worse. ThiS constant questionIng of the other
man's bonafides, thiS loud and cacaphonous dissent, thiS
total dlsmclmatlon to work seems to be a deep. seated
malady. The question 15, can we collectively, as members
of the lIT commumty, do somethIng about It?

To even begIn thlOkmg about thiS problem, everyone
must deCide clearly what he wants The students must
deCIde whether they Just want the degree or want to learn
useful thmgs In the course of gettmg one and learn to enJoy
dOIng useful thlOgs. The Faculty members must ask themselves whether they are defiCient In some respects, teachlOg
or research or Just general sense of humour If, of course,
they tell themselves tbat they are perfect, nothmg more IS
to be said, except perhaps they could ask themselves If
they are honest The staff and administratIOn must dady
remmd themselves that the baSIC reason for the eXIstence
of the U Diversity and therefore themselves IS the bUSIness
of educatmg students A questIOn which we must all ask
ourselves IS how m the world are we Justified In wastIng
tax-payers' (our own!) money and above all lIme In
perpetratmg the mIllion IneffiCienCies we do perpetrate
every day. What we do seem to be pretty good at IS asking
these questions With reference to others ThiS crUCial
difference IS responsible for the miasma
Suppose m~tead, we recognIzed our own hmltatlOns and
extended the same tolerance of ourselves to others, we
might even be able to talk to each other courteously If we
can for a moment reflect that another'~ mterest need not
necessarIly be agamst self-mterest, a meanIngful dialogue IS
pOSSible. Unfortunately everyone takes himself very
senously and cannot spare a thought for hiS human -or
natural environment The only remedy I can sugge!;t IS that
every member of the lIT community be given courses of
humourous readIng begIn Ding with a study ofP G Wodehouse It might be objected that laughter IS IncompatIble
With the' High SOCial Purposive Senou!;ness ' which IS caned
for m these difficult tImes I thmk thiS IS better than the
students gIVIng their famous ImitatIOn of sheep, the faculty
of a snarhng pack of wolves, the staft' of a squalhng baby
and the adminIstratIOn of a block of wood.
