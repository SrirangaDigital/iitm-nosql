thlllg is as it was when bUilt, except that Shah lehan, the soil
of Jebangir, later added one more structure to It. As IS
typical of all gardens buIlt by the Mughals, this one too has
mnumerable fountams to bathe the many flowers
In thiS lovely settmg, we saw the son-et-lumlere which
told of an episode m the lIfe of the two lovers; of their
quarrel and reconcIlIation. That we saw both, the Urdu and
the Enghsh shows, speaks amply of the mterest generated.
Chashme Shahl. or The Spring of the KIDgS, IS another
place of mterest. In bygone days, the kmgs had a partIcular
spot reserved exclusively for themselves from where they
drew their drmkmg water and here, a garden and a monument have grown up. What makes the water fit to be drunk
by kmgs IS ItS apparently beneficIal dlgeshve propertIes for
which I can personally vouch' havmg eaten hke a gourmand
after shanng the pnvlleges of royalty.
Gulmarg, or 'The Flower Valley' IS at a shiVer-mducing
altitude of approximately 9000 ft. above sea-level. It IS
about 60 miles from Srmagar, our base, and about 10 miles
from Tangmarg An apt name because It IS from here that
the road narrows down. Whereas the road upto Tangmarg
has a standIng chmb, after that It IS a Journey Into space
One can go Up m anvthmg that moves on wheels or on
pornes. My adVice IS never to take the latter: It means
askIng the Almtghty for an mfirnte hmlt of tolerance.
In spIte of Its tremendous heIght, Gulmarg was surpnsmgly warm, but the weather there IS saId to be notoriously
unpredIctable. Gulmarg has a 1 km. rope-way system, but
whereas In the AIps, closed cars ghde on ropes, here we have
chairs for two, danghng precanously 45-50 ft. above rocky
terram. The occaSional shudders of the snati-pace chairs
have, I am conVInced, appreCIably reduced my hfe span.
The people of Kashmir are predominantly MuslIm. A
beard that I then sported often deceived people who mIstook
me for a Mushm and a caust!c-Iookmg specImen cautIOusly
enqUired whether I was one. A reply ID the affirmatIve saw

questIoned rum as to the whereabouts of the border, whereupon, assummg that I was mtendmg to head out of town,

ponderance and we deCIded to leave the very next day as I

snow, he Insisted that warm clothes weren't necessary
whereas I lDslsted that they were. Well, folks, came morn
and that was the last he saw of me!
The people here hve ID abject poverty. Standards of
hVIDg remalD as they were 27 years ago, but the people seem
bhssfully unaware of the changmg world outSide. Kashml!
