WILL SCIENCE PROJECfS
RECEIVE TRUE SUPPORT?

CELLATAR,IAS

Staff Opinion
(Note. I chanced on this letter down
Ta.ramani way. As it was addressed to • The
Editar, Campus Times', here you are.

Sir,
Tnere has been a long felt need for a joint
where one could force one's heavy eyelids
open with a cup of coffee and possibly a fag.
This need is accentuated on Periodical nights.
Those of us who never open a text-book till
the last minute, (and conveniently cog any
tuts) can't survive without the 10 p.m. coffee.

A.

AU good things come in pairs. So do these
cafetarias-I beg your pardon, cellartarias. As
it stands, they provide healthy competition to
each other. It does good to those who run
these canteens-there I go again-these cellartarias, but it sure is a one-way street for your
pocket-money. I know of a guy, who was
saving up to buy a do-it-yourself radio kit.
Now he has given it up as a lost cause. His
new hobby is to stuff himself up with icecreams and the like. Well every cloud has its
silver linning. This guy's neighbour heaved a
sigh of relief and chaps now cling to our hero
like barnacles to a ship's huU.

I has given correct ansers here but when
you publis please do it questions one page
ansurs other page. then only crosswords is
intrusting. it is e'len more eggsiting if you
ate giving rupees also to peepul who solves
it. another things intrusting magajinis has
is detuktiv and he-man stories. you must
at least have serial story of M.G.R. fighting
the villano but always M.G.R. must win.
pliss take my ideas seriusly. yous knows that
I will be taking you in totorials and if you
are publissing 1 nos. of my storeC3 I will be
reely gradeful.
Yours,

One of the bigwigs around here commented
that a central canteen in a separate building,
run on co-operative basis by the students is
to be considered. Well, till then let these two
forerunners carry the hanner.
I suggest to the authorities that no m[)re
canteens he allowed in the hostels. Otherwise
there will be a rash of this species which will
do nobody any good.
It is said that a goat will starve if two identical piles of grass are left at equal distance
from it. 1 believe there is a-sizeable number
of fellows in Godavari and Saraswathi, who
are yet to visit either of the coffee-bars-I
mean ( CELLATARIAS '.

Yours truly,

Dear editar Saar,
. after much thoughting it over in the past
times and much thinking it over in the
present times 1 has concluded that you are
very parshul. you always publiss articles by
students but never by us lectururs, I has
writted many thrillingly stories, and luv
st()ries detuktiv also. Still you are not
pubHssing not even one. then why for you
are printing even potry by paramesuar and
all? at least you must have decensy to give
our reedurs lots of cross wor-ds puzles. hence
is one I have made all by myself.

Sir,
Two years ago, an IITian successfully completing a project for the Annual Science Fair
received only a pat on the back or, Worse
still, a typed-out certificate. If some modelbuilders have survived t it is entirely due to
their determination.
lIT would make a significant move if it
offered awards other than certificates or ornamental brass-ware. The awards should include
slide rules, cash prizes, sets of books, and
scholarships. J1?e IIT's offer the highest
number of scholarships in the country. It
wouLd be in line to reserve a place or two in
the scholarship list for proficiency in science
project work.
The writer feels that the people who can
bring into effect these suggestions will hardly
even read through this. Even if they do so,
they'd probably~ sigh overit and say, , here's
another one.' There's a lot of hope, though.

VARIETY
Dear Editor,

Campastt1UoS could be a magazine of liT.
written by IITians t for IITians. etc., but that
does not in any way mean that the topics
on which the various contributo.rs write
should be strictly IITian. Not that I object
to these articles; only, I do not want the
magazine to be too dependent on them. In
the years I have been in IlT. almost all the
issues of Catnpastimes have been full of the
same type of articles on the same topics.
By now, I feel, enough has been said about
Gajendra Circle, Periodicals and the old and
new Ladies' Hostel. It is time we are provided
with a different fare. Not because we cannot
write more about the same topics, but because
variety is the spice of life.
Yours, etc ••
