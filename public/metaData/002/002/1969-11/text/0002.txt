PRESS HUWOUR
Is humour most effective when it is unintention~l? The newspapers form an ample
source for research. on this subject. Take a look, for instance, at the two cuttings shown here.
In the one headlined
• Sports', the minister
seems to have turned
all poetic, comparing
education to some kind
of modella fabric and
sports to women in
such a robe.
And the second cutting .•• well, the news
itself is just plain
funny.
