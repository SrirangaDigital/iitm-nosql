One of the points stressed this 'year, participation, started off very ...~e!l rwht. at the
Inaugural Function. If partlClpatlOn IS ~o. be
"Something tangible rather than JUs; a politi.cal
slogan, everyone mus~ .~ave hot u"!formatlOll
concerning all the aCtiVLtles. In th15 respect,
Campastimes is 110t very useful: and the
bringing in of Spotlight was defimt;ly ~leces­
·sary. (I'm writing this at the begmnm~ of
October-just see when you get to road It.)

Elections
Election time, as cvel'y?ne kt~.o\n, is j!lst
-fine for renewing old fncndshlps, startmg
llew ones, looking up your nu~sery school p~ls.
rediscovering long lost relatIves and yakkmg
-away in all the languages you ever learnt.

If the members of a committee feel like it,
they can co-opt one or t\Vo interested persons.
An advantage of this would be that some
cupable people W]lO don't like to go tlll'ougb
the taxing ritual of elections could easily be
pulled in.
This business of co-option would make
elections less importunt, since getting in
would be 110 probletn--all one would have
to do would be to display a little interest and
Hbility in that line instead of gamblin& on
cokes, cigarettes and transport (cars, bikes,
walking sticks ••. ).
With elections made less important, the
100% glamour boys would drift away to other
fields and one is Sure that II lot more would be
tioDe besides putting in an appearance evcl'Y
time there is a tea. (I'll bet that there are
blokes who haven't even seen the other
members of their committee I)
An example of a nominated committct'
which has been getting along reasonably well
is the Board of Editors of Campastimes. No
doubt it is possible to make out that the
bonds between the yariolls members have
not beel\ formed e::.:clusively by a common
jouma1istic interest--and you do find old
acquaintances, alter egos, back seat wallahs,
namesakes, relatives and the like, but the set
seem to be getting on alright.
Another non-elected grpup making out fine
is the Skating Club. After a couple of shaky

l'ating' to come fol' something Of the other.
Couldn't they just ask those who would I like
to come'? We find that the hostels are being
called I halls of l'csidence'! This requires a
terrific degree of pompousness together with
II completc ig:norancc of facts. Even the
most fantastid imagination could not think of
these disjointed chunks of concrete cnclosing
an assortment of weeds and lizards as halls !
We donlt even have the sanction of long
usoge; can you possibly think of - - - - Hall or - - - - - - Hall ?---priso1l would be
nearer the mark.

I dOll't think it possible for anyone to
reside in this ploce. The subsistence diet,
the poky little cubbyholes which pasS for
r.ooms, the uncouth attenders and the blood-,
thirsty mosquitos dOll't quite fit into the ideal
picture of a l'esidence. We can say with ·con~
fidence that our worthy neighbour, the·
Governor, resides; we can say that the boolts
ill our shelves, borrowed in the first year;
reside; that the occupants of Gajendra Circle
reside and the numerous sleep-walkers in the
departments reside. nut US? Im})ossible I
At this rate things would get so stuffy that
you'd never be able to say b-s to it aU.
You'd have .to use something elegant like
sphere,. That cel'tainly would please those
men up in Olympus, Neyer mind-Spltm'e,
to them!

turns and sudden bumps, the Club, like its
members, is rolling along comfortably on its
own feet. And that's pretty difficult if you
have skates on !

The Piano
Election Rations

Everyone is friendly, you find people ~ho
laugh at your wise-cracks, and the varlo.us
·soft drinks manufacturers have a marked flse
ill tneir sales.
Unfortunately, this blissful
state doesn't last for ever--the snag is that
·some people get in and ot11ers don't. Both
-these results may create difficulties.

Suckers for vote

IlT seems to be famous for things like the
Gajendra Circle, the Swimming Pool. the
Convocation, the Mike System, and the Piano.
The last named object is at this moment in
gl'avc danger of being struck off the list.
Some brilliant morons actually recognized
it is a musical instrument, a task requiring
a high. degree of creative ingenuity consider~
ing the condition the object was in.
Not satisfied \vith identifying this rare con~
traption, they've taken on the job of getting
it fixed a1Zd maintained, Due respect was
given to the aristrocratic Gel'man ancestry
of the piano by moving it out of the hot
sun--the resting place reserved exclusively
for mad dogs and Englishmen. Even· the
water shortage was considered when the piano
was shifted: in its new positioll, it doesn't
prevent even one drop of rain water from
reaching the thirst soil. A full-time dentist
has been appointed to check its teeth everytime anyone above a mosquito\veight boxer
comes for a workout. At this rate we might
actually get to hear George Verghese 011 the
ancient crate instead of being told about his
achievements outside lIT.

As soon as the elections are oV"er, we come
·across a thing called the post election fadeout.
·'rhis generally applies to the runners-up for
the posts at all levels. The trouble with this
is that the talents of these persons aren't
seen as much as they might be. There is
also the danger of interested observers feeling
obliged to act as if differences existed between the main participants in an election,
-creating their own merry gangs, and making
it tough for these blokes to work comfortably
together. Winners fadeout too; mainly when
an election becomes a matter of prestige
rather than just a glorified elimination process·
for catching hold of some fish to spare around
for you.
