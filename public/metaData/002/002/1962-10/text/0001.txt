A thousand years from'now, a historian,

surveying the history of India from its
ancient pas‘t, might pick out not more than
half a dozen names of individuals who stand
out head over shoulders over their contempo—
raries for outstanding merit in making life
a little more human and meaningful than it
had ever been before in Indian life. When
we are dead and gone, and sink into oblivion,
hardly remembered by posterity even by the
names we hear, the name of Mahatma Gandhi
will still be remembered and sung by millions
as one of India’s greatest saviours. While
the inﬂuence of the Buddha has been far
more enduring in international life and
thought for over 2500 years, no man, in his
own lifetime, was followed by more millions

of human beings than was Mahatma Gandhi.
When all our names, and practically, the
names of all the contemporaries of Gandhiji
are forgotten, even then, the one name that
will be remembered in Indian history by the
future generations of the world will be that
of Mahatma Gandhi.
Mahatma Gandhi has attempted and
achieved many things in his lifetime. He
has been the greatest single force in our
national life, and even after his death, his
enduring inﬂuence over the people has been
far more overwhelming than that of most
of our living leaders. He lived to see, unlike
most of the leaders who attempt great things
and strive for great objectives, the independ:
ence of India although it brought in its trail
the tragic Partition of the country. His
Autobiography in spotless simple style will
ever remain a unique contribution to
English literature. His writings and speeches covering a large variety of interests
and ﬁelds will continue to be a great fund
of knowledge for our research scholars to
delve into. Some of his sayings and statements are quoted from one end of the
country to the other. The Harijan uplift
programme has undone the two thousand
years of social wrong. The Khadi movement has taken deep roots in India. Though
it does not command the same devotion and
respect that it once did, even from an
employment point of view, it has been a
source of help to tens of thousands of spinners an
weavers. The sympathy and
understanding he consistently extended to
mill workers in particular and workers in
general have strengthened the trade union
movement in this vast continent. He preached a new day for workers and peasants.
The Satyagraha movements that he
initiated awakened the political and social
consciousness unknown before in Indian
history. Mahatma Gandhi was the ﬁrst man
to take politics to the doors of the common
man. The epic fasts that he undertook in
times of great strain and stress stirred the
conscience of India as nothing else had done
before. The village uplift programme and
the development of cottage industries have
come to stay on the Indian soil. Our
educational set-up is more and more tending
towards the principles of basic education that

Civilization, in the real sense of the term,

consists not in the multiplication, but in the
deliberate and voluntary reduction of wants.
This alone promotesreal happiness and contentment, and increases the capacity for service.

It is my ﬁrm conviction that no man loses
his freedom except through his own
weakness.

He cannot sleep, he cannot rest in peace,

He roused an ancient from slumber deep,
Fought a race that ruled the mighty seas,
And oft did disturb our guilty sleep.

Prince, peasant and all to their feet did leap,
Rubbed their eyes and breathed afresh
with him,

His glance took them all in a mighty sweep
The_frail sage spoke in accents clear and
grlm

God travels at a snail’s pace. Those who
want to do good are not selﬁsh, they are
not in a hurry, they know that to impregnate
people with good requires a long time.

A sea of men ﬂowed out in endless stream
To unchain our Mother; her eyes grew

With tears that rolled down in an endless

God turns His back on those who quarrel
