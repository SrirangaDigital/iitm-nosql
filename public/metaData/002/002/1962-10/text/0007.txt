THIS WORLD THIS
MONTH
Bringing to you the principal events
that have occurred in this wide warld—~
beyond the dense forest in the midst of
which you live—in the month ending
September
30th,
1962—the newert
of the new series of regular feature: pre—
rented to you by ‘ Campastimes ’.
1. Chinese forces intruded further into
Indian territory and opened ﬁre, September
20, on Indian personnel. Exchange of ﬁre
took place for the next three days. Indian
forces repelled another Chinese attempt to
overwhelm the auxiliary Chinese post near
Chejao bridge but the attack was repulsed
after a heavy exchange of ﬁre. Prime Minister
Nehru said in Lagos (Nigeria) that India
would meet with force any attempt by
China to acquire part of north-eastern India.
2. The controversial Chief Minister of
Kerala, Mr. Pattom Thanu Pillai was appointed Governor of the Punjab, September
25, following the decision of Mr. K. -.
Reddi to continue in his membership of the
Lok Sabha. Mr. R. Sankar was sworn in as
Chief Minister of Kerala, September 26.
Leaders of the Praja Socialist Party criticized
Mr. Pillai for not even having consulted
them before having accepted the Governorship. It may be recalled that the Congress-P5P coalition in Kerala had been in
doldrums for a long time. This move on the
part of the Central Government is expected
to give some life to it.
3. Mr. Ahmed Ben Bella was named
Prime Minister of the ﬁrst Government of
the Algerian Republic after the people of
Algeria had given a thumping majority to his
supporters in the general elections. He
secured 14.1 votes. He was the only candidate. Thirty-one blank or invalid votes were
cast. Mr. Ferhat Abbas was elected Presi—
dent of the Algerian Constituent Assembly
by securing 155 votes out of 191.
4. The Commonwealth Prime Ministers
managed to issue a communique at the end
of their Conference, avoiding any controversy
over Britain’s entry into the ECM. Prime
Minister Nehru proceeded to Nigeria, after
cancelling his visit to Ghana. ‘There he had
talks with the Nigerian Prime Minister, Sir Abubakar Tafawa Balewa.
5. The Yemenite army, equipped with
Soviet tanks and military equipment, revolted
against the new Imam of Yemen, September
27. The new Imam had succeeded his antiNasser father who died a week prior to the
revolt. It may be recalled that the Yemen broke
away from the United Arab States due to
differences with Presidenthasser. As we go to
Press, reports suggest that the revolutionaries
are well in control of this little Arabnation.
6. Sonny Liston scored a sensational ﬁrstround knock-out victory over Floyd Patterson
to become the new heavy weight champion of
the world. The ﬁght was over in two
minutes and six seconds. But I am sure none
wouldmind being in Patterson’s place, because
he was paid at the fantastic rate of $15,880 per
second for the ﬁght that he lost.
7. The Government of India have decided
to set up a new Institute for Higher Techno—
logical studies in Hyderabad. The Institute
shall be set up with foreign aid. There are
already four such Institutes—in Kharagpur,
Bombay, Madras and Kanpur.
