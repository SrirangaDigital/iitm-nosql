City Students’ Conference &
Presidency College Seminar
Athree-day conference on ‘Students and
National Integration, was held at St. Thomas
Hall, Madras Christian College, Tambaram,
under the auspices of the Y.M.C.A. Dr. Klein,
Jochen Haug, S. Gopalakrishnan, B. R. Pai,
S. A. Aleem, and the author represented the
Institute at the Conference.
It was, indeed, a most rewarding and thought
stimulating experience. Among the highlights
of the Conference was the key-note address by
Dru S. Chandrasekhar, Director, Indian In—
stitute of population studies. He held us
spell-bound for over an hour with his sharp
wit, scintillating humour and revolutionary
ideas. Earlier Mr. S. Chellapandian, speaker,
Madras Legislative Assembly, delivered the
inaugural address. We were also addressed
by Dr. Chandran Devanesan, Principal,
M.C.C., and Rev. Fr. Sequira, Principal,
Loyola College. All the speakers combined
to give us ample food for thought and open
out new vistas for our group Discussions.
We were sixty delegates, including ten girls.
ﬁve groups were formed under the leadership
of a Resource Person who was a member of
staff. Each group selected its Chairman and
Recording Secretary.
During the course of Saturday the 29th we
had three group Discussions lasting an hour
and a half each. Each group discussed the same
questionnaire. Among the many interesting
questions discussed were those on Hindi as
the national language and the extent to which
Inter-caste Inter-State and Inter-religious
marriages could help in National Integration.
Our group, for instance, decided that Intercaste and Inter-state marriages should be
encouraged and a bill passed to protect the
inheritance rights of the Children even if they
married outside their caste or State against the
wishes of their parents.
Among the ways Suggested to achieve
National Integration were: the formation of
National Institutes on the IIT pattern for
all courses of study; the forgetting of caste;
translation of literature of one language into
another;

promotion

of

internal

> (a) To develop the faculty of speech and
expression.
(17) To enable the delegates to dispassion—
ater discuss various subjects.
(c) To enable students from various
Colleges to get together and to learn various
things that are useful and fruitful in developing their personalities.
(d) To develop self-reliance and selfconﬁdence with courage and vigour.
Students from different colleges were
invited. R. Venkateswaran, S. Nageshwar and
T. S. Ananthu represented the I.I.T., Madras.
After aspeech by the Principal of Presi—
dency College, Dr. T. R. Govindachari, the
seminar was inaugurated by Dr. P.V. Cherian.
He gave an interesting speech which was
followed by another one from Miss Burns of
the U. S. Embassy. The delegates were
then divided into four groups. These groups
retired into different rooms, and then discus-

sed at length the different aspects of the
speeches delivered. This procedure was
followed in the evening as well as on the
subsequent days. Notable among those who
delivered lectures were Dr. C. P. Ramaswamy
Aiyar (Chairman of the National Integration
Committee). Mr. Appadurai, Miss Iravathi
(Principal of Queen Mary’s College) and Dr.
(Mrs) Ramaswamy. An excellent concluding
address was delivered by Mr. Chengalvarayan
on the evening of the let October. The Chairmen of the different groups then read out the
resolutions passed in each group. An interesting feature of the proceedings was the entertainment programme held every day at the
end of the day’s session.
The delegates from I.I.T., Madras created

a tremendous impression in the seminar. All
three of them took a very active part in the
proceedings. Two of them, T. S. Ananthu
and R. Venkateswaran, were Chairmen of
their respective groups. T. S. Ananthu won
theprize for leading the best group, His group,
which was adjudged the best, consisted of
people of various shades of opinion, and
therefore the discussion was of a very interestingnature. R. Venkateswaran entertained
the delegates with his songs, and was highly
appreciated. In his concluding speech, Dr.
T. R. Govindachari said that he was very
much impressed by the performance of the
students from I.I.T.
The seminar was organised under the
auspices of the Presidency College Union, and
the eﬂiciency and organizing capacity of the
Secretaries, Mr. M. Thiagarajan and Miss
Ruby Pramila Solomon was really commendable.

were held in which the chairman of the groups
read out their reports and a combined discussion ensued. At the end of the conference,
a ‘Students National Integration Brigade’ was

A pledge was taken by all present to promote
National Integration.

efforts of the Y.M.C.A. the Conference was a
grand success. It certainly led to Integration
