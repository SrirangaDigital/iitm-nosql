with Y our P ermission

I see the Deeds living,
And Heroes Dead,
Float past
In the raging storm.

May be God made it tall to distinguish it from
the trees, bushes and coffee plantations.

on its face in place of spots. We dunno what
it uses for brains. As for vocal cords and
eyebrows, they are made of India Rubber.

of soap, it has never had a taste.

TWO-wheeled vehicles it can handle with
ease
Hey I Lets ’ave your scooter please.
A scarf is a must when it goes to town
At home, a turban it wears for a crown.

It goes to ‘ pitchers ‘ once a week come hell
or high ﬁre, periodical or no moneyorder.
It takes to cards like a ﬁsh to water (Anthropologists have not been able to ﬁgure out this
one yet.)
We have reason to believe that it has an
aversion to maths lectures. Maybe its the
quiet in the room that affects its foliated
‘ pia—matter ’. Maybe it is the proximity of
the members of a foreign breed that affects its
primitive instinct of survival. (It is found to
sulk in the German class). Maybe it is offended by the sight of a four eyed.creature writing
hieroglyphs on the black-board or maybe it is
plumb homesick. For those who are slow on
the uptake : It is a very versatile creature and
on a tennis court changes rapidly—according
to Darwins theory, from a giraﬂc to a pregnant
hippo at least in gait if not in girth. It is learnt
from reliable sources that it is trying very
hard to get into the cricket eleven (P. I.)
Histrionic talents P
It personiﬁed Don Garcia in last years play.
It also talks the ‘ Appachals ' language
ﬂuently.

Other characteristics summarised :—
Pat it very dearly,
At you it’ll glare and frown ;
Thinks it looks S O
The poor old clown !. scarey,
Seen it puff a cigarette?
Even its ears give out Smoke.
It reminds me of my little pet
Trying to gulp some coke.
It is very sane in mind and is competent
enough to render valuable advice :—
To a cricketeer,

It pays to be tall so strive to this end
While bowling, act a ﬁery ﬁend.
‘ To bore the batsman’ should be your
aim
With a ball or your face—its all the

THE JOKE & THE IDIOT
Oftentimes a widely appreciated joke has a
tinge of vulgarity. This is nothing unnatural
for human nature is essentially coarse and
vulgar; sophistication comes out of its suppression; real reﬁnement, out of its complete
elimination. Since most of us are not saints
or sadhus we may enjoy this joke distinguishing the intelligent from the idiot.
An idiot is one who is foolish enough to
attempt to cross a channel whose average
depth is five feet; an intelligent man is one
Who dares to enroll himself in a sun-bathing
club in spite of the announced average age of
its women members as 45! The law of
averages is a double-edged weapon !

To see
The whole seathing mass
of humanity
drowned in the rain,
And to watch everyone
Progressing towards
The doom,

The extinction,
Inevitable,
And yet be unmoved.

POET SUBRAMANYA
Among the the foremost exemplars

of

I see all,
Extrinsically,
The Deeds living

Tamil literature, Bharathi’s name will remain

And the Heroes Dead,

alive for all ages. Subramanya Bharathi was
undoubtedly one of the greatest poets of all
times. His compositions have become so
popular; by direct of their simplicity, melody
high and noble philosophies and ideas made
simple and palatable even to the common
uneducated mass; that they are being given
to us in some form or other all the time. His
poems were simple but sparkled with brilliance
and equisite grace. He chose to explain his
ideas not by high-sounding words but with

Float Past
Like the ageless phantoms ;
And I am raised above self,
Which I know shall perish.

Common events

of life,

which we

are also

able to see but not able to appreciate
Bharathi’s uniqueness lies in the fact that he
was able to transform those common events
by his magic wand ‘ genius ’, into a digestable, good and tasty admixture.
Bharathi’s role in freedom struggle was
nothing small. He instilled courage and that
spirit of indepeiidance, in the people at the
right time. His genius wrote such revolutionery
poems with such vehement force, that it
made people iindaunted. Bharathi himself
was undaunted and had indomitable courage,
facing grim hardships of British Rule. What
Rousseau was to France, Bharathi was to
Tamilnad and India.
Bharathi died young. Simple and marvellous, marvellous but simple, noble and high,
and high but simple, his poems are things
of joy and peace for ever. He was an
institution.
An interesting interlude was offered the
other day in the form of Bharathi'Day Celebration. The highlight of the occasion was
a learned lecture by Sri. K. Chandrasekaran
M.A., B.L., a renowned scholar with Prof.
Krishnamurthy presiding and emphatically
saying that he had the privilege to have seen
Bharathi and known him, and to

But I know also,
That I am the Master,
of all I survey,
And all that I don’t,
For no destiny binds me
I ackowledge none,
Above me,
I am the Supreme,
For I am a ‘Man’.

was to admire him. The function also
bought forward some students with songs,
the highlight being good karnatic songs by K.
S. Krishnamurthy (III B. Tech.)
To conclude, ‘ Poet Bharathi has fulﬁlled
the time mission of a poet. He has created
beauty not only through the medium of
glowing and lovely words but has kindled the
souls of millions of men and women, to a
more passionate love of freedom and a richer
dedication to the service of the country.
Poets like Bharathi cannot be considered as
the treasure of any country. He is entitled
by his genius and work, to rank among those

who have transeended all limitations of race,

language and continent and have become the
universal possession of mankind' so says
Smt. Sarojini Naidu, and what a great
genius was this Bharathi, and long live his
glory.

Why this Day of Judgement,
O Gods on Mount Kailas ?
Have Pity,
On your creation,

Of which I am a part,
I pray.
Forgive, O Lord,

I am a sinner,
punish me,
but be lavish
in thy forgiveness.
Judge me,
but not too harshly,
For I am but,

‘An erring Man’.
