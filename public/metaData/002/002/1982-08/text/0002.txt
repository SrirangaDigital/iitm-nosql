J!:I)ITORIAL

It is now a

90(~

25 days since the first issue of CT made its appearance.

The cause for the delay goes back to a day in mid-1une (or was it May? )
when the Administration qot together and decided to devote three
whole weeks of the

semest~r

to evaluations.

Last week was one of

those.
The previous

issu~

of CT seems to have come under quite a hit

of criticism from one of our sister mags, and then there were writings
on hostel wallso We only hope that our critics will have cause enough
to eat their words on

~eading

this and the succeeding issues of CT.

In our previous editorial, we had,

if you will recall, put out

calls for any kind of articles. The response received has been good,
we are glad to say, and hope this will continue to the finish. We
specially

invit~

articles from the first-years--from whom our

pleas seem to have elicited no response whatsoever o
--Eds.
CAMPASTIMES WILDLIFE SPECIAL

k~cn

fauna of this campus, we are bringing out a special issue. Articles
