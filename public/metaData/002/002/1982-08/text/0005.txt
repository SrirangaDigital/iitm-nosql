PRE REGISTRATION

'Twas not in vain

Then, for a COT

Some Ad-Block brain

I

New heights did try to reach;

I rush to M.S.Bo

The Profs o were caught,

At last I

And then we got

The room in mind,

A Faculty Advisor, each

haven'

t

got,
find

But the Prof's gone for te8

So, midst my mugging

II

For exams so bugging.

Is the query I makeo

My problems to him I spill.

But soon, I feel so lost

He hasn't a clue

That all I wish to

About what to do-

(I bet you'd feel so, too J )

Just hands me

a form to fill.

What can I take ?

II

do

Is finish, whatever the cost.

The carbon slips

At last it was done

The paper rips:

And even tho' 'twasn't fun

It

I'm sorry, sir -it toreo"

Much cause had I for elation.

He pulls one more

Tho' exams were coming ,

Out

In joy, I was humming

f~om

his store,

I jump, pen falling to the floor.

'Cause I'd finished my pre-registration
THE REGISTERED ONE

LIMERICKA

I sat by the Duchess at tea,
As distressed as a person could be.
Her rumblings abdominal
Were simply phenomenal,
And everyone thought it was mel

A guy, Somnath by name,
To politics-reeking Narmada carne,
He became a Councillor,
And Publicity Coordinat~rf
In pursuit of fame, fame and fame.
