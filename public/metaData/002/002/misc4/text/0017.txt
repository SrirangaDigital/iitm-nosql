@ltT man blues
Wizened senior, stubble and all
in .his lair, snoring loud
he wakes at night, looks around
takes himself to Tarams stall.

Pensively he lights a smoke
finds a man to sponsor tea
his belly growls, it's now a croak
how to get a meal for free ?

Barely a shadow, dull moonlight
the hour late, past midnight.
Lazily he rubs his pate,
thanking Nair for a bun omelette.

Night melts away into dawn
senior retires in the emerging morn
slowly finds his way to bed
and crashes with the Greatful Dead.

Fresher raw, watch out for him
be sure to satisfy his every whim
observe and you're sure to see
what you will in four years be.
