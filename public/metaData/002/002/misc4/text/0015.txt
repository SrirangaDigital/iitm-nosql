,One day while going up the stairs
I

met a man who wasn't there

He wasn't there again today
I wish to hell he'd go away.

He told me 'bout a far-off land
where people cried when they were glad
Standing on their heads all night
Shouting "Right is wrong and wrong is right."

For health, they said, drink gallons of fenny
For wealth, no probs, just sell your granny
For mirth, say cheese and drown your cat
While beating yourself with a cricket bat.

Love, of course, had a market price
determined by the supply and demand of lice
Hate had no marginal utility
You could get any amount for free

Cabbages and kings were the costliest things
dearer than water by nine shillings
You could coolly get a professor free
