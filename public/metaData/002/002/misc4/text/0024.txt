How I got hsrs
Once in a town where houses touched the 'sky
There lived a king who had three wives
Fairest of fair were these three queens,
Beauty like theirs had never been

seen~

Their lips were coloured in Cupid's blood
Their cheeks were as flush as 'the sun at dawn
Their hair flowed like cascades of dew
Their movements were suppler than a fleeting fawn's

The King, with them, day and night remained,
their every wish and whim entertained,
until Providence, cruel, crimson and mean
in his heavenly abode turned green.

Soon the town was under attack,
It had no real army that could fight back
And so the king for his dereliction paid,
struck by a spear, he fell down flat

Up there in heaven he was greeted with a frown,
"For your misdeeds you deserve a dressing-down !
You are cursed to be, in your next life, an Indian,
and that too ( what can be worse! ) an lIT'ian."
