Dear IITians,
Another year, another sem, another issue,

& before you could say," CT we miss you ",
Here we are trying something new

& hoping our efforts haven't gone askew.

About the cover, you must be curiousIt IS by Mario Miranda & not spurious.
And there is LSG's IIT(M) Hostelite's Moan,
which unless sung by him is quite a drone.

For getting us out of a lot of hanky-panky,
One guy we have to thank is good 01' Venky.
Then there are others infinite
Who along with us spent sleepless nights.

As looking for articles we went along,
All we garnered were stanzas and songs.
Thus we the Editors of Campastimes
Found that lIT junta speak in rhymes.

For those who find this issue a crime,
We'll be back with the usual slime, next time.
