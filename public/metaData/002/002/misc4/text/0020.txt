Excited housewives discussed it
The mystery defied solution:
A learned scholar dismissed it
As an optical illusion.
A mathematics Don at Oxford
said: "Taking recourse to LogicJ
The answer is straight-forward
it is simply Black Magic."
The President addressed the nation:
"~here

is no cause for terror:

Just use your imagination
it's just like looking in a mirror."
Nobel.

Laurea~es,

when sounded

Did complex calculationsVarious theories were propounded
After hurried consultations.
Supercomputers were fed
the problem of finding the causes
No answer came; instead
the machines blew their fuses.
Soon enough the Physicists claimed
To have come to a conclusion
The spin of the Earth was to be blamed
For causing the confusion.
