TAT...

What did I see ?
Oh! I didn't believe it.
For, I think it was a she
That too, here in I.I.T.

I saw her near the G.C.

When I went to the Library
First I thought she was in E.C.
But it was just the contrary.

She was not just another girl
You see, she had good looks
The hair she had were in a lovely curl
But then she carried a handful of books!

Her graceful face was simply divine
Her skin soft, fair and tender
Why it'd have made even Marylin pine
But she walked humbly, this feminine gender.

The dress she wore was exquisite

The silky shirt and the dainty skirt
She had everything in proportions requisite
This made me, with her, flirt
