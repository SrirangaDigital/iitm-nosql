Out

thl's

It was a hot afternoon
and, he couldn't finish grub soon
searched for socks that would'nt stink
(Oh ! no ! his grub wouldn't sink)
for he found he'd washed none
and the time already past one
He patted his mud dorn bike
until the dead tyred gave him a dose of psyche
Like a dog

bar~ing

at the sun,

he cursed his mach 1 and began to run
Entered he flushed with sweat at frets
The prof fired him for his guts
Exhausted, he settled in a corner
He couldn't stand Cauchy any longer
Reimann, Maxwell, too must have stirred in their graves
as he cursed them in \q' number of ways
The trees outside stirred up a soothing zephyr
dried his wet workshop attire
Through the window he could see
sparrows and monkeys play with glee
and down below, the deer on a grazing spree
All the world seemed flirting free
His head drooped down to his hand
