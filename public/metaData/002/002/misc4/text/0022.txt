to my
You've muffled my laughsand smiled my smiles,
you've wiped my tears,
and dreamt dreamy miles,
you've borne my pounding fists
and my wandering thoughts on you,

you know of all my griefs
and all my

happin~ss

too,

people say you're old that I must let you go,
but you're a part of my life
and that they'll never know So here's to you my pillow
my pal and pet of years,
I'll cherish you for ever 'cause you're my smiles and tears.
