There he lies so innocent and pale
like a rosebud soft and left to fade
So at home in a bewer of leaf
with petals bedewed with drops of grief
He made sense in a meaningless world
as a solitary tree in a barren desert
The mind is, too fraught with pain to ask
where justice and faith have sudden flawn
and why this terrible hand has come
to do such a dreadful, dreadful wrong
Like a snowflake so white and pure
That muse melt for it cannot endure
the scorching sun who is no kith
nor the friendless ground beneath
His eyes aflutter send pangs of hope,
He hasn't gone yet, he's here still
still within touch, still within call
still within knowing I'm there at all
A little more time is all we ask

Is it perchance too much to want
