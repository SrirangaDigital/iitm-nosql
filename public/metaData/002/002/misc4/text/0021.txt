Quantum Mechanical interaction
was at the root ( they stated
Relativity, Universal Expansion
{ It was just too complicated
Parliament set the matter to rest
with cunning, foresight, tact
They interchanged the meanings of 'East' and 'West',
By passing a momentuous Act.
"How does it matter which is which 7"
They said with flawless reason.
"Life will go on without a hitchIt

"In the East the sun must rise.
All else matters least.
If it is elsewhere in the skies
why, then, that direction is East."
In his grave Rudyard Kipling's rest
must have been disturbed, I'll bet.
For West was East & East was West
That day the twain had met.
A terrible voice spoke from overhead
Followed by monstrous peals of mirth
"I AM GOD.", the great voice said
"APRIL FOOL, CITIZENS OF EARTH !"
