&Monkey

Two wise monkeys sat on a tree
talking about things as they seem to be
One made sure they were alone
and whispered in a hushed tone.
"There's a rurnour 'round that can't be true
That man descended from me and you."
A sneer erupted on the monkey's face
Exclaiming "It's a darn disgrace.

A monkey never'took a life,
starved a'child or left his wife.
He wouldn't use a club or gun
to break someone's head and run
And here's one thing that you'd never see
A monkey making a fence around a coconut tree
and let coconuts all go waste
forbidding others even a taste.
Maybe man descended, it ain't no fuss
but brother, he ain't never descended from us.
