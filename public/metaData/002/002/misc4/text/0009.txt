As I lay awake that night (for the dead cannot sleep)
Thinking of life and death and such matters deep
I thought, maybe, the others are dead too;
maybe we all die as we grow
Maybe, dear, between you and I, the only
difference is that I know.

Life 'is a beautiful giftwith goings dark or bright,
One learns to get, one learns to give,
and one learns to live alright,
Life is'a beautiful poemwith notes low or shrill,
One gets to hum, one tries to sing,
But one learns to live the thrill,
Life is a beating heartwith rhythms matching emotion,
one learns to live, one learns to die,
and one knows it's not a notion.
-Alka Arora
