But who gives a hoot for cellular division

Lord, is there anything I can't flub
will I
I

ever be in an intellect club

have never found the key to knowledge

And my folks want me to go to college

Oh such a thing I

constantly dread

I'd as soon join the navy instead
Lord please give me a sign
That you have been listening all this time

If you will help I'll give you my all
And won't even chew gum in study hall
Please lead me out of this constant coma
And give me a chance at my diploma

Let others fight about church and state
I

pray only to graduate
