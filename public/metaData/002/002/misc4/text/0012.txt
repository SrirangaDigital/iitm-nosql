Neither beauty nor brains to us they concede,
In doing so, their egos they feed,
Assisted by soothsayers and laity,
That 'girls will never make it to lIT.'

Is this 'Intro' then a kind of test,
At which they appear to be at their best,
'Is she steadfast or fickle,
Or will she dissolve into a trickle.'

But we are made of sterner stuff,
We'll make it to the top however tough,
It is the view of the French P.M. Edith Gesson,
Men are replacable in every field except one.

Recognition has always reached us late,
Look at the vote - it was one long wait
'coz

from the. dawn of civilization,
from the days of Greece,

They have been such MCP's !
