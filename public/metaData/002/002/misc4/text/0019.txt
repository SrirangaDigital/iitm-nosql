(With Apologies to Anthony Burgess)

That day the sun rose in the west.
It was a bright morning in May.
While some thought it was all for the best
Others said it was Judgement Day.
"COMMUNIST PLOT" cried the Washington Post
"u.S. DEMANDS APOLOGY"
"I knew it' would happen", was someone's boast
"From my knowledge of astrology."
The sole survivor of an endangered species
of maroon tailed Moroccan hawks
Took one look and died of heart disease
After litting out two horrified squawks.
The Land of the Rising Sun, Japan
Felt wretched and mistreated;
The Emperor announced a severe ban
On the Sun-for having cheated.
No one felt as angry, yet,
A$ Physics Profs. in school'I'he- phenomenon had upset
Th~

Fleming's Left Hand Rule.
