She didn't respond, this charming young lass
So I did everything: Jump, dance and even scream
But she kept walking away, straight to her class
This jolted me and I woke up to realise it was
all a dream !

...TIT

Like the Assyrians, they descended on the fold,
A frightening sight to behold,
In faded jeans and sloppy shirts,
Swarmed a 'Hajaar' youth in diabolic mirth.

The questions were fired in quick succession,
Each exhibiting his supreme condescension,
'After four years, your plans?',they mocked,
'A fifth year at EC ?',they scoffed.

A hackneyed joke doing its rounds,
At lIT and its envIrons,
of 'Batman, Superman, the beauty and the beast,
The first three don't exist - to say the least.'
