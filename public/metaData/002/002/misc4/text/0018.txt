Alone at dawn,
Drinking in cool darkness
Anticipating ...
the first rays of light,
Yearning to be one with Nature.
Turmoil in the heart ...
The mind wanders, ever restlessSearching for a purpose in life
Love is yet to be. known.
At once- a growing need for companionship
Desperate to be quenched
Coursed like devils in the blood
to die down gradually .••
An unsteady calm prevails
'God' is within the soul,
which cries for release, freedom and peace.
Alone at dusk
left wanting and hoping for
A True friend.
