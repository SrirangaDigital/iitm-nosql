up thLS
Woke up this morning and found I was dead
Too lazy to get up, I stayed in bed
Wife pulled me out, showered me with abuse
'You've got work to do, Death's no excuse'.

Drove madly to the office, tao dead to care
Walked through the door and flopped into my chair
collegues treated me just as on other days
To them, Io guess, I was dead always

Came home from office, asked my wife if she loved me
She said, 'Dear, with NesQafe, you get a spoon free'.
Had dinner

a~d

went out to watch a play

The actors looked animated but had nothing to say.

Driving home, I noticed, there were stars in the sky
I felt I could reach them if I'd only try
The moon behind the clouds seemed to say
If you know you're dead, you may find a way
