Oh LOl'd,
o

Ms '1â€¢

lord hear my anxious plea

Algebra is killing me
I know not of X or Y
And probably won't until the day I die

Please Lord help me at this hour
As I take my case to the highest power
I care not for fame or loot
Just help me find a square root

In English I studied hard
And read all the words of the bard
But my mind is like a hateful Judas
I couldn't recall 'Et tu Brutus'

Lord, must I offer an apology
For three times failing in Biology
Why is it I'm in such a fog?
concerning the innards of a frog

I push and strive and strain and grope
To come to terms with the microscope
Lord, please forgive my derision
