Situation 3
There is only 1 copy of the most-needed book in POE or some equivalently shady course
that requires major fundaes. You accidentally come across in a stack where somebody else has
obviously hidden it. Tomorrow's quiz will probably contain all the questions lifted from it you ...
(a)

Make a conscientious effort to locate the person who hid it and tell him that he'd done
the wrong thing. You give the book to him forewarning him from repeating the
misdemeanor.

(b)

Hide it in another place so that he will waste time searching for the book. You take a
Xerox copy of the book.

(c)

You take the book for yourself and after locating the person who hid the book, go
complain to the librarian that this fellow bearing such and such roll number in involved
in unethical practices.

KEY
Question No.
