EDITORIAL
Welcome! The editorial policy of this Campus magazine (or house organ if you want it) as much
back into time as the archives reflect, has been an attempt to thin-film the minimum of thought
into maximum of region. Like the true sons of tradition we are (our regular issues etc.) we vote
to toe the hallowed precedent.
This issue on a browse you'll agree, is quite eclectic drawing contents ranging from the serious
to the inane (the serious is inane and the inane serious). We would like to thank all our
contributors some of whom have contributed to this issue directly and others whose entries into
various creative writing competitions, we've culled in debonair spirit. A few have exercised
their right to anonymity which one would guess is being clever, just in case you wish to exercise
your right to retribution.
Now we've got some great news to offer you, which is our decision to tenninate this tedium.
Well .. editors can lie. On second thoughts we feel it would be quite unbecoming of sons of
tradition to fail to deliver the usual lament concerning the moribund status of contributions. So
here goes ...
Now that the potion is ready
We relax and watch, the early
Summer showers patter softly,
The tamarind tree shake slightly
Against the late evening glow
And mull upon those moments low
When the editorial shears, produce
Deficient, lay rusted in disuse
And we sat and sighed and gave thought:
Have just the impending ills wrought
II

This frugal muse on the sure-footed?"
Such cogitations stay unrequited
While you with the mag get acquainted.
