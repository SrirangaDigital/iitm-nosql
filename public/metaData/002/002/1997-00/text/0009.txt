THE DAYS OF TIME ARE NUMBERED

Professor Neverontime jumped with joy and tried to somersault around the room. "Too late!"
he realized, while groaning in the rubble of his laboratory that (1) His lab was small, (2) He was
60 years old, (3)He was fat and never could somersault. "Next time", he thought, "I will
celebrate the successful completion of an experiment with caviar, or by waving a flag".
The cause of his elation was, in his words, "A sleek, state of the art, beautiful" God knows
What. In reality it looked like a beetle which had been run over by an 18 wheel truck. What was
this gizmo? Good question. It was a time machine. Noo! I hear your say. That's not possible
I hear you say. What happens if you meet yourself? I hear you ask. Well, lets see what Prof.
Neverontime has to say about it.
"Well you see nature would never let such paradoxes to occur, because if you went back in time
and met yourself, your old self would be so disgusted by your new self that the old self would
make sure that it developed into a new self that was nothing like the new self that the old self
had met. The same goes for the future. Got it? No, well neither did I for that matter, but never
mind, time travel is possible. Okay see ya! Got to go to the future to see how the past
develops."
Ten seconds later Prof Neverontime runs into the government building and finds a thing called
a bureaucrat. The following is the conversation between them:

Prof: Oh My God ! Listen ! I have important news for y'ou.
Buro: Oh! Has the P.M's new coffee blender arrived? Good! Good! He's been pestering me
about it for the past one week.

Prof: No! No ! Its a major disaster!
Buro: No! Please! Please don't tell me you broke it.
Prof [Intense Frustration] will you listen to me ! The days of Time are numbered.
Buro: [Indignation] I am listening to you. Anyway I already know that.
