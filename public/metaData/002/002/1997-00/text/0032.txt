EXILE
"Will the prisoner please rise!". The bailiffs voice resonated across the packed
courtroom as all eyes turned, fIrst to the prisoner, standing still defiant and unrepentant and then
to the judge; who was to pronounce his fate.
It was happening! The climax: of the most spectacular trial of the millenium, the situation
of the most hotly debated arguments in living memory; This was the fmal moment of truth, the
hour of judgement. Shall we reckon?

The judge paused, waited for the hubub to die down, summed up the moment and
commenced on his pronouncement:
"The prisoner, Gesswiss the son of Ghoth, has been acused of wilfully fomenting unrest
and disturbance wherever he goes. He has publicly renounced the code of our Galactic
Federation; he has called for the formation of a new order adopting his own ethics and ideals;
he has resisted and often contravened the regulations which make our society stable. In short,
he is a reactionary of the most sinister kind.
On all these accounts, we find him guilty as charged, and deserving of our utmost
contempt and opprobium. The penalty for these crimes is death. "
"And yet-".
"And yet?" Had the judge decided to be merciful? Will he be offering a second chance?
A maelstorm of conflicting thoughts deluged the minds of the audience.
"And yet, we must also remember that the prisoner's actions were derived from purely
altruistic motives; that he sincerely believed in the substance of his preachings; that in all his
deeds he never once counselled violence or hatred. He was misguided, but he meant well, and
that counts to his favour"
"Hence I'm commuting the death sentence to one of permanent exile. Gesswiss, son of
Ghoth, shall be left stranded with no accoutrement, on the outskirts of the galaxy. He shall be
surrounded in that world by a group of technologically primitive savages. But he shall live" .
