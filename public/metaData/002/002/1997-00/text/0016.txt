Stupendous! Give 15 more marks to

A TRAIN JOURNEY
The iron horse gallops on rusty loops,
Shrieks whistles, shifts sparrows off rugged roofs.
Flurried stillness breeds beyond the window,
Inside, amidst voices, roosts solitude.
The iron horse pauses at the station; offers
Visions: Multitudinous sea, walking past.
You sit and stare, grasp just uniforms
The eyes expectant are hurt into a daze.
The iron horse jerks forward; mechanically.
The introspective moment, past brightness
Splutters, falls, heralds a new cycle.
Life a train journey, soul a journey car.
