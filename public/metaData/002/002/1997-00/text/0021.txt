MARRIAGE

The purohit's vedic incantations
Reverberate like the chimes of a big brass bell
In an empty hall.

The tongues of the sacrificial fire
Fed by the ghee of faithless rituals
Lick up the sanctity of matrimony.

She holds the stranger's hand and comes round
The sacrificial fire leaping up
Like a question mark at the portals of future.

He feels the familiar stirring
The touch of female flesh
The circle is complete.

Below lie scattered
The ashes of a sacrament
Distorted and destroyed.
