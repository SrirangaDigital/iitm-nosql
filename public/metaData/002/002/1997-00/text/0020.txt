A BIRTHDAY POEM

Flare charming beast
On your 25th year.
Flare whom I yearn
In blinded love to touch
Stamp my closed eyes
Let adhere
Sweat of an upper lip
Into the crook of your neck
Far. Pliant. resilient
And breath in the fumes of love.

Flare till hair fluffy yours
Crackles, bristles, sparkles
Shears across dry air
And eyes yours smoulder
Mock in derisive stare
Men dipped and world low.
Flare lion heart
Whose strength I quote
In constant thought
Whose apparition with

A singing heart
Daily in my mind I crush.
Flare in burnished glow
For my love and my faith.
