Prof: [Confused] How? I patented my Time MachineD! before leaving. How do you know?
Buro: Hey man! Are you loco or what? Everybody who's anybody knows that the days of
time are numbered. Look at the calendar, today is 28.1.96.

Prof: AAuugh! I didn't mean they were numbered, I mean that we can count our days left on
the earth.

Buro: You need some serious help! Of course we can count our days. They are numbered with
the help of calendars.

Prof [breaking down, almost crying] Please ! Please ! Try to understand my problem ...
Buro: What can I do if you have an illogical hatred of dates and calendars? What did you say
your name was again?

Prof: Professor Neverontime.
Buro: Well that explains it. Look, If you want I know a very good shrink whose fee are quite
low.

Prof

[Crying] I'm not Crazy! I, I just wanted to warn you that the the da, da, days of time
are numbered.

Buro: I know that Hey! Hey! Where are you running off like a mad man?
Epilogue
The Professor was sent to the mental asylum after he was seen attacking and destroying a
curious thing that looked like a beetle which had been run over by an 18 wheel truck.
