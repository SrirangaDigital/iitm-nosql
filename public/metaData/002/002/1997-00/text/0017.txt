POEM
Lewis Caroll says 'Rhyme or reason'
I say 'neither Rhyme nor reason'
My friend from ear to ear grins
And says '1 will tell
the golden rules
of writing
poetry. '
He sayeth 'Rearrange words in a line
so that they make sense not
pay no attention to rhyme.
get a computer to adjust
the meter for you.
Assume not, that your poem is read.
Search for inner meaning so generations
to come can scratch their heads wondering
why you wrote what you wrote .
You must write about cabbages and kings
Of Saarang and the environment,
And of everything Indian.
Confuse the reader with words as
Supercalijragulisticexpralidocious.
Last, remember,
Poetry is punctuated prose.
This is my poem, I say
I am like this only.
G. Sriram

Every streetlamp I pass
Beats like a fatalistic drum
And through the spaces of the dark
Midnight shakes the memory
As a madman shakes a dead geranium.
- T.S.Eliot (Rhapsody on a Windy Night)
