Pandemonium broke loose on the courtroom as armed guards whisked the prisoner away
to the detention center. The news spread rapidly -" Geswiss is guilty, but he's going scot free" .
Riot police formed blockades as security around his person was stepped up.
Amidst all this chaos, Gesswiss himself remained strangely calm. He proferred no
conversation with the Enforcement officer while the latter prattled on aout his forthcoming
punishment.
"We'll ship you out on an autocruiser and then blow her up in orbit. Mighty, pretty sight
it'll make; like a new star in the heavens. We'll hypnoteach you all the relevant background;
history, geography and so on. We'll even give you a profession, make you a woodworker's son,
I think. Should be an experience; What do you think?".
"I think ... ' (His reply, as usual, was slow and considered), ... that these people will
have all the more need for my teachings. "
The E. O. laughed, then caught himself and shrugged his shoulders. All the best then.
You'll need all the luck you can get with the Jews".
