Soapy now had reached a quiet comer
Where stood a gabled, quaint and rambling church.
A soft light glowed from window violet-stained.
Above, the moon serene and lustrous shone;
Sleepy sparrows twittered in the caves.
The organist loitered over the keys to make
Sure of the coming Sabbath anthem. This
Sweet music drifted into the troubled soul
Soapy stood cemented on to the fence,
By that Anthem; he had known it well
When he had thoughts of roses, mothers, friends,
And ambitions. He viewed, with horror swift,
The abyss he had tumbled headlong in,
The days degraded, motives base and hopes
That long were dead and wrecked faCUlties.
Yet in a moment did his heart respond;
The conjunction of Soapy's state of mind
And influences Of the old church wrought.
He was thrilled to the novel mood, and moved
By an impulse strong, to fight his fate
Out of the mire he would pull himself
To make a man of himself once again.
And conquer evil which had hold of him.
He was young; and there was time to start
And find some work, a place; the morning next:
- A man had offered him a driver's place And be some body in this world; and be Soapy felt a hand laid on his ann.
Quick he wheeled and into a policeman's
Broad face he did look, who asked him stern
"What are you'doing here?" "Nothing, " replied
Soapy, "Come along, then" said that cop.
It was morning; the place the police court
The Magistrate pronounced the sentence, just,Â·
"Three months on the island", Blackwells guest.!
