Would ever a window- smasher wait and smile
For parley with minions of law? He left.
Soapy, twice unsuccessful, now walked
Into a modest cafe, ate his Jill.
"Now, call a cop; a coin haven't I, "
He told the waiter, "No cop for you"
He said, and called. The next was - Soapy felt
Himself, rising joint by joint
From that callous pavement. Waiters two
Had pitched him neatly, on his ears. He beat
The dust from clothes. Was arrest a rosy dream?
He travelled far before his courage gave
Leave again to capture, woo. A Cinch!
A modest girl of pleasing guise he saw
Gazing at a show-window; across,
A large policeman, severe, leaned against
A water plug. Now he did play the role
Of an execrated 'masher '; set his hat
At killing cant and sidled t 'ward the belle,
Made eyes at her and coughed and smiled and smirked.
Glad was he, the cop was watching him.
She moved away a little, stood and gazed.
Soapy could be on his way to the isle!
Right little, tight little isle!
She faced him, stretched a hand and caught his -sleeve;
"Sure Mike. Blow me to a pail of suds"
She played the clinging iry to Soapy's oak.
The cop they passed and gloomy Soapy grew.
Was he doomed to freedom? Cursed spite!
He shook her off at the fanher corner, ran
Till he reached a play house, saw a cop
Lounging grand. And Soapy caught the straw.
He danced and raved, and drunken gibberish yelled
But the cop had turned his back on Soapy, twirled
His club, and told a friend "'Tis one of them
Hartford college Yale boys celebrating;
We have to leave them. Harmless, noisy though. "
Soapy ceased this unavailing racket.
He muttered against the men with helmets, clubs.
Simply, would he into their clutches fall,
He seemed to them a king who could not wrong.
