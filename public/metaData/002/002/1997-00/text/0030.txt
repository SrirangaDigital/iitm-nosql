CHILDHOOD
Two thousand kicks.
Peppery licks
At the scales
Of a hundred smooth wounds.
Worms teasing out
Of cracks in an
Ancient
Wall.
Poignancy rumbling
Like shadows of an uncertain
Monument of steel.
Many long innings
We never played
Sparrows.
Hushed voices.
Bright
As the vision of a shared dream.
Those
Were the days.

To lose one parent, Mr. Worthing, may be regarded
as misfortune; to lose both looks like carelessness.

- Oscar Wilde (The importance of being earnest)
