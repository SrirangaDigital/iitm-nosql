DOUGH STORY
The old man bakes bread
With smile, clear shining eyes,
Weaving the dough, mixing
Yeast and brilliant philosophy.
"What's your secret" I ask
IIO! love and labour" he sighs
IIPutting one's heart and soul,
in their silent occupation"
Many wise words were said by him,
Which I needn't repeat,
Excepting
"There are already enough books"
After I mentioned he should write one.
