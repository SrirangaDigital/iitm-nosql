SPARK - WEDNESDAY
(Sorry, Mr.Eliot)

Because I do hope to turn again
Because I do hope
Because I do hope to turn
Desiring the mind's gift and spirif s scope
I shall again strive to strive towards such things
(Why should the young lark droop its wings early?)
Why should I adopt
The barren calm of usual life?
Because I do hope to know again
The suffused glow of the positive hour
Because I do think
Because I know I shall know again
The transitory but lifting power
Because I can again drink
There, where trees flower, and springs flow, for there is
Something always.
Because I know that time is always time
And place is always place
And what is actual is actual for one time
And only for one place
I rejoice the goals and
I rejoice the blessed face
And rejoice the voice
Because I do hope to turn again
Consequently I rejoice, having to construct something
Upon which to rejoice
And pray to God to have mercy upon us
And I pray that I may continue
These matters that with myself I too much discuss
