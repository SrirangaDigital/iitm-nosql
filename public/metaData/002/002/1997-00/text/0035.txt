WHEN IT WAS MG LAST
Your babe Jessia on the ramp
Her face scarred in silver bands
Tore across the white fumes;
In her stride, shook death.
Death fell on the crowd in the well Faces stoned to flashing lights
Bouncing off her somatic shapes
Were caught with eyes glazed.
The show ends, she sips cognac on rocks,
Death stalks me, who rides the bikeSerpants arrest waist; wind buffets face
Back safe by twelve to the campfire.
The fire crackles, the maidens cackle.
Jessia joins the geeze, gyrates round.
My fractured leg shrieks, I retire ...
After lIT, it'll be the monastery.

TO FLY
To rise gently into freedom
Cool air fanning my wing
To glide in the ethereal night;
Survey all , Find myself king.
To dive, to swoop, to plummet, to plunge
To soar through darkness and light
To fly against the great firmanent
And shatter it with mymight!
One second or eternity,
An inch or the endless sea
In the boundless joy of speed and flight
Time and space are nothing to me.
To pierce through the thickest mist
With a single slash of a white wing
Unfettered, free, joyous
To spin, to twirl, to sing!
Oh, tofly ....
Lavanya Vasudevan
Sarayu.
