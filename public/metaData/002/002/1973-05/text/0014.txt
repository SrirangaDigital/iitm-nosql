DR. VIRK
Dr Preetmder Smgh VlTk, Professor of
ChemIcal Engmeenng, IS at the moment, the
most prlZed exhibIt In IlT's acadenuc wtld-hfe.
Brought from~hls natural habItat, the mtellectual Jungles of MIT, thIS umque creature has
already sttrred up a sensatiOn m the Chem
Department Rumour has It, that under
Prof Vtrk, the 4/5 Chem Students are for the
first tIme, beglll1lmg to have an mklmg of what
ChemIcal Engg IS all about.
Unfortunately, I could not establtsh much
rapport m my first encounter With thiS gentleman ThiS happened one mornmg when I
was standmg outside MSB 235, alrmg my
profound vIews on the problems whIch beset
our world, qUite oblIviOUS to the fact that
Prof Vlrk was slffiultaneously dlscussmg a
more mundane tOpIC like ' Mass-Transfer'
mslde MSB 235 Our dISCUSSIOn, m the
Immediate neighbourhood of hiS classroom,
dIdn't qUite appeal to the professor's sense
of httmour So, he bounced out of hiS classroom and dtrected towards us a roar which
The roar was so
said • Shut up I WIll you"
roarlIke that only a steam-roller or a rooster
could have emulated ItS mtenslty Everyone
who heard htm was VISibly Impressed Here
was a man who could not be trilled WIth.
As tht- weeks went by, Dr Vlrk bUilt an
aura of mystery around hunself by consistently
tummg down all mVltahons to act as a Judge
for anyone of the lIterary events, conductLd In
our mstItute Consequently, all of us were
highly ~pprehens1Ve when Ananth deCided to
ask the gentleman, for an mtervlew for
Campastl7nes Dr Vlrk, upset our predIctIOns
by grantmg Campastlmes the mt<-rvlew
Around 2 o'clock on a very sultry afternoon,
Nltm, Kns1ma, Ananth and myself trudged
along to MSB to beard the hon m hiS den.
The mtervlew that followed was both absorbmg and amusmg. Dr Vlrk turned out to be
a qUick-witted and an extremely articulate
conversationalIst
SpIced With a bit of

Amencan siang, Dr Vlrk ltpeaks EnglIsh with
a degree of sophistication th'lt I~ .tltogether
dehghtful to h~tLn to
In the par.lgr-.lph~ bdow, rav.: tn<-d to
faithfully rl!produce the anltwers to our questions, m thl! exact words ot Prof Vtrk QUite
a few of the answers, howev~r, are adulterated
With my own word~, but the general content
has not been changed
QuestlOll. We've heard a lot about your
academiC achtevements. Could you tell
us about them? '
Prof. Vlrk
(I graduated m Chern --Eng g.
from lIT KGP and stood second m my
class The chap who stood first was a
shade better than me Then, I went on
to do my Ph D at MIT and did a few
years of teaching there'
Q: • What IS the mlJor dtfference between
Engg Education In India and abroad,
particularly at MIT? '
A: (Well,at MIT, there are more courses to
pick from The education IS more
broad-based and hberalIsed The educatIOnal atmosphere there fosters mental
growth Out here, the system merely
tests your abulty to cross hurdles Here,
there are too many contact hours I
suppose the phIlosophy behind such a
system IS that the student should be kept
occupied all the time, or else he'll waste
hIS time ThIS IS a clencal approach
towards hfe After all, sometime or
another the student WIll be on hIS own
and wIiI have to deCide thmgs for hImself,
so It \vould certamly be more reasonable
to grant hIm more Independence at the
College level Itself '
Q: • Would It be pOSSible to adopt theIr
system of educatton m our set-up? '
A. 'Not entirely. For one thmg, you would
need many more lecturers to conduct all
the courses that are offered m Engg.
Colleges abroad I 40n't suppose there
are enough lectmers m lIT to enable
students here, to choose and study from a
WIde range of courses'
Q • SIr, do you
, L.~a'~\fk~tu~ejuJrn~g~~ed as;¥£it.'
'DOCTOR VIRK I •
g: . Okay, Dr Vuk, do you have as mueh of
cheatmg m exammatlons abroad as you
have m IndIa? '
A~ • No At MIT, there were such thmgs
as take-home exams and nobody ever
cheated even III these.
When I first came to IIT Madras, I
was told that cheatmg In exams 'IS a
major problem the teachers have to face:
I didn't belIeve thIS until I found It out
for myself There were many blatant
cases of cheatIng m the first few tutonal
assignments I h'ld given"
Well, I am not a d"tectlvc I cannot
go about trymg to find out who has
cheated from whom
No, cheatmg on -thIS scale was unheard
of even when, I was at IIT KGP •
Q: 'Why d9 you suppose cheatmg IS not so
prevalent among Amencan students ~ ,
A' 'The students there are more motivated.
Many of them have to work and pay for
their education, and so they are very
serious about It Here, It IS different
You see, when you are at lIT, your
mam aim IS to beat the system You
resort to variOUS subterfuges to get away
WIth the maximum marks pOSSIble It's
only when you are about 21, that IS, when
you have gone over the hili, that you begIn
to realize that cducatlOn IS somethmg With
whIch you can go ahead, somethmg you
can depend on.
We Wc.rLn't particularly con~Ctou~ of
thIS m Ollr und<-rgraduat<. years 'It KGP ,
Q: . Dr Vlrk, the average IndIan student,
say the one at IlT Madras, IS much more
pressunsed than hiS Amencan counterpart, by vIrtue of the fact that he has many
1llor<- contact hours Morc.over, unltke
the Amencan student, there IS little at
nothmg he can do about IndIfferent or
lousy teachmg He Ju<;t has to put up
With It Under such CIrcumstances,
wouldn't It be natural to expect the IndIan
student to be less motivated and somewhat
dIshonest 11) hiS work?'
A' • Look, a student can give a hundred
reasons for not havmg enough ImtlatIve.

[Summer 1973
But, m En);llleermg we are not concerned
WIth L"CU~tS \Ve are merely mterested
In dOing things
It IS upto the student to
tXU.l(.t the maximum from the teacher.
He,.must find enough motIvatIon to leam.
Nobody can do that for hlffi '
Q. 'What do you thmk of the Chern. Engg.
cour~es here ? '
A· (Now, what ktnd of a loaded questton 18
that? •
From what I've seen, I feel the Engg.
Courses here are filled With hard facts.
You are expected to learn these facts and
use them later for solVIng problems as a
profeSSIOnal engtneer.
ThiS IS the old, claSSIcal defimtlon of
engIneerIng, where the student IS taught
to be a good data book. You canrwt
operate that way
Your
mnovatlve
capacity Will be zero, because you are
totally exhaustmg an old storehouse of
knowledge, knowledge, that could become
obsolete at a future date.'

Q:

I What are your suggestIOns for improvIng the courses here? '
A: The syllabus should be problem-orIented.
Students should be made to solve
problems that do not have readymade
solutIOns, like problems currently facmg
the mdustry A problem-solvIng format
IS much more demandIng and It brmgs
out the inItIatIve In the student.'
Q • Do you beheve that a teacher should
also do research work? '
A: I Most certamly. I don't behevethat you
can be a good teacher WIthout bemg a
good research worker. The key element
of a good teacher IS to transmit creatIve
thtnkmg ThIS cannot be done unless
the teacher hImself IS Involved In thIS sort
of creative work
Some of the best teachers at MIT were
not good In the conventional sense, that
IS, they were not very aruculate. But
they could certamly convey the splnt of
creau, e thmkmg ,
