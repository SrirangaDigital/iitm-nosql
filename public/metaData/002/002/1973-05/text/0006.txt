(Summer 1973

CaOlpastiltles Editorial (1966-1972)
A CRITICAL REVIEW
(from a term paper in Organisation Behaviour)
An analYSIs of the edltonals through the
years 1966-72 reveals that but for the editorials
of 1971-72 which In content are a remarkable
departure from the estabbshed practice, all
others are totally related to ClllllpUS events.
One nught argue that thiS IS what a campus
newspaper IS for but there are more unportant Issues afFectmg us than the height of the
speed traps or the lack of water m the pool.
ThIs IS agam remforcmg the suggestIOn (to be
exammed later) that IITlans have httle or no
thought for anythmg outSide their httle world
of SIX hllDdred odd acres. Whether tms trend
IS deSirable or not IS not for the researcher to
judge-at least at tWs stage. Lookmg at the
writmgs content-wise certam subjects, events,
bappenmgs appear to have repeatedly formed
the subject matter of these erutonals. It IS
proposed to examme the more Important of
these subjects separately from drlferent aspects.
To lIst those events or subjects which have
been of such Importance to the student commllDlty and which have been the subject of
so much comment m the edltonaIs, we have
(I) the Institute Gymkhana (2) sports and mter
IIT meet (3) IIT student audience behaVIOur
(4) Staff-student relatlonsmp (5) the IITlan
(6) Compast111leS Itself (,) Intellectual Issues.

Audience Behaviour :
Student behaVIOur at campus fllDctlons, De
It at the cultural week, mOVIes, mter-hostel
entertamments and the like has been a much
commented upon subject m the edltonals.
The comments are almost all derogatoryvarymg only lD degree. The followmg facts
are at once dlscerruble With regard to IIT
student auruences Gettmg a Sizeable crowd
IS m Itself a problem especially where smtable
mcentlVes may be lacking. IIT audiences
are very difficult to please. Whether thIs IS
due to the peyalence of extraorrunarIly high
stalldards or Just pure conceit IS another question to be discussed later. DISpleasure IS
expressed m the normal form of cat~cal1s ..•.
the whole works, WIth no quarter given, be It
a team from another college or some poor
fellow trymg out ms vOice at the mter-hostel
competition. Agamst thIS background It
would be relevant to exam.m.e what dIfferent
editors have had to say. In February 1967
the Editor wrltmg about the commg cultural
week IS mildly derogative about IITmns past
behavIOur and emphasises that a well behaved
audience and success go together HIS successor m November 1967 feels thaqudgmg from
the lIDruly students of the past one could
only keep lus fingers crossed for the mterhostel competItion to be successful. The need
for more tolerance towards the medIOcre and
of gntmg more encouragC1Ilent to buddmg
talent was adVised. The editor of November
1968 finds the normal liTmns' behav10ur
mexplIcable the moment they enter the OAT.
It IS as If ' Boo and Conform' was the rule of
the day.
But apart from bemg UDaDimous m their
censure of 1IDCuly behaVIOur the editors have
neglected to analyse the problem or even
examme the reasons behind thiS behavIOur
More often they are on the Side of the performer advlsmg 'Take what IS dIshed out,
however bad, Without protest' The editor
of February 1970 has an even more scathIDg
attack on IITlans. Lamentmg that the
amateur theatre had (hed a Violent death, the
editor feels that we have lost the essential
mgredlent

WhH.h

make"

for

that Campastimes suffers due to lIDsympathetiC
readers. With a smgle exceptIOn, there
appears to be a general consensUS among
varIOUS editors that nothmg IS wrong With the
paper but somethmg IS lackmg m the readers.
There IS no attempt at self-appraisal but an
overpowermg tendency to blame readers for
the shortcommgs-a tendency which has persisted through the years
Agamst thIS background we could examme
what dIfferent editors have had to say exammmg a report of fallIng standards m the
Campastlmes. The edItor of 1966-67 while
acceptmg that It may be partly true IS of the
opmlOn that bemg a reader's paper ItS qualIty
is detennmed by those very readers. Campastimes could do well WIth more m the way of
artlcles and contnbutlons of which there
appears to be a senous lack
The editorial of September 1967 conveys
the ImpreSSIOn that many readers are not
particularly bothered whether Campasttmes
eXIsted or not. Indeed, many It appears, are
surprised how the magazlfie has managed to
pull along. In refuting such skeptIcal statements the edItor clalIDS that with so much
talent prevallmg wlthm the Campostlmes can
only move forward not back. Readers are
agaIn remmded of thetr obligation and asked
to co-operate not cntlclse
Exammmg the effect of Campasttmes on the
staff the Editor prefers to hold the optimistic
view and hold that the Campastimes could be
instrumental m brmgmg the staff-student
commtmlty closer by Invltmg artIcles from the
Staff The same editor In hiS last Issue IS of
the opInion that to the average IITlan hVIng
in hIS httle narrow world of periodicals and
cucnculum, Campostlmes IS the only lmk to
events m and outSide the Institute. Campastimes may be cursed, described as 'the same
Sick sttrlf from the same bunch of Sick guys',
but these very persons would feel lIDeasy if
they did not get their copy on tIme The
feelmg IS that there is no lack of hterary talent
m the Institute-yet gettmg contnbutlons
takes on the dImenSIOns of a major problem.
Another problem seems to be catenng to
readers who abhor seflOUS ltterature but are
qUite ready to curse attempts to dish our
humour The editOrial of October 1968 1D
a scathmg appraisal of an old problem remlDds
readers that the only way the outSide world
can View IIT IS through Campasttmes and In
the final analySIS It IS the reader whose cooperatIOn Will make the difference It IS hIgh
tIme the potential WrIters shook off their
lethargy and came forward for a cause which
ultImately concerns them The assumption
that CampastImes IS the only medIUm to view
an IITIan IS of course highly questionable but
then most Editors seem to be lIDder that
delUSion
The Campasttmes of Summer 1969 sees the
«htor lD the dock, strongly defendmg himself agamst crItiCism Referring to mlsunderstandmg prev,l.Ihng on the function of
an Edltonal the Editor IS of the opInIon that
It IS essentially the view of one person headmg
a small group To cntlclse IS only a part of
hiS Job-yet essential The average reader,
the editor feels has lIttle or no tlme for unravellmg a SituatIOn and It IS the Editor's Job

"ucce""-

enthu.'lasm all around In IlT It IS entIrely
a question of general cymcism klllmg thL much
deSired enthUSIasm and makmg conceited
boors of IITlans Writing 1D F(.bruary 197 1
after the conclUSion of a typical cultural week
replete With lIDmly behaVIOur the editor
appears to feel that self-conceIted notions of
supenorlty coupled With that CYniCism which
IS so rampant makes the IITlan act as he does
Expressmg dIsgust more strongly than ever
the edltor screams for a change

Campastimes
Perhaps the most popular subject for comment among the various editors hl}s been Campast117U!S Itself Every tdltor, It appears, has
felt duty bound to examme the paper's Impact
on rLaders and comment on Its prospects
There arc sev(.r,,1 pOlnts of SImIlarity between
the vanous edItonals Most are of the opmlOn

SINDBAD
There was a man from Sindbad
who was called
the sailor.
You and I
know why
he wasn't called
the tailor.
(He sailed the seas
but stitched no clothes.)
ANANTH SESHADRI.

In effect the edltonal suggests
that It IS the EdItor's right to CrItIcIze and
e;xpose anythmg and everybody, nobody IS
above condemnatIOn as long as It IS valIdand people had better get reconcIled to the fact.
That a more or less unchanged SItuatIOn eXists
With regards to Compostlmes IS obvIOUS With
the Issue of September 1969' ReVlewmg the
prospects of the paper the EdItor states that
h,s aIm IS to mamtam the eXlstmg standards
and foresees no change In the qualIty of the
paper. Any change In thiS direction would
necessitate a drastiC change In the attitudes
of the student body and there IS a complIcation that such changes are untimely. As If
he had not said enough, we find the Editor
expressmg the same hopes m hIS next Issue.
Another feature that WIll be dealt With m
another section could be mentIon ed hereWhat determmes the content of C41npastlmes.
The Editor admits that smce serIOusness IS
somethmg which any normal IITlan abhors
Campasbmes is by necessity a non-senou~
paper. To wrIte on such problems like
students' SOCial and po!ttlcal conscIousness
would be to say the least, foolhardy ThiS
should remforce the View that If the paper has
an audience at all It IS due to Its essentIally
non-senous nature. It IS obVIOUS that the
Editor IS content to mamtam thiS status quo.
The summer 1972 editortal differs from the
rest In that It gives the magazme generous
pats on the back which are by no means
warranted. WhIle preVIOUS edltonals were at
pams to pomt out that the magazme was not
all that bad. ThIS one unashamedly wallows
1ll self-aggrandIzement. Not satisfied With
thIS It places Itself on a supenor plane which
does not condescend to low humour. Not
satisfied With pralsmg the magazme, the editor
offers a sop to the IITlan by dec1almmg from
the rooftops that he has shed hIS old skm and
come forth \D all hiS new found glory. ThiS
smells SU~plc\(>usly of soft ~oap
And thIS IS
another Item of which the IITlan has
absolutely no use Judgmg from what has
been said m the above column one can only
conclude as to the lmenvlable state of affairs
eXlstmg VIS-a-VIS CampastImes and readers.
A frozen SituatIOn (If we accept what the edltonals reveal) With apparent unconcern on the
part of the readers and VOCiferous condemnation of thiS tendency by the editors True,
readers can contrIbute slgmficantly to the
betterment of a paper but the tendency to
blame readers of the magazme has been defimtely and grossly overdone. That edItors
through the years should repeat the same old
accusatIOns and stop there, certamly reveals
mabllIty to go below the sl.Uface-whlch m an
editor could be somethmg of a serIOUS failIng.
The overndmg tendency among editors, whIch
sadly enough has been passed down the edLtorial hierarchy appears to be ' Don't ask me
why CompastImes IS so-so It IS not my rag.
Go ask my precIOus readers' • So we have the
lIDdeslrable status quo of a student ..' paper
condenmed by the students and ItS student
editor figuratively tarred and feathered over
every Issue. The editor In tum, turns the
heat on the students 1D hiS editOrIal, adoptmg
the supenor aIr and dec.ymg the baser mstmcts
of the readers who do not apprecl8te true art
when they see It ThiS VICIOUS cycle has been
continued through the years and there seems
no way out of It
10 do thiS.

Institute Gymkhana
Our rev,cw would not be complete Without
a word on thIS body whIch by all nghts should
be a matter of conSiderable concern to the
I1Tlan
But surprIsmgly
enough the
Gymkhana does not appear to have been as
, hot' a tOpiC wah varIOUS editors as one might
have expected. The few editors who have
contributed to thiS sectIOn make no bones
about their feehngs and the httle they have
wnttcn IS suffiCIent to give a rather dlsappomtmg Image of the Gymkhana as It has been
fWlctlonmg. The edltonal of November 1968
presents the Gymkhana as an unholy mess
With everyone thoroughly dIsenchanted With
ItS functIOnIng The trouble With the
Gymkhana IS the eXIstence of too many commlttt.es WIth too httle control, leadmg to a
fragmented structure The edltonal actually
SCreams for Immediate reorgamsatlon of thiS
Sick body.
