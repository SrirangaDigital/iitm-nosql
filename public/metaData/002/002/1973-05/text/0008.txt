EARTH
, Listen'
By the !>Ide at a grey black strIP of tar we
l>toppcd our walkmg and let the silence and
then the sounds that Silence contaInS, seep m
gently Trees breathmg long breaths In the
wmd, birds ftywg over the dark green and
brown ficld~ cnsscrossed all over until the
honzoll and beyond and poo\s of water shmy
soft blue
All these VOices and greetrngs
wordless and soud less trom earth tellmg you
dbout herself aml ~oftly.
You are a part of everythmg and everythmg's
a part of )OU
On the road, where all the paraphernalra
of large crowds of people hVlllg close to each
other are not there, earth IS all around you
So III spaces uncluttered by bUlldmgs and
fences you know that you are not an alIen
IlVmg In a plastic bubble but a bemg, a person,
a part of the energy stream that meadows,
water, mud, plants, '\lnd and fire and other
people are III And these thmgs, these natural
thmgs feel so real aln e and elemental and you
koo" that hVlllg surrounded by paraphemla
all your mstlllcts and nottOns about how to get
around have changed from what they were
long years ago when your ancestors lived In
Nature Like \\alkmg alone at mght In the
fields between vdlage and Village you know
wh.ere you are and \\ hat t1me It 11> from famlhar
lakes, rocks, trees and ,tars From the Sun
and the Moon the clouds and the sky wm the
answers to the questIOns who, where, how and
why And there are no paths over which you
can't go Your feet aren't forced to walk
along ngldly fixed roads asphalted and neonht,
It'S lIke there are ail those directions radIatmg
from your feet outwards until mfilllty and you
can walk or run anywhere and each step takes
a different drrectlOn It's an lllCredIDlly free
feelmg To see emptmess and fee! silence
only the sky and the hOrIzon always so far
away, fresh clean cool au InSIde, hke thIS, IS
bemgalive
