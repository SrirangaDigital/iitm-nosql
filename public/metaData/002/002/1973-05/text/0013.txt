Morality ••• (contd.)
One aspect of morahty IS ' The art of hvmg
Jl1 Society'. Mor,\!lty IS consIderation for
others It IS learmng to walk wIthout steppulg
on other people's toes Society IS af&cted .n
some way or the other by anytlung we do.
We carmot be happy unlcss people around US
are happy And society IS the basIc umt III
our world to-day But thiS does not mean
that the mdIVldual has to und<-rgo hardslups
and subjugate hmlself and lose his lfidlvldualtty
In socIety. SOCial morahty .md individual
moraltty are altogether different and yet mterImked m many ways Now, With regard to
sOCIal moralIty, It I~ essential that we leanl to
live With others for the peace and progrc,s of
socIety Today almost cveryonc td.lk~ enth~lastlcally about a Untted World But
how call thIS UnIted World be created~ wlless
And
we learn to hve WIth our nelghbour~
thiS IS sOCial morality A UUlted World
would remam an UtopIa unless we work for It.
It IS socIety that has brought 11\ a number of
new aspects to morality For a Robmson
Crusoe alone m hIS desert 1~land, a whole lIst
of good and evil deeds could be excluded He
could not murder, steal, Conlnllt adultery, he
or covet another man's posseSSIOns, he could
neither be merciful, kmd nor Just It IS
sOCiety wh\ch created these qualities and as
society changes, morC problems reqUiring
gUIdance from morahty WIll anse
As for IndiVIdual moraltty, It has great
slgmficance tn our attempts to reach the ultt~
mate As I o:ald eariter, every wrong deCISIOn
retards our progress PhYSIcal pleasure IS
probably the most hotly debated subject re~
gardmg IndlVldual Morality Ot course thIS
does have SOCIal mlphcatlOns whICh people
recogmze as havmg to do WIth SOCIal morahty.
But how does It affect your IndIVidual
moralIty? PhYSIcal pleasure IS baSically
transIent It does afford us pleasure but It
doesn't last long How then can we remam
content With only transient happmess?
Surely all of IV> want perpetual happmess.
ThIS tranSient happmess IS then certamly
not our answer But then how does thiS
transIent happllless affect our progress towards our perpetual happmess ~ It post~
pones It consIderably because the euphor~a
for the perpetual We tend to believe that
euphOrIa IS perpetual happmess. But then In
our le~s euphonc moods we realize It IS not
so, and we have to "tart all over agam It IS
here that moralIty lends a steadymg mfluence
on us. As I saId, once we reach the ultImate,
we don't need morahty. We would be ever
happy, and that happmess may have nothtng
to do WIth phYSIcal or even mental happmess,
but It would be somethIng which would be
unrecogmzable now at thIS stage of our
development. The concept of happmess Itself could be different, but It would be somethmg perpetual
We could go back the way we came, back to
the ktngdom of ammals, and perhaps we are
tempted as In the words of Walt WhItman,
who mused
, I could tum and hve With the anlmllIs,
They are so plaCid and self-contamed,
I stand and look at them long and long,
They do not sweat and whme about their
condltton,
They do no he awake IJl the dark
And weep for their smS '
If we are ready to go back, then we can gIVe
up morahty. Agam, If we attaIn the ultunate,
we don't need morality, UntIl then we are
wedded to morality.

A memorable year 18 now treadmg Its last
weary yet jubIlant steps
Memorable?
Well, It'S difficult to deny facts ThIS year
saw lIT MDS reap a h'uvest of successes
unsurpassed It has been a year of performances par excellence FIve team~ acquItted
themselves admIrably In the mter-colleglate
The cncket and football teams reachmg the
semi-finals and the hockey and basketball
teams the finals of the MeA A league ThiS
IS the first time we have been zonal champIons
m so many games The sWlmmmg team WIth
theIr meagre resources performed bnlltantly
to take th'· Tunnus-up berth III the mtecollegldte chdmplOnshlp
The foeu~ of attention has however been
on the pre<;tlglous 9th IlltCT-I I T meet.
MDS were m an Irreslstable mood In a
devastating three days, we hdd Illdl~plltable
sway over, the rest of the I IT's

If even d. smgle figure e,er domlllated an
mter-I I T meet, Jt w'as lIone other than that
athlete par excellence-Narender Kumar
Breakmg "IX records and equalhng one more,
Narendcr carned tne day HIS supremacy
was never In doubt And as record after
record went crashmg down, tnc crowd recovered from their number~ to acclaIm a new
hero A stleJ1t, unassummg pIece of dynamIte.
But Narender's hour ot glory was not when he
was smashmg records No, hiS hour of glory
was In the 4- X 400 m relay No-one had gIVen
MDS much of d. chance u\ thiS race. And the
gloomy predIctIOns seemed true as MDS
lagged 35 m to +0 m behmd leaders KGP
m the fourth and final lap KGP seemed to
be headmg for a certalll • gold', the home
crowd was hystencal But then one had to
reckon With Nareudra who was anchor man
for MDS He rapidly closed the gap It
was now the turn of the MDS guys to shout.
15 m -10 m -5 m slowly agomsmgly
Narendcr was bnngmg off the ImpOSSible
And sure enough on the curVe he overtook the
KGP rurmer and sped a\,ay towards the finish

espeCIally S1l\ce the KGP guys do the 4-00 m.
m under 52 sees ,
The Alankar though gIVIng coverage to the
matches had a tendency to omIt certam excltmg
matches Pohteness forbIds me to make any
comments Anyway to fill III the blanks
and do JustIce to our guys I WIll touch upon
them. The' bumper' match was the hockey
final between MDS and KGP The odds
were heaped very much agamst us But
then (wIthout bemg caustIc) home grounds are
not everythIng From the word go, our guys
put on the pressure Though we dommated
most of the exchanges, we had our moments
of arunety too. In defence RaJagopal and
Borzorgl were superb Wlule DaVId and
Raghu kept pushmg the forward lIne, Chlkkl
ran through time and agam It was befittIng
that weWOJ1.
Shuttle matches have qUIte often been cliffhangers The KGP-MDS semI-final was no
less With our smgles players havmg cramps,
the match came to centre around the doubles.
But newcomers Madan and Kumar (our
doubles pall:), were In a ruthless mood,
especLally the former. With merciless shots
and drops MDS won this match and subsequently entered the finals
I would not be domg Justice to this narrative
if I dId not mentwn Jayant, Chandran,
KrIshnan, Shorty and Laxmmaraynan. Their
performances
were
superlatIve.

The athletics guys must be commended on
a neat lIttle mche they have carved for themselves Except for the 100 m., MDS had a
mUllmum of three pomts from every event
The third and final day saw us go down III
three finals but these reverses could III no way
hamper us from retammg the general champIOnshIp The meet was over Our performances III the last two meets had been no
flash III the pan From dawn to du~k we had
held the crowds spellbound, filled them WIth
awe. Through all the academIC turmotl, the
chaos and uncertamty we had persevered, and
perscvercncc had won out
In endmg thiS mSlpld (mslpld as tt can tn
no way convey the excitement nor the sense
of achIevement) and wretched (for It IS too
small) narratIve, I must not forget two promment figures who did so much for our

Dear Editor
It v.as rather shockmg to reed your edLtorlal

Messrs. GOYUldaraJan & Asthana,
I am sorry I did not make myself more clear
m my edItOrial (Vol XI No 3) and If you have
.........."'....rpTcled. or completely missed the key
argument put forth m that wntmg, 1 ~hall take
only a small part of the blam(. for havtng left
the obvIOUS unsaId I ha,e great faIth III the
Impitclt I do not \\Ish to capltahze on the
subject of nomenclature and the handouts for
fear of bemg branded a naive person
I am sure I would have consulted you
before saymg anythmg about staff-evaluation
and course-evaluation and the lIke. But I
dId not, because I was not wntmg about these
thmgs I wanted to say that thiS course was
Just not necessary for any self-respectmg
engmeer, and courses whIch mclude a great
deal of general psychology had better be left
alone m thiS (here) UT.
I am very thankful of course for the figures
you have appended to your letter and I am
glad that over 50% of the students who have
undergone dus course gIVen by you, rated you
excellent and good Also, I notice there IS
cause for JubIlatIon III the data emergmg from
the course-evaluatIOn bit But before any~
one does that, I would hke to pomt out that
the QuestIonnaIre was IIlcornplete In so far as
It could not have gIven us, WIth any degree of
accuracy, an answer to the very, very Important
question, which IS Was thIS COUrse relevant
to out B.Tech CurrIculum here, and If not
why not? Either the questIOnnaire people
were not aware of thIS aspect of the evaluation
procedure or were Just afraId to ask. And
therefore, I tend to suspect the data supplied
by you and I WIsh to treat them as Just so many
figures, and I am sure my readers WIll under~
stand tlus
Fmally, 1 WIsh to clarIfy that we are not
spreadmg rumours about the Industrial
Psychology Course (fine rumours that they
would make), nor does Campastlmes pubhsh
fictItIouS stones, espeCIally, m Its edltonals.
