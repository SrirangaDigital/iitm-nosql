Summer 1973]

A mirror-Image of that soanng mner flash
Where realrty and VlSlOn mCl:'ge lIke qUIck-sIlver,
Then from the worthy dust that maketh man
Is born a eommunlon wIth another dust
That marble sheds hke dandruff when It wakens
As though to teIl the world, In Story qwckness
Of the ease WIth which It can be set ahve
By the sImplest of chlsel-wleldmg creatures.
(ThiS wag-tall work of mme seemeth all-WIse
Romn:
Even as the fabled owl) And what my own surptlse
That my creation makes me seem an aged fool.
Thinker : Yes, lord, but note the room temperature
Almost three degrees below the zero
And hke It o[ not, your creation IS no hero.
Who can contmue to pseudo-thmk whtle nude
While the frigId all" keeps nlppmg at hIS VItalS.
For a statue, thy VlInlty IS remarkable, lad
Rodin:
Here, coyer thyself, and thmk of me, unclad.
Knowmg beauty then, to merge WIth It, to fUl>e
And skip m wonderment from shapely stone to stone
Like some unbridled mustang of the skIes
Let loose to graze on a meadow of mfinlte acreage,
Shall we, In thiS brref tnterlude of freedom, make
A gentle trtp, a qUIck SOjourn to that pure lake
Of exotIc cerebral adventure' explore beyond thiS

The JITIAN System
The llT educatIOnal system has come m
for muc.ll cntlclsm III the past year. There
were qUite a few articles on how It could be
unproved, there was a semmaI' on It organised
by the Leo Club and of course Innumerable
after-dmner diSCUSSions m the hostels The
suggestions were many and often qUIte
dtfferent from each other. However they all
had one common feature-reduce the number
of penodlcals Or aboltsh them altogether To
me, that seems corny thlJlkmg Before you
start throwmg stones at me conSider the
follOWIng pomts m favour of scrappmg the
final exammatlons.
PerIod,cals cover, or are meant to cover, a
lImited portion thoroughly The semester
exanunatlOn for the most part covers III a
general way what the pertodu:als have already
covered m detail. So the rIght thmg to do
would be to have another cycle of penodlcals
In place of the semester ex:unmahons whIch
covers the portion covered after the third
cycle. To make the periodicals mon' effect",ely cover the portH)flS, Increase theIr duration to say 75 mmutes We could take the
best three for calculatmg the final grade. To
prevent favGutltlSln, we could have two people
correctmg the papers separately and sendmg
m the marks to the AdmmlstratIve Block
mdependently We could take the average
of the two except where there IS a larg.: dls~
panty In marks 111 which case It could either
be corrected by a thIrd lecturer who has not
handled the class or get It recorrected by the
ongmal two lecturers. After all there are
lectures aplenty In each department.
If however four perIodicals are too gceat a
workload for the lecturers, we could reduce
the number to three and take the best two.
ThIS would leay>! a greater gap between the
cycles of perIodlcals and hence more ex;traCUTflcu\ar activIties can be conducted
The semester exammatJon lS an anachro~
msm we are best rId of When we rejected
the outmoded concept of a whole year's work
bemgJudged on the baSIS of one annual examl~
nation m favour of the semester system, we
chose to come m hne WIth the most modern
thmkmg m educatIOn. But as In most other
thmg" we have not been brave enough to
mak" a clean break The hme for change 18
now. It IS absurd to retaID anachrolllsms and
we as buddmg technologIsts must be the first
to realIse it

CAMPASTIMES
DeposIt of drudgery, wall of rotting cannab,s,
And seeping forth with the exuberance of a gas
Released from the stunttng confines of a sac
Cavort, do handsprmgs In the wmd, and totter fortb
In moodless stupour, mad abandon. random ecstacy?

AT ASOCIAL GATHERING
They were all there, bless theJIl. the local elite
Some were dressed In black and some m whIte
There was some amplIfied musIc gomg all around
As though. to trample out the busy human sound
The free-speakmg men now speak of thmgs mane
One Vies WIth another, as the vOIces WIDe and wane
A pale-skmned gIrl was laughmg ltke a siren
And three sohcltous males hovered about her
Each WIth hIS gwnmed-on snnle, eager to be heard
Have you seen the mOVie yet? NO,llot yet, reply.
There came a hvened man, then, servmg dnnks
And people reached out casually. hands unwavermg
Controlled movements: remember, this IS a crowd
The expressIonless server of drinks went around
As though he was a bull-dozer mowmg through
A field npplmg With the passage of the wrod
Stlken rustles and the stench of perfumes
Went tnppmg past the gate, where cars were parked.

Tutonals are eft'echve as a poroter to a
student's abIlIty If and only If the tutonal
classes are small (IO to IZ students Ideally)
and handled by a tutor who IS really Interested
m the students. However tutonals m the
semor classes (m the first and second years
at least the batches were small, though by no
flIght of unagmatlon can the tutors be called
Illterested) are conducted en 1llasse, I.e. the
whole class of around 60 as handled by a
couple of lecturers who give the class the
tutonal sheet contaUlUlg about four or five
problems 'the students are to work on them
and are asked to submit them eIther at the
end of the class (In whIch case mass coggmg
takes place m class) or m the next class (m
which case mass coggmg takes place In the
hostels) On the bas1s of thiS, the lecturer IS
expected to gIve tutorial grades. He does so
more often than not m an arbitrary fashion
resultmg m the qUlet, honest workers gettlllg
low grades. At best there IS a tlltonal test at
the end WhlCh. IS lust another periodical WIth
one difference-It IS much easICr to cog mit.
Agreed that the students al1' as much to blame
as the staff for thlS sorry state of affairS but
that IS no defence. There are only two alternatIves-either dJV'lde the class mto small
batches and have mterested staft' to handle
them or scrap tutonal grades. Let them be
just problem-solvmg and doubt-c1eanng
classes.
L'lbs are a necessIty but lengthy reports are
an absurdity. Apart from helllg a waste of
tune-the student learns httle as he cogs
desperately eIther from a book or from another
rep:Jrt on the eve of the lab~ratory class--hey
Comtltute an unnecessary work load on the
staft' Tne purplse w(Juld b'! b'!tter served If
the student IS glven In advance the lIst of
exp~runents Wlth detatls of each expenment.
At the end of the each expenm~nt the student
could be asked to submit the calculatlOns, and
anSW>!f a few qUestLOns on the exp~runent.
On the blSIS of these mini-VIvaS and probably
a w(lt~en test-cum-VIva at the end, the
student s p~rformlnce can b~ evaluated

Parevvell
WIthOut bemg sentImental, I regret that
I too, must now tread those last weary steps
1 talked of elsewhere m thiS rag. Lookmg
back r can say that most of us have learnt a
lot III the way of skills and guIles of our games,
But the basiCS remam. You play the game
whether the other SIde IS stronger or not.
What the hell, we play anyway for 1t IS better
to have played and lost, than not to have played
at aU. ThiS year's brllhance 111 the sports
arena IS a dream come true for many of us.
It was a last ditch battle for supremacy, for
Immortahty. But It wtU be a transient un~
mortality for several years hence we WIll have
receded mto the darkness, the vagueness of
obliVion. Old achIevements must make way
for the neW. That's the law of natlU"e. But
the expenence, the thnll wtll remam WIth us
for a long time. It's not every day that a
dream comes true. One day we are gomg to
look back at thl!; one year, at our Camelot.
And m that deep future It wtll aU come back,
from the dark recesses of obl1vlOn, lLke a WISP
of a faded memory. As Tee Square put It so
Movmgly
, Ask every person 1£ he's heard the story
And tell It loud and clear If he has not,
That once there was a fieetmg wisp of
glory •... nor
L'!t It be forgot that once there was a spot
For one bnef shmmg moment that was
known as Camelot.'
We leave thiS Camelot behmd us with the
fervent hope that the gllest for newer achIevements, neW.':r Camelots WIll contmue even
when our Camelot IS but a vague blur on the
hom-:on a shadow III the hackground. Best
of Luck
In plssmg I take thiS opportumty to thank
on behalf of us sportsmen a certam personality
who has done more than dllty reqUires of him.
He has remamed In the background and done
for us what no-one else could have. I talk
of none other than Mr Joga Rao (P.T I.). He
has encouraged us and bas borne the brunt of
the burden for so long These thanks are
long overdue to hIm and we extend 1t to hun
WIth all our hearts. Tllanks a lot'
PATEL.
