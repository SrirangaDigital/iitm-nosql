THE GENERAL SECRETARY'S
Report for 1972 73
Mr. & Mrs Easwaran, ladles and gentlemen,
It IS my privilege today to present to you
the annual report of the Gymkhana for the
year 1972-73.
This year we have been fortunate to have
a hard workmg and efficient steermg committee, and most lmportant an understandmg
and tireless president. The Student Council
which IS a representatIOn of the hostels and
the vanous courses was not able to meet
often because of lack of time, but on those
few occasions on which It did meet we were
happy to find a considerable mcrease In the
constructive partiCipation of the post-graduates.
It IS my smCere hope that thiS trend wdl
grew for the years to come. As the gymkhana
does not have a constitution It wa:, decided
tlus year to draw broad gutdelmes to enable
it to function more effiCiently.
For the first time this year students were
granted representation m the council of
wardens. The post of Mess Co-ordmatmg
Secretary has been created this year to prOVide
a lmk between the vanous hostel messes, the
Council of Wardens and the central supplies.

In the field of sports lIT Madras has had
one of the most successful years ever. We
won the Inter-lIT Sports Meet at Kharagpur
for the second year m successlOn though we
had to travel across half the country to KGP
via Bombay, because of the trouble m Andhra.
Our sportsmen very convmcmgly asserted
their superiority. No mentIOn of a sports
meet IS complete WIthout the mentioning
Narendrakumar who IS an athlete of the
highest cahbre. This year at KGP he smashed
the records In 6 out of the 7 events he
partiCipated. He also has the dlstlncuon
of haVIng represented Tamil Nadu State ID
the Inter State-Meet and the Nationals.
The One that must be mentIOned 10
connection With lIT's successful year In Sports
IS the Basketball team. They have won
numerous tournaments both m the city and
other places Also outstandIng were the
hockey, football and sWimming teams which
were runner-up m the Madras City Intercollegiate league. Our athletiCS, basketball
and cncket teams took part in the InterVarsity tournaments and performed creditably.
Tlus year second strmg teams have been
formed In all the sports With a view to tillIng
the vacuum that may be created when thIS
final year batch graduates. It IS my smcere
hope that thiS Investment m tune and effort
will pay nch dJvldends.

In the cultural and literary field, we have been
no less successful. Our Debating team won

variOUS contests held at CJty colleges. SpeCial
mention must be made of B. Kumar who
won the much coveted prize In the debate
orgamzed by Indo-American Chamber of
Commerce. Our QUIZ team walked away
With the rolhng trophy and the shield for the
PG and UG qUIz held by the Madras SCience
AsSOCiation and also won the QUIZ at MMC.
If I were to dwell on all the tnumphs of
IITlans m the other Cultural and Literary
Competition I would have neither the time
nor the words left for much else and so I
must leave some of our victOries unsung.
However as is usual the focal prInt of lIT's
Literary and Cultural actiVities being the
Cultural week I will pause for a moment on
that thought Though partiCipatIon this year
was less than In the prevIOus years the
students were as high as ever. In my
opinion particIpation would have been better
of the Colleges outSide were else skeptical
about the response of the lIT audience and
If our external affairs Secretary had done his
bit m promotmg better understandwg between
IlS and the City colleges.

For the first time this year lIT was
represented Its all events 10 the all India
Cultural festival held at liT KNP and
the Youth Festival held at Stella MariS.
IIT walked off With the prizes of the
best actor, best vocahst and best speaker.
This year has seen an unprecedented growth
m the actiVItIes of the lIT Dramatics
Club-two of their plays bemg well receive
m the city newspapers.

In the field of fine arts we have set a few
trends thiS year. College and on the spot
sketchmg were mtroduced m the cultural
festival. The photographiC club has been
functlonmg very effiCiently and Its members
have taken part In vanous photogcaphlc
CompetitIons all over India.
In my maugural address I had promIsed
an overhaulmg of the present transport system
in lIT, Madras. Prof. Ravlndran, an expert
In OperatIOn Research has gone mto Its
detaJis and has come up wlth an mClSlve
report which I hope Will be implemented In
the near future. With the lmplementatlon
of hiS suggestion I am sure transport wdl
cease to be the bug-bear It has been so far.
The Institute lorry has been remodelled and
wdl be assigned exclllSJVely to Gymkhana.
The Institute electlOns, I feel, must be
held pOSitively by the beginnmg of August
so that- the Instltute Gymkhana can function
effectively for a larger penod of time.

Institute Day

ChIef Guest

Sports Day

For a larger time now both the Students and
Staff have had reasons to complain about the
infleXible rigidity of the acadwlIc programme.
Actmg on nemerOus suggestions that I have
received and submit that a break-off from the
academiC routine dunng the semester be
gIven In the form of say a week's hohday.
ThIS Will not only have the deslfable effect
of enabling students who are academIcally
behind to reonent themselves and catch up
wlth the programme but should also provide
students from the north opportumtles for
Sight-seeing tours BeSides, the staff will
also have the opportumty to recoup lind
catch their breath I request the Senate to
seriously conSider the posslblhty of arranging
such a let-off.
Another pomt which IS well made IS that
the students who have to write supplementary
exams are very often left hangmg In suspense
regardmg their results ThiS Will have the
unhealthy effect of abstractmg thelf concentration from the current semester work
and programme.
I therefore urge the
authonues to ensure that the results of the
supplementary exams are announced as soon
as humanly pOSSible which should be definitely
faster than It IS at present Mter all even
hell With a dear, fast break is better than
heaven With a prolonged stay ID purgatory.
In retrospect, It has been a thumpingly
successful vear for the IDsbtute. For thiS I
would like to extend my sincere thanks to
Dr. Ramachandran, Prof. R. K. Gupta and
the other offiCials of the staff who have gone
with us all the way. To the legIOn of selfless
workers who have striven tirelessly for the
Institute I can only extend my smcere thanks
on behalf of the Gymkhana.
Thank you.
