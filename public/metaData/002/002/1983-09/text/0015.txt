Are the silent, anguished remnants of memories
That, once impregnated with meaning, held a
future:
Hollowed futures of desolate retreats
That crushed into the blood-veins of
fiery aloneness o
The dread sway of passionless pursuits
Materialising into momentous memories
Forcing the cloistered heart to renounce
its claim on aloofness
And admit in reluctant painful compulsion
That defeat is never a one-way dimension,
The echoes that recur resounding to a
violent throbbing miasmao
Breathing hailstorms then o
The crushed soul of ruthless coldness
Stirs abroad and admits the anguish of 10ss o
Paved paths deviate into drilling destinies
And graveyards groan their gloating mysteries
While the tears of mortality brew a tale
Bursting at the rims to explode o
And the springs of language are shut into
caverns of truth
Where eyes, refused admittance, move ono

If your human flaws of ice-like solidity
Shattered and torn, lie embittered,
And, messing up your frustrated futures
You deign to look back once again,
You behold the silent, wounded, exposed
lie of a mask o
Madhavi Menono

We love insisting we are strange
creatures - we detest anything run-of-themillo We exist in this form, Homo Zapiens,
only for 270 days a year. Most of us exist
for 5 years - a new generation of 4-yearCreatures has recently sprung up - some
are gifted longevity and last 10 or 12
years! Everytime we leave this secluded
isle of ours, we undergo a curious form
of psychological and physical moulting,
reverting to o~dinary human forms.
