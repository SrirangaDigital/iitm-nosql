The turtle was an extra terrestrial,
the sea, space, and the palace, a planet ..
How else could the ancient Japanese
have explained this strange phenomenon?
When time passes much more slowly for a
man who is travelling than for the world
he leaves behind 7 it on'y means he must be
moving at a speed close to that of light.
And this observation, faithfully
preserved and passed on, tells us that space
travel had indeed taken place, beyond a
shadow ('\f doubto
Story-tellers may make up almost anything 7 but it is highly improbable for
anyone to have made up such an accurate
account of the phenomenon of time dilation
(u"nknown to us until Y2 a century ago),
which is why I think the story is true.
Urashima didn't go with a turtle into
the sea, he went into space with. an extra

G. C. PY'CI~ad

Measly melancholy that strikes again ..
And daring, desperate, I wound
Towards the dullening draught of pain-killer
Easing the pain that creeps in again
When the dose of destruction loses its spell,
And there dwell again on the forgotten hopes
Of my once-intoxicated lunacy.
Mis-spelling the bleak future of those
rainbow hopes,
Aqony passed on in tortuous sudden transpositions
Now to gnaw with claw - ridden unmitigated
poison,
Seep;ng into the veins of sense and breatho
Cheaply-won affections of a defrauded
decanter
That yielded nothing in emptiness o
Crashing on the misty glass - panes of a
frosty noon,
On a Wind-blown weather-beaten mansion of
isolation
Set, against a desolate landscape of
bitterness
