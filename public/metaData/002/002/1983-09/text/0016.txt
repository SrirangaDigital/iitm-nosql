The Darwinian Laws of Natural Selection
do not apply to our species. There are the
Ivery successful (Form S) and the very unsuc: cessful (Form U)-these forms coexist admirably in symbiotic harmonyo As everything's

Recent studies show evidence of the
existance of a thin layer of ironoxide
{more commonly called rust}, that evelops
the greycell matter of both forms of Zapiens o
Though the evidence is not very convincing,
IForm U is said to have a thicker layer of
,rust. Causative agents range from laziness to

a marked lack of external stimuli. Most
re~earchers agree that, strangely, climatic
conditions here have very little to do with

We have an amazing penchant for short
spells of hibernation, during the day - the

season not a governing criterion. Statistics
show that 1 0 00 pm to 5.00 pm (all days of
the week) is the dangerous period. Under
controlled conditions in a lab, attempts
were made to ~uash this trait by injecting
Drawing, Laborutory and Work-shop from
1 0 00 to 4030 pm-a disastrously unsuccessful
experiment. The chemicals acted as soporifieso The experiment is still on - I wish
theln luck. Studies also showed that this
habit of ours has no deleterious effect on

As a species we take pride in the fact
that we are favoured to snatch the "Hardiest
