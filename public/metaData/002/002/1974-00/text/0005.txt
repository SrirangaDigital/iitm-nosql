All this summer you taught me—'
how to unwind myself

(I had known no other summer),
how to learn to love nature,
to appreciate music and timelessness.
In this process of reformation—

I learnt simple pleasures to ﬁll my empty soul
I forgot my loneliness and followed your shadow.
Oblivious of your ego and intentions,

When summer sought its end,
I realized summer was the shortest season.
How‘many times I had told myself I love him.
All I needed from you was a single gesture of
comprehension.
