imagined that he had found for himself every possible
nuance of beauty and wonder on his canvas, priding himself on his inspiration and understanding all these many
years, and suddenly here was a mere child, a wisp of a
girl, who could put him to shame and humiliation wordlessly and without even knowing what she had done.

are a simple woman, but a wise one. There are young
children in the world who, like your Rusa, have inside their
souls, a touch of silver. These young ones may sometimes

have sudden spells and lose themselves in their own imaginations because of the power with which they are drawn by
their souls-forces. Many mothers think that their sons or .
young daughters are not right in the mind and their hearts
are full of sorrow, especially if their stupid doctors tell
them that nothing is wrong and laugh at them. Of course,
nothing is wrong, but the child understands and senses
everything too early and too strongly in visions. Sometimes
these visions can make the child very happy, so happy in
fact, that he or she will prefer to remain that way as long
as possible. It is good if the child is left alone to be with his
silver—touched happiness. Your Rusa is avision-sensitive
girl. She is lucky to be so. Even though I have struggled
for so many years to infuse the world with my colours and
my hard imagination, I would give anything to be like
Rusa, but I cannot be so.

Somewhat exhausted by this long exposition, the old man
sat down and stared at his recently ﬁnished canvas. Rusa,
who had been watching his lips move in articulating the
words, sat on his knee, ﬁngers of one hand in her mouth,
the other hand holding on to his beard for support. A
butterﬂy, large, yellow and mottled, caught her eye, and she
gazed at it until the small black dot on its wing grew larger
and rounder then changed into a huge ﬁeld of deep purple
like the sun when you look straight into it with closed
e es.
