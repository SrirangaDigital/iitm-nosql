EOITORIAL~'_
Over the past few years apathy regarding CAMPASTIMES has 1ncreased as fast as its quality
has declined.
Interest in and enthusiasm for its continuance has touched rock bottom indeed it cannot go down any further. When we went around soliciting articles, we were
always faced by the reply, "Campastimes 1 Is i t still alive?" It is very nearly true.
Campastimes is in its death throes. We are hoping to improve this dismal conception and
possibly resurrect the magazine. As we have found out, it has not been an easy task
this far.
We assumed our posts extremely late, uncomfortably close to the end of the semester.
The extreme academic pressure at the end of the semester has attempted to preclude our
total involvement in our work and has in fact succeeded in doing so to some extent. In
this connection we owe our full gratitude to Dr.V.RadhaKrishnan, our publisher. Without
his encouragement and support this issue could not have existed even on paper.
For the first time a new process of production has been tried out. The scope for
elegance in presentation has been definitely limited. However, we felt that the quality
of the reading matter was more important and this we have done our best to improve. We
will not voice the familiar complaint that the articles were too few. After the initial
static friction, contributions started arriving until we were able to select and publish
from them. This is a healthy trend. We hope that more and varied contributions will be
forthcoming for the future issues. Nevertheless there is no need for complacency. We may
have made a beginninq, we do not know. If we have, it is upto all of us to see that this
small e nthusiasm is not frittered away.
We welcome sugqestions and criticisms fron. all of you about the nature of CAMPASTIMES
and its other details.
