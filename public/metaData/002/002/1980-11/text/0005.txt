-sit is not difficult to imagine that not all the remnant 'establishmentarian' malcontents
would have spilled over to 'A.D.E' when the latter was resurgent and this would have led to a
further division of classes.Of course,no mode of existence would have been possible if one did
not jump on to one bandwagon or another.

One could,without sounding presumptuous/rename U.S.A. as'Uncle Sam's Avenues' .Uncle
Sam is a modern and somewhat
inverted version of the hoary,frost-bitten andl benign Santa
Claus.Santa Claus/one remembers,sneaks into a house thro' the chimney top and leaves a'Jack-inthe-box' surprise for the sleeping children.But poor (?) Uncle Sam is indeed intruded upon,
one barges into his bedroom in an undignified fashion, wakes him up and proceeds to wheedle
him out of his gifts,This is especially true of Indian students aod the genre commands a good
population in lIT's.It is said that a man who si~ly'bums' around here~$logs out his private
parts' and 'works like a bull' when he goes to U.~.A. The point is that if Ivor Brown were to
compile a book called 'Gobbledygook-IITian style' ,he would certainly prefer a 'bullock' in the
place of a 'bull' ,since this would be more consistent with the import of the other statements.
By the way, one feels that John Bull is still something of a martinet.He is more jealous of
gifts than Uncle Sam can ever hope to be.
It is always convenient to ~ismiss :·~ertain threat as the proverbial 'paper tiger'
But there is nothing more terrible :ran
when a rhyme or just the lack of it becomes
a piercing reality. Ben Johnson and John Sylvester were quipping at each othertfirouqn ~oetry
John Sylvester wrote to Ben Johnson the following couplet.
'I , John Sylvester
Lay with your:_sister'
Johnson wrote back,
• I, Ben Johnson
Lay with your wife'
John Sylvester thought that he had got the better of Ben Johnson and triumphantly beamed at
him when they met after some time.
'Johnson, what you have written is no rhyme'.
A calm Johnson told him,
'Dear friend. I

agree it is no rhyme, but it is true.

Perhape simplicity is man's most exa~gerated posture.To keep it up. requires that man
compromises his elastic limits. The bearded convenor Manu ,convenor of the constitution commi ttee should have provided certain • c;e;-emonial' clauses in tILe constitution • At least a
flowing robe, deepl\l hued, wOllld be in order for a councillor to wear as an official vestment.
It is a sense of personal importance that makes a man look sombre and dignified.SuCh members of
the SAC who presently belong to the noble school of 'Absenteeism'would attend more meetinqs
as they would have something nobler to do.- discussing something of public importance in a frilly
apparel rUbbing against their sides. It is good to remember that love takes on its romantic colours
only when a 'snipped taffeta' man kisses the delicate, perfumed han~of aneRquisitely brocaded
woman. In their case one would certainly prefer 'their eyes were bejwelledwith tears' to a more
plebian 'they cried'.

Everybody has heard of the number_1729,
popuiarly known as the Ramanujam number.
The property of the above number is that
it is the smallest number that can be
expressed as the sum of two ~ubes ~n two
d~ffere~t ways i.e. 1729 e 1
+ 12 =
9 + 10 • The ~econ9 Ram~nuja~ number is
4104. 4104 = 2 +16 = 9 +15. The
question is are there any numbers that can
be expressed as the sum of four cubes in
four different ways. The answer is YEs.
Can you find at least one?
Solution:
A possible answer was contain~d in the
article iteself. Multiply the two
Ramanujam numbers 1729 and 4104 to yield

I wonder if 7095816 is bhe smallest such number.
One could use the computer to find that, any way.
