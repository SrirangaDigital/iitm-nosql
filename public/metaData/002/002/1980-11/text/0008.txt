-BC- What do you think happens after death? Do organisms disintegrate?
B - That's it. When I die, I die. Therefore I would like to do whatever I can in this
life. I would like to leave things back by which 1 shall be remembered,be a good manso that
people will remember me wilh affection. That's life and that's the way I would ljke to live.
C - The most competent technological manpower is collected in the lIT's and other sister
Institutions. From the point of view of our country, it i8 sad that a large part of them go
abroad and do not return. Do you feel that this is due to certain wrong policie. of our
government, some weaknesses?
B-1 think it is simply because for 95% of those who get out of our universities,their
commitment' to Sch'nce and Technology is very little1 they are only interested in making
money. This is bo ne out by the fact that out of Indian scientiets and technologists who
go abroad, a very small number ever reach the top. They all simply work as glorified
technicians. Their value system is so warped, that I'm frankly not sorry to lose them.
The only thing that I'm sorry about ie that the government has epent money on them and
deprived somebody else. If they would pay back all the money that was spent on them with
interest at official interest rates, I would have no regrets excepting for that small number
who ar~ really outstanding and that number you can on your fingertips. Out 0 f 30,000
Indian scientists in the United §tates, there would be 30 who are really occupying top
positions. Those 30, I would like to qet back.
C - Would jou say t~Jlis of those who are selected to qet int.o the lIT's that their comddtment
to Science and Technology is very little ?
B- I'm afraid so.
C - You did your postdoctoral research abroad. Why did you come back. ?
B - I Came back because I just knew that there was no other place that I would like to work in.
C - What do you feel about your visit to lIT • ?
B - Well, I came here because I've never been here before.
One of the great strengths of Institutions outside India is that they have 8 large numpe~ ~f
people who come from outsideto give lectures and they are available to the eaaff and students
for discussions. In fact I was a bit dis_appointed today because, having agreed to come here,
I feel that , as lIT is paying all my expenses very well, you should make fulle.t possible
us~ of me. Now I came here at 10. 30 am. in the morning: I made no other commitments as I
felt I should be commit'be<i to spend all my time at lIT. I Was brought here very formally
and left here till 3'0 clock.
C - And no one came hele ?
B - No. I woulq havj~~o talk to you, talk to your colleagues. talk tothe staff members at
!eastto educate myseld if not anythinq else. This never happens in my lab. It is unimaqinable.
C - Incidentally there is a very well equipped Biomedical labotatory here.
S - Look now, dear, but they never said that I should ever go and kave a look at it.
Fortunately I alwa:s carry some work with me.
~ - Lastly. how would you rate yourself? Do you feel that you have made~ a SUCcess of your life?
B - I've enjoyed it. I don't know whether I've made a success of it. It is not for me to say ••••
C - You should feel whether you've been successful by your standards.
B - 1 •••• 1 •••• don't. think it is fair to ask that question. That must be judged by o'ther
people depending on what their criteria is •
C - Thank you vey much, Dr. Bhargava. We've really enjoyed this chat.
