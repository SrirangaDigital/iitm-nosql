MYSTERY MAN

Dr. M.S.GOPINATHAN
The first rain drop
scattering on the parched earth
its tremor
is
what love is all about.
The impact destroys.
but it is the moment before
that counts.
The partina lips are what matters.
the rest is perhaps incidental.
All right.
Iwill take a couple of soft
female hands
on my descent
down the flights of inferno.
It is written,
this love.
writ large in the genes
in a molecular alphabet,
deeper,
more beautiful
than any poem I could make.
And you. Moses.
you carry these unbreakable commandments
on genetic strands:
"Thou shalt love,
copulate
and die
and the molecules shall remember".
- Dr.M.S.Gopinathan.

If you think you're going to judqe him with
his smile,
You should know you're wrong all the way,
You can't do it.
The way he flashes everyone his grin,
And hid~s consequences of his sin,
No one can do.
The calm in his eyes, shows that he is timid,
But the cunning tinge behind them goes ul,kno'Wn,
The manner he moves, shows that he is honest,
But the wicked moves he schemes
All go down.
All you get to know about him
Is that he's a mystery man;
The 'World knows nothing of him.
His ways and his clan.
The way he begs around for a friend,
Indicates that you have to lend,
For him to own.
To fathom out all his slimy thoughts.
His actions. his manners and his heart,
No one can do.
L.S. Ganesh
