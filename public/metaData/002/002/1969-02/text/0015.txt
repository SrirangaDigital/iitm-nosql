RESEARCH AND DEVELOP"MENT
MechQ1Jical Engi1Jeering Department:
One of the pew machines in the hydrometries laboratory is a programmed universal pedicyc]od!'l' Employmg tandem nUII?erical control units, fully automated jig contour generator,
rev~rslng tes~eract stator. and a rlOg field rated at 2ookw, the apparatus weighs 2:& tons and was
?eslgned entIrely brthe person,nel of the hydrometries laboratory. The power system was
Ins~aIled ,by Besslm~ Ind~stnal Corp. At present, a research team led by Professor Kornie
Scoef~er lS engaged ln findmg out what exactly the corny contraption is supposed to do.
ChemtStry Department:
Scie~t~sts of the radioche~istry s~ction of the chemistry department have come up with
s<?me SUrpTl~lUg res~lts from theIr stu~les of the earthy materials rou~d the campus. Using a.

Electrical E1tgineeriJtg Department ~
Dr: Piddla~ wh? was responsible for setting up the elaborate bioelectronics laboratory in
!he .electncal engl11eermg dep~rtment, has co~ducted some original research on the survival
mdlces of autophagous cells 1n adverse electncal environments. He has obtained remarkable
values of ~urvival indices upto 22.87kV, in dehumidified ambient conditions. Incidentally, he
has .estabhshe.d tha~ these results do not hold for larger mammals, in particular home neanderthalls. Req\.uescat m pace.

CAN THE FIVE IlTs
COME CLOSER?
Two st~dent representatives from each llT
Wel"e invited to meet Dr. Muthana (Deputy
Director,'~ IlT Kanpur) and Mr. Gilbert
Oakley (Leader, Kanpur Indo-American Programme), during the sports meet at Kanpur
last December.
In the process of exchanging news of common interest to the 5 IITs, it was discussed
how they 'could all adopt a common pattern in
their various fields of activities. Though
a number of methogs have been employed
to promote staff-student relationship, (Tutor
system-BMB, Dean of students-DLI, Staff
counsellor-RNP, Nothing in particularMAD,) a representatiV'e from Bombay pointed
out that unless the student could confide in
his staff adviser he would not feel free to discuss his personal problems with him.
At Kanpur, text-books by American authors
are made available at prices within the average studenes capacity.
KIAP Leader Oakley suggested the evolution of an exchange programme covering staff
and students of the 5 UTs which would es~
tablish closer ties between the sister institutes.
