FAIR SICENCE

Call1pastimes, eh ... ?
THE director almost winked. We guys,
we are good sports. We can enjoy a
gag, even if the laugh's on us. So we laughed
heartily.
That was a couple of months back. A week
ago, I walked round to see how the swimming
pool was getting along. The stagnant water
was discouraging. Maybe the little hitch
was being ironed out on the drawing board.
I crawled up the stairs to find out.
I How's your project coming along? '
'What? '
• The swimming pool problem.'
'I don't knew. Guess, the other two
guys are doing something.'
, Any idea llow far they've got? '
'Nope. I think a month's sufficient time
to find out. After all, I just have to cog the
whole report.'
Don't YOll have any solution of your
own? '
• I've never really bothered to think. I
could tell them what's wl'Ong with theirs,
though.'
This bloke, I realized, was no go. He
thrived on the labours of others. I made a
beeline for the chap who was slogging.
<Hi'.
, Cam' astimes, eh ? '
<Yeah.'
, What can I do for Y01.I ? '
'Well . . . I thought we could give the
readers an idea of how the swimming pool
problem was being sorted out.'
, Oh that! Look, I think, that was a dirty
trick they played on us.'
• Obviously. but that gave you an ideal
chance to prove yourself better.'

The Bible
In the beginning ..... .
MILLIONS of minutes ago, the Lord
said, • Let us make the world,' and
IIT came into existence. And the Lord said,
, Let us make the creatures of the world,' and
there came into existt'nce crows, fish, deer
and cows. And at last the Lord said, • Let
us make man,' and the first man stepped in.
And the Lord said, 'Let us make woman:
and the first woman also stepped in. They
were both happy. They had no classes; no
labs. They walked and walked all day long,
and 'when night came Adam slept under a tree
in Sangam, and Eve, under a tree in Madras
Avenue.
And the Lord created a wonderful Garden
of Eden with all kinds of trees, hechesbees,
beeesbees, emmesbees, eeesbees, oyatees and
rivers ,which gave them both food and waterCauveri, Krishna ...... and also mountains
which carried them from place to place. And
at last He created a wonderful tree called the
Knick Knack. And the Lord said, 'You,
Adam, J!,nd you, Eve! Thou art forbidden to
eat the fruit that this tree bears!' But Eve
could not resist the temptation. She plucked
a glistening golden yel low cotelette and took
a bite and tempted Adam alEo to do the same,
They both became wise. They found that
the first thing that they should do was to go in
search of a Mohamed Yunus for they had..
...•.. on (gulp I) They hid themselves under
the Gajendra statue. The Lord asked, 'Why
art thou hiding thyself'l Hast thou eaten the
fruit of the Knick Knack? Cursed be thou
both. Henceforth thou shalt have periodicals,
terminals and finals. Thou shalt rag the
children whom thou bringeth forth into this
world. In profound sorrow thou shalt attend
NCC, eat the worst of the cursed fruit that ye
shall find!'
And only thus did it Come to be that Adam
and Eve became the mortals we are. Thousands of minutes after Adam and Eve came
X and Y. X killed Y. and millions of minutes
later IIT was filled with people.' But there
was only one noble family--Noah, his three
sons and three daughters. The Lord was disappointed with the performance of the people
in the periodicals. So he asked Noah (Siddhu,
perhaps) to build an ark and escape with his
family and a pair of each of the types of
animals of this world. Noah escaped, (Siddhu
is abroad, I heard--aside.) and all the rest
were drowned in a huge ocean of unemployment. Those who had laughed at Noah ,vhen
he started building his ark now repented

, Gab. They have no intention of
implementing anything we propose.'
< But have you suggested anything? '
, It's nothing solid, you know. Just had a
vague idea. Nothing solid really. . . Don't
know whether it'll work. Just an idea ... .
, Ha'\7e you told anyone? '
'Yeah, as a matter of fact, I did. Yes.
The staff member-in charge.
Sort of
mentioned it to him one day. Casually ..
• What did he say?'
'Ah, look here; I don't think there's any
hurry . We can discuss it later.'
, And did you discuss it later?'
, No yar! There's plenty of time.'
The stagnant water stared me in the face.
I went on to the third guy.
, Excuse me . • . .'
A grunt.
.' I'm re~lly sorry to disturb you, but could
I Just ....
It was about five in the evening. And this,
guy was seriously manipulating his slide rule.
Four ~uge volumes were open on his table.
, Sure, sure, what did I get? '
'Look, it's about this project of yours. Do
you have any plan to get over the trouble? •
, Hey, I wanted to ask someone. Where's.
.
the swimming pool, by the way? '
Treachery ! I told him all the same. 'And
you mean to say, you haven't even thought
about it: ? '
'I actually made a deal with the other
guys. I do the tutes and lab records. They
look after the project, YOll know.'
I knew.
Meanwhile, we get reports that some
impatient folks (Hi Jug!) have inaugurated
the pool, in spite of its half finished state.
