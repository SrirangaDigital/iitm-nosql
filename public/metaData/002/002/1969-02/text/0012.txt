Letters to the Editor
KLEINER FEHLER

FROM THREE ALUMNI

Sir,
Romba thanks for calling me Bob Hope
{If the German Evening. ,I would never
have hoped to bob up and reach such heights
of comparison. (Frankly speaking, I can't
stand the fellow. But that's strictly off the
record.)
Still. permit me to point out a slight error
that has krept into page 8 of the November
issue:
Picture 5 is correctly captioned 'Red
Cross " but the text accompanying it-if
text it is-states • Blue Cross for the Woody
Woodcutters '. My objections are (a) to
giving the ever helpful Red Cross the blues,
and (b) to the woodcutters, woody or other, wise. What the picture in question does
show, are six respectable gentlemen in-at
least partly-admittedly somewhat awkward
poses in their laudable attempt to extinguish
one lamp each by means of a piece of cork
dangling from their equally respectable backs,
and a specially trained Red Cross nurse
holding the specially des.igned bum-on-fire
saving device which to our great relief was
not called upon to demonstrate its efficiency.
Yours faithfully,
DR. N. KLEIN

SPORTS DAY
Sir,
The Annual Sports Day is drawing nearNo wonder the IlTian will go to the stadium
only for his tea. Probably, if some modifications and additions are made, the Day wm
be more of a success. The following points
are notE-worthy.
hostel flag: this has been naam~ke-vaaste
so far. If the Gymkhana gives the hostel
flags to the respective sports rep, one does
not have to look at the man holding the
:flag to know one's hostel during the march
past.
,naTck past: the Day can conclude with
the hostels marching in order of point tally_
SCOTe board: a central score board should
be maintained throughout the year, points
being entered against the hostels after each
·event. This would make more clear a hostel's
chances for the Schroeter cup; may be it
would evince some interest in the mugpots
:also.
8'lIents: the lOa m.;200m., 1500 m., relays,
hurdles, etc. should be included in the list of
events for the Day, and other events can be
finished on previous days. It is digusting
to watch items like the • obstacle race'.
Moreover, events for team championship
,ghould be conducted first, then aU of us can,
enjoy staff race, student race, children race
'and X-race with musical chairs thrown in.
As it stands, the serious items are intermingled
with sidie·type~events, and the Sports Day
of the Indian Institute of Teclmology,
Madras, is more of a joke.
Campastimes can help·: only a minority
nere know about • Shroeter '. Campas#mes
could enlighten the rest on what this jazz is
and how the points are scurl"d for the Cup.
A sentence on the fastest IITian will not
be out of place, laugh though we may at
'his timing.
To make the Sports Day have its importance, the participants could take an
,oath administered by the Sports Secretary.
If half of these are implemented, then the
IITian will look forward not to the T tea
but to the D day.
Yours etc.,

Sir,
Mr. Venkateswaran and Mr.
Between
Parameswaran, the entertainment value of
Campastimes has doubled. One is however,
inclined to agree with Mr Parameswaran.
IITians, I mean IIT Mians, are doing well
in the world. As far as I can see, we have
in US the right mixture of seriousness and
humour.

Sir,
I wish to thank the Publication Committee
and the Alumni Association for the promptness
with which I receive my copies of

Campastimes.
• Campas#mes is highly localised! ~. Campastimes can be enjoyed only by a few
huduths ( ? I ) , • The standards are falling.'
I have stopped hearing such remarks only
after I left lIT. I feel it is all humbug.
The gags were localized. Some were tough
to catch on to. But the wonderful languagedifferent styled, each better than the othersimply carried me away. (One article by
Mr. Parameswaran carried me away-away to
my Pocket Oxford J)
Jokes apart, I assure you that Campastim6S
satisfies the tastes of many. I showed one
issue to some of my colleagues here, students
of other IITs and other Engineering colleges
and they all gave me the same verdict-' It is
the best college newspaper I've read' _ They
all think that the crack about people counting
their fingers after shaking hands with
Dr. Wagner is simply great.
Mr. Parameswaran, in the last two issues,
is complaining incessantly about 'lack of
time', 'heavy work load' and so on. I hope
he lands with a job in Bombav, like I have.
'1'he timings are 7-3.0 (a.m.) tO~7-o0 (p.m.)
Often we explain that our poor shows in
sports and games are due to our periodicals,
tutorials and the rest of them. I t must be
understood that the profession which we have
chosen to foHow demands such rigorous
training; in fact it demands more rigorous
training. We must attend to the curriculum
first. A~ for other things, well, we have to
do the best we call under the circumstances.
Yours etc.,

Sir,

I enjoyed reading your last two issues of
Campastimes. I am glad to note that the
standard of the • Cup of Aye Aye Tea' has
been maintained even after Reddy •••.•••
Campastim8 s, however, should exercise more
.caution in involving names in damaging
publications-especially names of
staff
members.
Yours etc.,

CLINICAL
Sir.
I thought only IITians knew about the ins
and outs of our medical and clinical circle.
In a conversation with a VHS surgeon, the
inefficiencies of II T doctors and the deficiencies
of our clinic were revealed to me.
Yours etc.,

The Past,
dug and wound around me :
a happy thought
of transparent pools
abundanc.e and cool.
Water brushing past
and fish feeding from hands.
The Present
I discard as thoughts fill
of past and future:
Starting at nothing
My mind in the happy past
or the dark future
I sit and wait
The future
I shdnk from it
A constant question answered
By Time
hoping it is like the past
but may transform into the
unhappy present
The Afterwards '
of darkness and
Maybe: A total blank.
