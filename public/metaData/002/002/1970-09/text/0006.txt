Help I ThIs bloc!" abo\ e IS ternf) 109 It
heralds a column which • has the dublOll~
dlstmctlon of bem!! d\<- le'lst read column In
thIs magazIne' One cannot hO\HVl'r, to
unprove matters, \\Clte to enltght<.n the
readers with affected seTlousnes~, for serlOIlS

they keep angling tor IS an obJectl\ e cntlclsm
of the agrarian reforms RIght no\\, the
odds agatnst such a treatise bemg [lad arc
o\erwhelmmg, also, '1ny effort to tlcUe the
reader falls flat on Its f'lce an edltornl IS
more sancumol\lous than that The conditions
are too manv, and thL readers dcmandmg
Thus, an attempt at \\ ntmg somethmg
readable and at once wlthm the hmll'lllons 01
the great unwashcd of I1T-M would glVe
pause to many, It gl\es pause to me
Apart from thL people who get Compastlmts
by mall and rave about It, It IS blessed With a
smgularly unsympathetic audience It IS thc
rare and eccentCic IITlan \\110 docs not say,
• Ah, tho'lt lousy rag' Like all other IITlan
mstttutlons. Compast/mes gets abused 10 every
corner of thIS huge morbid-cynical complex
An IlTlan's reasons for such an atutude,
when hsted With the kmd of cymcal passIOn
that will seem strange to outsiders, are nO
doubt outlandIsh, but they do help III
convmcmg any skeptic of thelT good lOtentlons
Some have dubbed It the offiCial mouthpiece
of the EstablIShment, wluch It IS, though
most IITlans SImply are not capable of
holdmg such an oplruon, but theIr opmlo ns
seem to be oriented less by mere medlocnty
of COntent than by that rrrepresslble destre to
reject anythmg one cannot try hiS hand at as
not bemg worth\\hlle

Campastlmes suffers not only from such
ad\erse cntlClsm but also from acute scarcity
of readable matena!
Despite numerous
entreaties from erutors of the past-tn fact,
a good number of the edItorials were full of
them-the average IlTlan has not qUite felt
up to wrltmg for CampasllmtS With so httle
of It written by the general publIc-and so
much by the Board-he feels hopelessly
altenated from the run of thmgs , small wonder
he sees It as a thoroughly bOring object dnlled
out by four depraved men In theIr secret
conclave and he refuses to approve of It
Approval IS perhaps the last thmg thIS
magazme needs from thiS and lot whIch only
knows too well what It docs not relIsh, but
would not supply the matertal and Ideas to
make It truly representative of Its alleged
geruus
The matl from the readers IS awfully self
conscIous People arL always trYing to establtsh through Campast/mes the fact that they
possess better tastes and better mmds than
the rest of the communIty and, not to forget
a palate for better artIcles
ThIS they
accompltsh m an amanng number of ways

S1ckentng as the old monument Itself, urgt. us

Another aspect of campus \tfe whIch has
been buggmg one and all IS the famous
staff-student relatIOnshIp racket Apart from
the generation gap (SIC), mutual antagol\l~m

nde to the hostel, or to attend parties that
are fun, or to be enhghtened on DC load
hne over a cup of tea With so much to
be exchanged and so many nIceties to be
obstrved, It mIght eaSIly pass one's comprehenSIon as to why such' brIlliant' people have
cooled off thelf relationshIp to such an extent
as to warrant all that ballyhoo on stage. It
mIght seem mexpltcable, unreasonable and
qUIte mad to be so unsoclably frtgld-If one
has not encountered them m the classroom,
that IS
The staff eXIst as a prIvIleged class their
rules are mvanably CapriCIOUS, theIr hypocrIsy
ObVIOUS, and thelf practices retarded and
very unbecomtng No one, It seems, has
trIed harder at bcmg a pam III the neck, and
sadly enough, no one has succeeded so
thoroughly The VIew from the other Side
of the fence IS none too encouragmg Admittedly, most staff members, by virtue of their
status and securtty or Just by the gapmg
Irrelevance of the student communtty, have
the decency not to care Other~, even m
the utmost state of euphona, cannot be
expected to say anythmg remotely comphmentary All thIS apathy and antagOl\lsm are
supplemented by the role of one's warden 11\
one's hostel ltfe Our hves would be a
heaven-on-earth, and our wardens a perfectly
lovable breed, If only theIr actIVIties, however
strange, are restncted by a defimng If
unwntten code of conduct In the absence
of thIS one ends up gettmg Just the wrong
thmgs from one's v.arden nghteousness
lflstead of reason, whimSicality mstead of
receptIOn, and, above alt, mdulgence II\stead
of mvolvement
Under such CIrcumstances, .t IS hardly
surpnsmg that people try theIr oWn mIsguIded
antics on the stage as regards thIS problem
Perhaps on realtzlOg what a chunk of campus
hfe we are mlssmg, we might feel mclmed
to change our attitudes
It does not, of course, follow that we
would all undergo tnstant metamorphOSIS
But to be sure. nothmg crude would do
It does not pay to be booflsh among the
bnlltant any more than It pays to be bnlhant
among the bOOrish
The Seventh Meet IS gomg to be oh so
grand, Just like all those grand affaIrs we
speCIalise III staging There would any number
of mess committees, decoratIon CommIttees
and reception committees The campus would
be a-bustle WIth actIvIty One of the mam
objectives of stagtng the Meet would be to
Impress our guest!>, so that we ha\e to moblltze
all forces to aclllcve thIS objective When
the last Meet was held here tn 1964, the
PubliCity Department went to the extent of
putting up posters asktng the general publte
to play gracIOus hosts. If things were that
bad SIX years ago, what can they pOSSIbly
have m store for us ?
