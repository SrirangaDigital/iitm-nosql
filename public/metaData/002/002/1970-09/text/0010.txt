IITian ? ••••• What
IITian?
What I know about the IlTlan IS as much
as I can 1..now abOll.t a blank \""H , a superfiCial 'iurvey would re}C~lll nothlOg, mere

deface the IITJ3n (for one thlOg, I do not
know If he IS passive or Yieldlllg), but whllt
I am trymg to say IS that I !.now very lIttle

of that recluse, who, at least to me, seems
to be as elusive as the spotted deer known

I hear are known to wander about tn the
mner~ost regwns \Vhat does an IITlaD
look like? Is he sober, grave, or of even pace

problems, can hIS one small head carry all
he must know? Does he ever smile? Can
he? Is he self-conscIOus because he has
gamed entrance aFter a selectlon from among
many unfortunates ~ Does a pWI stnke hlffi
as PQSlllvely odious? Is he my? Can he
be engagmg 1 Is humour wJlhm hIS reach 'I
Can he see Ilround him. or dwells he in a
queer world of computers and other contraptIOns which tIck, chck and machmate?
It does appear strange that one hears
numerous descClptwns of the campus, so that
one IS almost acqllllmted With the whole of It
Yet, why IS It that one never encounters an

I The dog j~ man's best fflcnd'
Whoever
said that IS a hnr, a communl~t agent, and
o threat to aU clV1hzed humtm beings Stich
staten-eolS undLrmlfle the foundallons of clvlh.led society and bnng It cra~lllng down In
rUins
I wouldn't be surpnsed If It wall
such a dark he that was the ca\lse of the
decline and fall of the Roman Empire
Let me explam my outburst My nelghbOllr used to k~p cats Not one or two like any
god-fearing Cltu:Cn, but dozens of them,
hundreds of them, tramloads of them The
meowmg and cnter-wauhng of thIS army
of cats kept me awake all nIght Every
morning I was greeted by the SIght of hlllf
a donn fehnes slttmg on thc compound wall
and sneering It me In partlcular, one fchne
of doubtful pedigree never faded to arouse my
wrath HaVing to face Its IdIOtiC grm after a
sleeples." nl~ht was mOTe than any martyr
should be coilled UP()Il to bear I am sure that
had any other person been put In my pOSition,
he would have bought htmself II machIne gun
oind a few hand gremdes and proceeded to clear
the VICinity of cats Smct- I had more patience than most men, and al~o a mortal fear of
firearms, I contented myself With decldlng to
procure a dog 3S soon 3S pOSSible
A friend of mine had been desperately
trymg to palm off a dog on anyone who came
near }um for the past week • Aha I' thought
I, • thiS IS a godsend' and straIghtaway set off
to coUeet the dog My fflend seemed to
be glad to get rid of the dog whIch he called
Butch Bilten was a large, feroctous loo\ung
mutt, arrested some",here between alsatian,
mastiff and potnter He had an awful temper
and the fil'St thing he dld on seemg me was to
blte me In the calf As I painfully hmped
home, draggmg Dutch along on a leash, I
thought, '0 frabJous day, cal100h ca11ay I
Those cats are In for a surprtse and nothIng
can save them'
My war on the cats was well planned I dId
not Immediately loosen Butch on the enemy
I was too canny for that I locked up Butch In
the basement and starved hIm until he was
ragtng mad On the third day I dragged hIm
splttlng and snarlmg, Into the garden and
let hun loose
Then I retired to the patIo
and awaited developments
On bemg freed, ~\ltch raClld round the
garden tWlce He came to a stop opposIte
the felme of the ldlotlc gnn A lot of me~
wmg and barkmg ensued after whIch both
Butch and the cat dIsappeared OVer the wall
I crept up to the garden wall and peeped
over I Joyfully antiCipated the scenes of
havoc and mayhem that would greet my eyes
as Butch. ch.ewed up the cats I had one look
and fell over backwards In horror
The
scene that met my eyes was enough to shake
my bah III the AlmIghty Butch and the cat
Were peacefully shartng the cat's saucer of
milk
Ever sinCe that day of horror, I have been
a diSillUSioned man I have shifted from my
old reSIdence and now ltve III a block of fiats.
My neighbour keeps white mIce and the
entters keep gettmg mto bed lVlth me
Commg tl} tnm.k of 1t, a fnend of mme has
been waJltmg to get rJd of a cat ••

THE DAY EVERYTHING WENT
WRONG
Therc ate days lind days III our lives There
are some dayS when one IS c)(tra ordInarily
lucky, and some whl.n Lady Lm.k casts an Indtff... r~nt '-ye towards one ThIs day was one
of the latter type for me
1 awoke at the sound of my alarm whlch
sounded II fcw mlIiute8 before school Incldcnta!Jy, I was III school then As people
usually do when thLy wake up latc, I had a
hurned wash and tn the bargam JOIned the
ranks of those few humans who have brushed
theIr teeth With shavmg cream (my pater's,
not mme) 1 daft-say I enjoyed more the
taste of ' Lux' soap which had on a prevlouli
occasion found lIS way Into my mou.th
I was III no mood for brt-akfast, not WIth
the ta...te of shavmg cream stlU llngcrlng In
my mouth Grabblllg my bag, I rail down
the shlcS No, I didn't go for a toss as you
probably expect we to have done, but mstead,
reached the bus stop Just In time to see my
bus leave
frustrated and desperate, I stood there
shouting myself hoarse at pas~lng taXIS, but as
It always happens. aU of them wert- occupied
Fmally I did get to school and got ticked off
for arrIving late Half of the first pellod
passed uneventfully and 1 had gotten ~rounQ
to thmkmg I had shaken off my bad luck
when suddenly through the courtesies of an
overactive classmate I recelved a promment
lI\k-spot upon my person
I wasn't one to take such dungs sItting
down and I had Just turned back to retall.ate
against the actIOn when I became COnsCIOUS of
the master's mdlgnant glare at me
Consequently my friends found me at the
end of the lunch IIltervaJ, wrItmg for the
three hundred and nmety SIXth tlme, • I must
learn to behave In class' I was mentally
castmg aspersions upon the Immediate ancestry of the perpetrator of thIS Vile deed,
who had landed me In that soup, when the
same bltghter turned up and gave me the
heartenmg .news that I had falled In my
monthly mathematIcs test
ThIS news was gwen to me flav{)ured With
some sarcastic comments from that blot on
the escutcheon, and here even I, a normally
self-controlled youth, blew up I socked
hun one m the solar plexus and he deftly
proceeded to prove Newton's Trurd Law. A
mlld scuffle ensued and after a wlule a
stolid figure emerged VlctQrlOUS, It wasn't
me In my momentary fit o.f [age I had
overlooked the sIZe and the lIIunense fighttng
potential of my opponent
By and by, a second figure emerged, not
hurt much physlcaIly, except for one throbbmg eye changmg colour to dark purplc
It wasn't the brUIses that hurt so much as
the humlhatlon I had suffered; my dIgnity
had been lowered In the eyes of the youngsters who had watched our fight WIth great
enthusiasm •
The remalntng part of th.e day was spent
10 broodmg over my misfortunes and In
trymg to solve one embarrassmg problem.
Dunng my unfortunate enccunter I had
acqUIred a large tear 10 my trousers at a very
vltal spot
The evemng was the chmax of my eventful day Whde boardmg the bus I tnpped
over an untied sh.<leiace and feU fia\: 11\ '0
puddle of water, at the same time exposlllg
the tear m my trousers whIch I had managed
to conceal till then
ThiS was the hmlt I was utterly fed up
of lIfe, I even conSidered gOing Into troglodyte eXistence, like Henry James Thoreau.
to escape the mIseries and troubles of the
surface world At SIX-thIrty that day I
hmped home, wounded m mmd and 11mb,
like a battered ship returnmg to Its port
It certamly was a day of mishap and mISfortunes galore
