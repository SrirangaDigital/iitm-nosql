Sbrl Jerome Victor PaIs

On a summer night In mid-May, an old
profes'lor and IllS leHow-consplrators were
havlOg a fabulous re-unlon danner 10 theIr
favourite lude out, Taramam House I know
thiS IS hardly the way to start an interVIew,
but then, you cannot call hIm ex-DIrector
and leave It at that-not when he IS none
other than Prof Dlbuthlbushan Sengupto.
As It happened, \\e gents from the rag (and a
lady too J) who were still hanglOg around
hounded him on that fateful summer flight
and got hIm down for an lIltervlCW What
we had m mmd was not an mtervlew but,
strange as It may seem, an mformal <;l\lt chat,
we (.ould for once dl'pense With the paraphernalia and forget entirely about wh1ppmg
up questions one after another
No sooner did the mformal chit-chat get
under way than \\e started dlscussmg one of
the professor's favounte sports-}nstltutebUlldang To say that he spoke wuh the
fondness of an Incubator Will be underst'\ung
the "hole affair, and to stram the metaphor,
we felt him exuding warmth We ,\ ere really
amazed by" hat It takes to bulld a supertechnologIcal mstltutlon out of a Jungle and
by \\hat tt 1J.ould take to CIVlh7e the natives
He confessed he was very sentimental by
nature, and has frequently kit nostalgiC about
thIS Inslltute-especlally on those qUiet, foggy
mormngs beSide the Hooghly It was a
wrench leavmg thiS place Just as It was nearIng completion
He proved that he was much younger than
hiS years-by lingering on a posltn'ely adolescent tOPI(., the Ladles hostel If there was
one thing he mIssed more than occupymg tbe
Admtn Block or wadlllg In the sWlmmmg
pool, It was rehevmg the famous institutIon
of the aforementioned name 'Sarayu (tsk,
tsk), he mused ' I thought Roop Naratn or
Narayanamurthy would have been better
names, for a girls' hostel, vou see' None of
us were from the Department of Mech
Engmeenng and, belteve me. we had a tough
time convlOcang rum that we would be better
off saymg Sarayu m Our sleep.
And woe betide us, If hiS mfatuatlon stopped
there! He nad plans to make It a verttable
paradise on earth a mce cosy Island beSide
the hostel and a bndge, to be wangled from
Papa Verghese, .... hlch would give It that
Venetian look He \\ould, lOdeed, after all,
he I~ hkely to be there mote often than all of
U8 put together
Fmally, \\e got him to say somethmg about
that bramchlld of hIS, the Penodtcal System
The system, he contended, was there tn the
first place to nelp the students, and not to
scare them out of their WIts The success of
the system depends, to a large extent on the
attttude of the staff, eager-beavers (and Lord
knows there zr(. many) only cause the students
much heartache by bemg too grade-conscIOus
It has only met With partial success here, and
It could have been worse.
At thIS stage someone alhng from mumps
dropped 10 to meet the professor And as we
were d,vlllg for the neartst unpolluted corner,
he dre" us back With a redssurlllg smile and
badt. us farewdl-\\1th that promIse "hlch
most marned men nWlr seem to evade to
brmg the old mlssus round the neM time
