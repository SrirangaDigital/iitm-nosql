It's the old, old story abollt lab reports
Dr G called us up on the first day
• Yes, gentlemen Any suggestions for IInprovmg lab ~ ,
, Need we wTlte such long reports l'
, Must we have exams m It l'
• How about detailed mstructlons for experiments for wluch theory hasn't been
Covcl't-d l'
, Easy One at a tlme please Exams ?
We don't have a chOice Just accept them
as d necessary eVil Instructions? Now, we
don't Intend to spoon-feed you Anyway,
for thiS set of experiments, the theory has
been covered That answers another question
What else?'
'The lab reports, SU'.'
• Dh, yes. The lab reports What do YOIl
quggest? '
• We be allowed to WtJte short reports.'
No onc's asked you to wrIte long ones '
• But Sir, In the past we've fOWld Ii definite
correlation between the volume of the report'l
and th. grades '
Not really
Most undoubtedly, SIr'
AU nght In future, you can slup the
lengthy blah-blah, and stick to bare essentials'
• Yes Str
That day \h: tromped happuy do\\n to the
hostel There was one less eVIl to dread
dunng the year Came the end of the neAt
class We went up to our tutor
Can We go, Str:>'
, Have you fiOJshed the experJment ? '
'Yes, SU'!
'Get R, draw a graph With x on thiS IlX.IS
and R on y-axis Get the mlntmum pomt,
and from that calculate the area' An Impatient nod
• An) doubts?'
• No, Sir And Slf, It's enough If we do
the calculations and present the results,
Isn't It?'
• Yes, yes And you can WrIte one or rno
Itnes Like I ha\-e Just given the formula
for Bond's Law You can state It You
expand that a httle Yes, yes You can
wrlte one or two pages like that'
Probably, we can
That's Immaterial
What s relevant IS the fact that good Ideas
<he ou.t so easlly tn thIS place Some bod)
should have gJven the lecturers a cour,;e on
, The Purpose of EducatIon' Or at least told
them that transfernng five pages of a text
book on to lab sheets does not constltute
learrung

GAMES
IITIANS PLAY
(With apologies to Dr Eric Berne)
At the very outset, a small clarlficatlon
thIS IS not, as the reader IS apt to InIJgme,
a thlSlS on knockmg a few bal1~ around or
runnmg 100 metres m ten acconds flat The
abo\c come under the category of gameh
(small g--synonym sport). The games whu:h
thl~ 1rtlcle deals WIth are qUIte dllfaent In
that they are word-Gameq plaYLd by smart
plople A Game IS not a game and vICe
\ eesa (Hoo hah I) Accordmg to someblldy'q
defimtlon (or was It the othcrs'~) • A Gotm"
LOnsistS In the adoptlllg of strategIes when
taccd WIth options' ThIS IS sociological psychology and, that's [lght, feal deep stuff
Sll If you're burnt now's the time to qUIt
Actually thiS whole arttcle's a bIg Game
'Vc're playing C An11yse me' :md you're It
Let's begin WIth your entry mto the
IJlstltutc You tome In thinking you own
It and thl. rest of tht world too Almost
unmedlately, you start companng your cla~­
mates WIth yourself and ratmg them accordIngly So one of the first Games you play
here 15

, VVhat's your rank? '

There are two pOSSIble Ol1tcomes to thUl
one. Either hIS rank IS lower than yours
In whIch case you WlIl or vIce versa In which
case you lose A real dangerous Game to
play unless, of course, you stood first and
hence a sure WUlIler
A few weeks later thiS Game becomes
pretty stale, so you SWitch on to II few
vanatlons on the same theme
Q.

What's your branch?

And so as the first year passes on At
the end of It you still hke to thlllk you're
the greatest brain to hIt lIT smce USS
But you're not so sure
Enter second year

ISeplember J 970
You comt back frOOl the hols affl.Cllng
that "dl-worn HTldll look wlnclt IS especially
for the freshers' benefit If they know that
you are a second year they probably won't
look at you The tlme IS now ripe for another Game
• You guys are damn lucky getting a\1
thiS protection from the wardt,lls When I
was 11\ fir.t yLur we couldn't Stcp out of thL
hostel wlthotl! gettmg caught You call
thiS raggmg? Hahl' A pretty long-wmded
Game but It produces the desm.d effect
ThIrd yenr
You are finally accepted .IS d full-fledged
member of the InstltIJte, but people arc apt
to forget unless you keep remmdmg them
Useful Games
, ThiS bloody mess food IS all (obscenity)
We'd better take charge of the stores, or
they're gonna rob It bhnd •
• Look at all the~e second years walkmg
about as If they own{,d the hostel What
they need 18 somt, long·overdue raggmg, the
young upstarts W,ll[ tench them, for
good'
Fourth year
You're a pretty well-known guy In the
Institute by now and you start gettmg thIS
funny feeltng that the Institute needs c1eanmg
up It Isn't belOg run the way you thmk It
should be So YOII cnter politics, and what'-Vcr one mIght say about InstItute politiCS, It
does brlllg out the wor.. t In the Players.
Second Year
Who was the Lit Sec last

good Job of It last year,

Yeah, you. bet 1 I mean, what I
mean IS, that's 1vilat the general opmlon

Final year
The Fmal Yearlil are thesclf-apPolnted lords
Qf the Campus After all, the poor dears
have survived four years In thIS JOint Flllal
year Games are all based on the ImpressIon
they want to convty that the) are already
promment members of SocIety outsIde
Actu.ally, speakmg from experIence, most of
them are scared suff of the future and what It
mIght brtng.
