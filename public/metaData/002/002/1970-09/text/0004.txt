The long, long \'3cauon 18 O\er
those
wonderful somnolent days, v.hen all the world
seeIDl> soothed mto a trance by shnlhng
CJcadas, and the occasional, sleepily cawmg
cro\\ Those days are done. Or rather, to
be more precIse, for It IS much the same
reason ShU, It 15 our freedom to enJoy them
that has been curtailed now The rat-race 15
on agam, and the dull rouUne of lectures,
laboratorles, and penodlca1s has begun once
more
Consldermg how precIOus the holtda)s are,
It IS rather sad the way we squander them
We begm them With a sensIble-enough
programme m our mmds thIS much time for
the necessary readmg of books pertamJng
to
our professlOn, trus much for the
equally necessary, but far more pleasurable
dCtl\lty of general readmg, thIS much agam
for vanous other self-unprovmg pastnnes, a
good part for lazIng WIth famIly, and such
friends as are m the locahty, and bnngmg
up-to-date our correspondence With those who
are far removed, and the remnant for sheer
luxury of dozmg, or of sittIng Idle, cnJoymg
the qUiet contentment that comes from the
knowledge of being free, WIth no schedules
to be met nothmg to be done
It IS a good programme, except that It
ne\er gets carned out. A couple of murder
mystenes get read, the lookmg mto allythmg
more "orthwlule, and at a Iugher level, costs
much more effort lhan we had thought It
would, and 15 abandoned soon after the start
~()t a smgle letter gets written, we sleep far
more than we should, and spend far mOre umc
than we ought 1U mindless entertainment the
mOl les and the rest of It Everythmg worthwillk that we had planned to do gets
postponed to tomorrow, and tomorrow and
tomorrow
Then, on a sudden, We run
out of tomorro\\ s, and It 15 back to the
acadeIIllc grindstone, WIth nothmg ha\ Ing been
attempted, nothing ha\1Dg been done
With me, at least tillS IS the way It has
been. All I have read ID these \\\0 months
IS ' LIV\.. and let die'
James Bond of course,

and Dot the best even m that rather mindless
serIes All I have done was to gIve a few
lectures, not very good ones eIther, mostly
hastily put together and frequently botched 1n
the dehvery. OtherWIse It has been a successIon of afternoons snored through, and
montmgs and evenmgs tClfled away In
quarrels, conversatlons, dISCUSSIons
The state of the world m general, and the
country In particular, the political cltcuses In
the \ arlOus capItals of the wJ)r1d lfi general,
and ID New DelhI In particular, the latest
popular books, films, and fashIOns, the
successes and fatlures of fnends and acquamtances In theIr various "entures, the prowess
and achIevements of ourselv's and our chlldren, the sms of our neIghbours, one tOpiC
followmg hard on the heels of the other 10 a
delightfully IllogIcal and totally unconnected
sequence, and everythmg talked over WIth
that aIr of serIOusness and mature WIsdom
that we hke to gIve ourselves, whlle uttenng
all those bromides that appeal to the Inmted
intelligence I do not know If all thIS could be
dlgmfied WIth the tItle of conversatIOn and
dlscusslOn However, three months of dOing
nothmg hardly fits one for the rather
strenuouS Job of se.!rchmg for the right word
to use m a given context I, certamly, am not
nOw up to It
So, conversatton, diSCUSSIOn, or what you
wlll, filled an the mornmgs and most of
the evemngs, the rest were spent 111 theatres--we are a mOvIe afflIcted culture, and I as
much so as anyone else Apropos of mOVies,
I wonder why we, movle-.goel~ all, do not
stand together for sdf proteCtion, and IDSlst on
the ou<tmg of advertIsements lfi theatres We
pay, after all, for entertamment-well, Jnyv.ay,
let us call It that WIthout bemg SIdetracked
IDto a diSCUSSIon whether murder, mayhem,
sex and slush can be conSIdered entertamment We pay, aftcr all, to be entertamed, not
to have our mtelbgence Insulted by the very
pOSItive assertlons of the respectlvl manufacturers that Colgate toothpaste helps a
bachelor get martJed, and Improves hu!

busmess prospects, Ne .... Tonos-7 tolUc brings
a very dead corpse back to exuberant bfe In a
flash, Clearasll dears up pimples fast (nothmg
can clear up pImples, one Just has to learn to
love havmg them) SJlvllmn hair tomc grows
haIr even on eggs, and so on, while our nerves
wear thin, and we have to exercise all our
powers of control to keep from gomg berserk
Manufacturers, and theIr advertIsmg fnends
arc, anyway, a htde lo\\cr than the angels
They have the sordid deSIre to dIVert other
people's gold Into theIr pockets WhIch, being
so, It IS to be expected that advertisements
wdl be even at best, wlld exaggeratIOns grown
Everyone
from a small kernel of truth
recogfilzes thiS, and It IS not over the Issue
of untruthfulness that one lS up m arms It
IS Just that one yearns, m a wJ!d and desperate way, for a certam degree of arhstry m
the pre~entatlOn of the Ites
And yet, for all the banahty and the downrIght falsehood, one has to admit the
persuasIVe effect of the hard-sell I use
Colgate toothpaste, have drunk Gold Spot
and Coca-Cola for all my fulmlOatlons agamst
them, have 111 my pre-Charnunar days smoked
SCissors (the cIgarette for men of action I),
and wJ!l, some forty or fifty years hence, no
doubt take to drammg Tonos-7 tomc by
the gallon
There IS a moral somewhere 1fi all thiS But.
after havmg let m)self run to seed, for tlVO
whole months, as I have been III pams to
POlllt out, I am Unable to spot It Let those that
can, find It for themselves. I have ani) thiS left
to say that tillS flimsy .!rtlcle, WrItten at the
tall end of the hohdays, and about the only
thmg even remotely creative to come out of
them, seems hardly Justllicatton enough for two
whole months Hustlers, people who are always
on the go, Will no doubt level the accusatIOn
at mC that men have moved mountalO~ III less
tlffie All the reply I can give I. th.n some
men probably could do thIS and more III t\\O
months, but mice rarely ever, and dormice
not at all
