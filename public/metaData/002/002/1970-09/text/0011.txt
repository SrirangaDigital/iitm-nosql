• No,' I \\ I,h to congratulate .11\ those
ne'l\ graduates who havt. rccel\cd their
degrees todw You Will soon enter upon
)our profes."lOllal hfe In "hlch the knowledge and c'\pcrh,e that ~Oll hoi' e acqUired
at the Institute Ifter )ears of h'lrd pnparalion will be pllt to test Some of you "111,
no doubt, go abroad for hIgher studies but
It IS Ill) hop~ that you "III all come back
some time or other to serve \our country to
the best of ) OUT ablbl) . The basiC p oblems
whIch contront us today are not merely
elemental, h\..e hunger and povert), but
deeply ps,chologlcal They touch upon the
structure and form of our SOCILty and upon
our socIal and etlucal values. The, demand,
III addition to the mastery of SClenlific tools
and techmques, a sure understandmg of oursehes and of the 'l\orld m "hlch we live I
have no doubt that the type of educatIOn
that you have had here has not only made
you professIonally competent as eng meers
but also has equipped you" Ith the moral,
mtellectual and Imagmatne powers that you
need to face life successfully. You represent
the future, yours are the opportUl\iues
yours are the challenges ThiS IS the pnde
and the pnce of tomorrow's leadership. A:;.
you stand upon that threshold of the future,
I bid )-ou "God speed ..

From Here and There
QUIte befittmg our Intellectual atmosphere,
once the IITlans enter the final year of their
course they contemplate gOlllg abroad And
for the maJortty of tht. students thiS means
not a trip to Fxpo '70 but one to Untted
States of Amenca. As the number of students
Involved In thiS effort IS qUite large our
campus Itself has been recogmsed as one
of the centres for wntmg GRE and TOEFL
When you analyse the l>enousness of their
plannmg you find they come under two
categories one group IS keen about higher
educatIOn and Job opportumtles and the other
about collecting the frec hterature made
available by those Amencan UmverslUes
When some of them leave the country, ID the
words of one of our alumm, (IndIa may not
feel the bram "dram" but Amenca certamly
does '
The new year has Just begun and the
cream of lIT has already started baggmg
several trophies and pnzes at vanous contests
held 10 the City But, If one gives a senOUl>
thought he Will realil>e that when a trophy or
prIZe IS won, It has an unpact not only on an
mdlvldual but on the entue student populatIOn

Mter the address was delivered, the Deput\
Director gave a ,ote of thanks and the band
struck up • Jana Gana Mana' The graduate«
departed for the receptIOn at the CLT and
the gathertng dl"persed In peace

ThIS IS not my oplDlon alone Last year
durmg the cultural week, vyhen lIT won the
trophy for qUIz and smce the home team was
not eligible for the same, It was deCided to
pass It on to the second best team. At that
moment, some one from the audience, who
was qUite sympathetic about the Situation,
shouted, 'at least a hohday'
Such a
demand, m general, IS fully justified and 1D
future the rules bmdmg these contests can be
so amended that the City colleges wtll contest
for trophies and the home team for holidays
