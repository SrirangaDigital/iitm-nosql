• What IS the malO duty of the graduates
of our Institutes of Tlchnology? What IS
the return that our country rcalises on the
big Investments It has made for gIVing thL
best pOSSlble sClentrfic and technological
education to Its graduates?

The Pentagon Parade
No report of the Convocation IS complete
v/'lthout a mention of these objects At a
first glance, one makes them out to be rather
lr1:egular, but then, they are decorative.
They come m two shades, Pink and blue,
and are palllted up a few days before the
Com ocatlon When the OAT IS rigged up,
and the pathways swept, one finds them by
the roadSide wearmg that way-out, made-forthe-occasion look. Gone are the days when
flags of all colours used to dot the landscape
by the dozen on such a ceremonious occaSIOn,
and the Engmeenng Urut must be giVen due
aedlt for InnovatUlg an uJUque, ongmal and
unagmatlve way of decoraung OAT Consldenng the number of fonctlons held there, It
IS rather unfair on thelI" part to allow us such
a ViSUal treat only once a year. Too much,
they say, IS cloymg, and our maroon stage IS
a good example The pentagons do look a
SIght better than the rest of the chryanthemum~ and It IS a pIty that everyone takes
them for granted. But to the restheucally.

Dr Mudahar

Here are a few excerpts from the address
• Fonunatel) for us, our war ag81nst
poveny, dirt, disease, and superstition has
cOUlclded WIth what we and our chIldren will
call the Age of SClenc~ For the sensattonal
breakthrough m sCIence and technology that
has occurred In the la~t twenty years or
~o wdl give Its name to an age, to make It,
we hope, more resplendent than the Golden
Ages of Romance and PolitIcal Splendour
If sCience can penetrate the bves of millions
of people who have for centuries stood outSide the halls of splendour WIth the assurance
that theIr wants can be met, theIr mlDds
Illumlllated, their hearts uplifted, we shall
owe SCIence more than we have ever owed
human glory We have m our hands today
the power to make deserts bloom, feed the
hungry, clothe the naked, transport the statiC
-In a word, to push back the boundanes of
dunkmg and hVlOg tIll once agalO In the
story of manlund, young men shall see
VISIons and old men dream dreams
, The Immediate responsIbility for the
awakemng 1<; with ourselves Nothmg except
our own lethargy and Indolence stands betweln the recogrutlon of thiS patent truth
and ItS ImplementatIOn In our dauy lives
Let me say that It IS aXIOmatic In economIc
plannmg for developmg Countnes that sCIence
and technology should play a deCISIve role
In IIlcreasmg agncultural .md mdustnal productiVIty fh,s IS more so, because hme IS
our lnemy We must do In decades what It
has taken centunes to achieve m the de\ e-

1 am told that a Iargl. proponlOn of our
best graduates m engmeerlng and technology
go abroad each year for lugher studle~ and
research and pOSSibly for employment there
I sec no hann m their gomg abrOAd to
advance theIr kno,,"Jedge and to acqUIre new
experience But the Institutes of Technology,
I hope you WIll agree, are not a trammg
ground for the export of our SCIentific talent
to other countries ThL graduates have a
debt to pay to the socIety that has educated
them I expect our graduates to rem811l and
work wlthm thcu country, face the hardships
that the SOCiety to wluch they belong faces
and work for the reconstructIOn of our
economlC life At the same tune, It IS also
the duty of the Go\crnment to see that
a congemal atmosphere, especla\ly In terms
of proper conditions of servIce, IS created
for techmcal per<;onnel to functton creattvt.ly

True, there are greener pastures In more

people for Its de\elopment and expandmg

of TeChnology to aim at hIgh acaderruc excellence, nor for the !otudents of the Institutes
to graduate" Ith high scholastic record~ Both
the Institutes and theIr alumm must become
an mtegral part of the SOCial structure of our
country They must have a commItment to
our socIety In the hoary past, India stood
In the vanguard of learmng and made a nughty
contnbutlOn to mathematics, astronom},
medICine and surgery and other branches of
knowledge Now that we have come IDtO

generatIon to recapture the pnstme glon of
