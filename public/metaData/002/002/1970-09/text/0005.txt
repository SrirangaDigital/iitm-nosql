The door opens. A 0001 looking cat with
a beard nght out of GreenwIch Village
(circa 1960) and the budd of a rugby halfback steps out. Briskly tuttmg short our
half-baked •sorry-we are-late' apologies he
leads us tn, where hiS Frau greets us With a
very Indtan • namaste ' Jens Ulrich DaVids
passes the Cigarettes around, leans back and
says' Let's get down to busllless'
That's the way thmgs are With the Davids
Young snd Just out of UnIVerSIty, they are
burning up With Ideas to change the world,and It Isn't restricted to Ideas alone lIke most
of uS slobs Thay are gettlDg down to work
at It, dOing their thmg at the Humamties
Department of I I. T Madras They JOIned
up only thIs February and now our German
course Isn't what It used to be-thmgs are
happenmg
If that last sentence sounded lIke a
mystenous plot was bemg cooked up, relax I
The DaVIds are about the most frank and
candid people we have met and we went
away WIth the feeling that a few more lIberal
mmds hke theIrs, and we wouldn't have
thmgs hke war, God, marnage, motherhood,
censorship and periodicals We asked them
tons of prying httle questIOns and there were
no evasIOns straight, frank and sometImes
starthng the answers came back as thIck and
fast as the questlomng • Restralllt' doesn't
eXISt In the DaVids dIctIOnary-they spoke
at length on what are normally conSIdered
, touchy' subjects VIZ Hitler, East Germany
and legal pornography
Of course, we asked them standard questlo~nly \ve didn't get the standard rephes
What do they thlllk of lIT boys? Well,
saId Mrs Ingnd DaVids 'Very kllld, very
pohte and VERY LAZY'. In Germany
(where she has teachlllg el(penence) the first
thtng that happened to her was a WIse guy
asklOg • How do you thlllk you are quaIJfied
to teach us?' or I DId YOU take Up teaching
because you couldn't get any other Job?'
And she had to stand up and defend herself

Here on the other hand, every one dutifully
copIes notes She found that a llule dISconcertmg and Dr Jens-Ulrlch nodded, addIng • That's what you guys lack here,
rebellIon' C mon, you 3/5s' We all used
to dream about a pretty German lady taklng
classes for us, and now when you get It you
let us down like this'
What do they thInk of the German
course? 'A load of crap saId', Mr DaVIds.
All you learnt here W<iS, quote, How to say
hello to two gIrls outside a theatre, unquote,
whIch does you about as much good as learnIng a rare SwahilI dialect Thmgs aren't
gOing to be hke that any more (and their eyes
ht up when they said thls)-they are wnttng
a book which IS gomg to enabl a you to read
and understand German technical literature
You may not be able to read Goethe or
whl$per sweet nothings to pretty German
FrauleinS, but when It comes to engmeenng
you are In the • tn crowd'.
He IS a SOCIOlogy maJor, whIle she speClallzed In Laun If you can figure out what
the hell they are domg teachmg German
together In India, come and explalD It
to me sometime, because they don t know
either Any hobbles? Well, readlJlg and
analyzmg India Movlcs? Yes, but they
can't figure out why nude scenes are censored
In India
Do they object to war mOVles at
the OAT? No, but apparently a lot of other
Gcrmans feel strongly about It (Did you,
know that?) Oh yes, Dr DaVids IS a playwrIght too He produced two plays both of
which were, ID hiS own words, awful

Andy Warhol's mO\Jes, underground hterature, religIOn, Hair-you name It, they dIScoursed upon It. One could not but notice
that they were definttely • a.ntl·estabhslunent',
If that clIche could be attnbuted to genuine
rebels
Dr and Mrs DaVids make a round team,
they agree on almost everythlllg and the few
tIInes they don't, they agree to dIsagree We
tned gettmg them to disagree In the • Obedience of a Wife to her husband '-we were
