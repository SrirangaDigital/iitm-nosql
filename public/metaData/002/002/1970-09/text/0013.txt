ThIs, of COUfSL l~ the y-.ar of dlL Meet
And not unnaturally, a great amount of en
thUslasm and hope IS to be ~cen nowaday~ In
the local-usually placId-sports clrclc~ The
Director, for one, has made • \VlnnUlg 1t' the
pt.t theme of hIs s~ches, Prof Gupta and
others (your SCribe Included), ha,e JJteady
begun totmg up pOInts and figurmg out when
d where tht. breaks have got to occur If
:'e are goI~g to win the Eighth Inter lIT
Meet Nonce that nobody, repeat nobody,
t-illts 10 terms of • at least retamlng our second
place'
E\en the pessunlsts are convmced,
that playmg on home grounds and wlth----er,
locai refrees, we can accomphsh at least that

rn~~w a fe" detaIls "hlch, doubtless, the
,.. eU-mformed IITI3n already knows The
meet will be spread over four dayb from the
28th to the 31st of December-a nIce way to
commence the semester, I should thmk
From tlus year, GymnastiCS Will be on an
equal level WJth the other sports, brtngmg
thel! number upto elgbt, besIdes athletics
Teams secuflog the first three places tn each
sport Will be awarded respectively 10, 6, and
2 pOints
The pomts are double for athlehcs
An mterestmg mnovatWIJ lS that frDm thlS
meet onwards each lIT wlll send a Cultural
Team of SIX to partiCIpate mInter-lIT
Debate, QuIZ, and Rnte~alnrnent competl
tlOns Ho"ever, one can t help feelmg that
SIX seems to be a rather Inadequate number
Anyway, a start has been made Oh, and be-fore I forget:--bowmg to the asplrattons of
IndIan Womanhood the IITs have deCIded
that each mstltute • shall send a team of lad)
participants for competltJons to be held ID
table--tenms and badmtnton'
Flex your
muscles, all ye local Romeos, and may there
never be a dull moment
And now to the crux of the matter-what
ar~ our chances 1 All those lD the knnw are
agreed that somethtng like 60 out of a total of
Y80 pOJDts wIll have to be secured If we are
to be Numero Uno WIShful thmlung> Certamly not, as rverybody fight from the Gym
Pres to yours truly IS tlymg to estabhsh
What makes one bopeful, of course, IS last
yea:r's performance-that we, a team wntten
off by 0 ther-s as well as by qUlte a few of our
OWn, should have aChle\ed the unposslble
Though there IS no room for complacency,
we should be able to repeat our VictOries In
tennlS and badmmton, the latter despIte the
absence of Sheopurl
The basketball team IS bubblmg With spmt
and VIctOr} over Loyola 10 the Inter-collegtate
league has made both the coach and captain
Palaru Kumar confident of success tn the
commg meet Freshman Knshnan has established hunself In the team
Despite some mdlfferent performances m
the begUlrung, the football team proved Itself
In th<. match agamst MMC
The formidable
OPPOSitIon \\3S kept at bay tIll thl. last few
mInutes and goalkeeper Bab "as really outstandmg It 15 now upto captaw (Shorty)
NaIf and rus colleagues to make the team as a
whole a little more effiCient and purposeful
Without Gus and Co, the hockey team
does look rather ragged rtght no\\ A new
coach will go a long way towards achlevmg
the necessary Co ordmat/On among the forwards The draw favours us here .;nd dwre
should be no difficulty In gettmg through to
the finals

The table tennIS team has started putttng In
regular practice and Prcm Watsa 19 qUltl. confident that we will certaInly Improve upon last
}car's performance
III lollcybaU we have been drawn agaUlst
Bombay, and the team Will have to work very
hard If wc arc gomg to get anywhere
The athletics team, With N arendra Kumar
as the mamstay, will be the centre of all our
hopes A second place here, With the l'a
pomts It carries, IS very nearly essentIal If we
are to be III the runnmg New talent will
have to be unearthed and moulded A good
coach 1S absolutely essential
The sixty potnts 1 Count WInS In tenma,
badmmton, and basketball, a seCond place In
athlettcs, WIth luck, at least second place m
three out of the other five events ObVIously,
there are other teams who are gomg to be Just
as or even more confident, notably Kharagpur
Anyway we don't need a mtracle--Just plalO
hard wo'rk and a sltce of luck. After all, we
can't let tlus be the winter of our discontent,
can we?

SIT,
Recently I had the opportunity to meet
SOme students from another college 10 the
CIty
They told me they enjoyed readlllg
'Se\fn Years of Campastl1MS' and were
appreciative of the artH;les 10 It In fact,
many outsiders who subscnbe to Campastlmes
have remarked on the keen sense of humour
and versatlilty of Wit that IIT13nS are known
to possess The fact that Campastlmes serves
as a medIum for proJectmg a pleasant lInage of
the lITlaI\ outside thiS msUtute need not
be reiterated
But It IS matters reiatlDg to th~ Cultural
Wed, that stnke a dIScordant note
When It
comes to a debate, a group dISCUSSion, or lust
pure entertamment, the IITlan becomes very
choosy He must have nothing but the best
Anything else deserves to be booed off the
stage. Approach and question hun and you
will fInd that he has genutne grievanCes
The ngour and seventy of the curriculum
demands a great dealoflum When he turns
to the Cultural Week for a refreshmg change
and finds to hIS dIsmay something utterl)
medIOcre, Jus natural tmpulse IS to protest
In disgust But thIS IS where he must exercise
self control or else alIenate outsiders and
engender Ill-feehngs amongst the Sister
colleges partakmg III the events
It 1$ the ablhty to be a little more tolerant,
a httle more understandmg than usual that
set., a man apart from the common riff taff
And we IITlans certamly aTen t made of
ordtnary stuff
Why, then, let the Cultural Week foster
disagreeable feelUlgs between our InstItute and
the rest ?

Su,
Tune .md agam, we arc lact.d With the
questIOn, 'What IS wrong wnh our Gymkhana ?' Before Wl can go Into thIS queatlOn
one mIght eaSIly ask, ' What JS rIght wah It ? •
One does not know what Itq alms are, but ,f
It was :umed to be I representative body of
the students, It has only sucC4..edcd only as
far as the membership IISP"Ct of the constitutIon IS concerned Apart from that It hllS
dont. httk reprCsLntatlon tn the past, and,
unlcs~ certaIn measures arC taken expeditiously, It IS not hkely to be of any hclp to
the students
The Image one gets of the Gymkhana 18
that It IS a body whIch meets once a year to
elect Its office-bearers and then, as far as any
student IS concerned, It 18 as good as bemg
non-exIstent Even the Gymkhana members
seem to b(. superfluous becausc the Secretants tend to form their own c.hque with
their cronlts and they carry out the actIVIties
wlthout consultmg the other member% of the
cOmrntttCL In short, all the cnthuslaSm,
promises d1\d smiles Just curl up and die after
the eleCl/ons ,lind only lethargy and unconcern
prevail ThIS 19 not at all condUCive to the
solVing of our problems The campus 18 not
free irom problems, espeCIally the student
sectiOn We nLed a body to \cnt our gtlevances and thIS can be e"pectcd only of a body
whose members are wholly responSible for
theIr activIties
Apart from functional problems that have
crept In over the years, one can very weU
questton the way InstItute secretanes arC
chosen A Gymkhana representative, thanks
to mdlrect elecltons, represents about a
hundred and odd students III thIS vast
student populace AU tlus must change
Alongside hostel electJons, separate baUot
paper~ should be gIVen for election of seCretanes at the Institute level, so'that representation at the top level can be total ThIS Will
rectIfy the defect III the present system to a
reasonable extent. Another Side-effect wluch
cannot be Ignored It WIll prevent the /adWf
from Sarayu from helpmg to topple the trltu:al
balance, If and when It exuts, at tim,. whIm and
fancy
The Gymkhana must meet every month or
so and the student problems must be taken
up at all levels and discussed. Any resolutions passed at these meetings can be forwarded to the adm1QIstratlon. Only when
such steps are taken, can the Gymkhana be
really called a representative body I smcere1y
hope the present office-bearers WIll effect
these changes at their earlIest convemence and
not, as has been done In the past, postpone
1t to the crop of secretanes Who wul be taklng
over next year
Yours etc"

Sir,

A slight refiectJnn on the mode of selection
of speakers for the Instltutc debatIng team
would reveal certam starthng and revoltmg
facts It IS true that the Literary Comrruttee
does not want any top-notch speakers to be
left out because of freak Judgements.
Shleldmg them from such an eventualtty has
been carned to extremes, In awardIng byes t()
as many as five speakers
That one need not even be a recogrused
II'stltute speaker to get a bye IS eVIdent,
because at }ellSt two of the five (WIth due
regards to thetr ablhty) have not given us
the pleasure of hearmg them as speakers of
thiS Institute even once Or IS It that repre.
sentmg well known city colleges automatically
ensures a place In our Instttute debatmg
team? Perhaps the Literary Committee has
lost faith m ItS own method of selection and
standards But then ho\'\ does one explam
the oml~Slon of John Oomen from the 'bye~
hst'? Is It bf!cause he IS only a fint year
student m the B Tech course and not a post~
graduate or IS 1t becau~ the Literary Com~
mlttee has felt that chronology IS more
Important a CntLflOI\ than abthty ~
By the same standards they could very well
have gl.. en byes to the h\o qUIz partlclpant\>
who I!;lve represented the InstItUte and \Ion
prtZes last year As III luck would have It,
onc of the above participants got elurunated
m the prehmtnary round. ThiS reflects badly
