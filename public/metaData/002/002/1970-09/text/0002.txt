REVELATION
In the btgnuung nothing had a name
Everytfung was pure wonder and mystery
All was pure belllg
I had tned In vam to catch these Spots
That Vlslted the nursery every afternoon
And Jumped from my mother's arms
To tmpnson those danCing colours
And before that I had knelt to the God
Who hung up a malhon hghts for me every
rught
Then when I learned to walk
I ran around
Wrappmg them all m symbols
I bad manufactured
That golden lIght and caressmg warmth
Was called sunhght
Those dots of light became pools
Speedmg awa) from me
With velOCity approaclung
Why do I wnte equations
That have no phYSical plcture
Why do I draw lmes that have no (orm
And forms that have no memory >
For when I dream of quacks and hyper space
And splash With colours and
1 am agam In a wondedand
