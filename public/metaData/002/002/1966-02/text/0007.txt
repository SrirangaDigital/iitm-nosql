P. J. COMPETITION

DEAR AUNT EMMA*
My problem is a rather embarr~ssing beauty
problem. It's driving me crazy. I just have
to get rid of my talking pimple. Trying to
exterminate it, I was startled to hear it
exclaim-' Stop it, you beast! '
My pimple is embarrassingly garrulous.
It is an awful bore of late. Besides, when
people hear my pimple's strange voice, they
shake their heads and mutter, • Poor, crazy
fool'. If I try to expIain about my talking
pimple, they give me a funny look and take
to their heels. This pimple is driving me
mad. Please Oh ! please, help me to get rid
of it.

TIle following entry received the 1St Prize :Member, Publications Committee: The
Editor has hanged himself.
Publis/zer (ill consternation): Have you cut
him down?
lVIember, P.C. : No, he isn't dead 1

Yeah, the Ed. isnt dead yet. Since
the above was copied like all the
others, no prize is being awarded.
Sorry!

Patient: I can't see well.
Psych. : (Flabbergasted) cOI?e! come dear,
think well and answer. Why IS It so?
Patiellt: Cause I can't wear my specs.

Dear Anon,
-Your problem is an interesting onean extreme case of sciataphrenia. Your
subconscious has always been thinking of ways
to stamp out the pimp~e menace to which
you are susceptible. Then realizing that by
harming your pimples, you were harming
yourself, self.pity took over. Being disgusted
with your masochistic streak, you began to
view your pimples with sympathy and finally
became a spokesman for your pimples-hence
the talking pimple.

Dear Aunt Emma,
I am 21 years old and terribly in love with
a young girl of IS. It was love at first sight
and that was the basic mistake. You see, the
first time I met her she was sitting and I had
no idea of her height. Now I am in a fix:
because she is two inches taller than I am. I
want to marry her, but she won't marry me
because I am so short. I fell into love, dear.
aunty, but I can't fall out and so please
help me.
Yours,
SHORT LEGS.

Dear Short Legs,
Your problem is a tricky one, encompas·
sing within it a region of situations that
deals with the heights of human emotions.
I am sorry for you and can only suggest
that you try and forget her as best and as
fast as you can.
AUNT EMMA.

Dear Aunt Emma,
I am a young girl (18). 36-22-36, and with
classic Grecian features and am 5'4-" tall.
My problem is that I have got small
moustaches on my upper lip which don't
respond to any treatment. No boy will
speak to me; or even give a third glance.
Boo-hoo. please help me.
Yours,
MOUSTACHIO.

P.S.

I live at home.

Dear Moustachio,
I am much interested by this problem of
yours and can assure you all is not lost yet.
Faith and prayer will certainly yield results,
because I think even God will get tired of
receiving pleas from a moustached young
l,ady.
Have faith.

C John,' said the layman to the ,jndustrjalist~
'your company manufactures pistons and
keys. Could I you kindly explain what
they are exactly?' • Very simple,' said
John, • a pision is something which can fit
into something else of the very same shapeonly larger. We produce two types of keys
and two types of pistons-the straight key
and the tapered key; the big piston and the
small piston. ~ A straight key is one which
is not taper~d and a tapered key is not
straight. A small piston is not big and a
big piston is not a small one. Got it ?

Wanna catch a crocodile? All you need is
a boring book (a text boolt. for instance); a
pair of binoculars, a match-box and pincers
(a bit smaller than those you swipe from Physics Lab.) Take all this equipment to the
riverside and read the boring book reclined.
Before long you are snoring. Out comes Mr.
Crocodile opens the boring book curiouslyreads it and, as expected (you started snoring
earlier !) Look at the crocodile through the
wrong side of your binoculars. It appears
very small. Holding the binoculars in one
hand catch it with the pincers and quickly put
it in your match-box and go home whistling!
