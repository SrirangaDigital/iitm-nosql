THE SCHOOL PAPER,. :THEN ...

Myra, did you see this'
paper7! It's a disgrace!

I'm going to report this
to the School Board!!

We were planning to introduce a 4 colour printed COVEL. ~~~
since ours is a hamstring budget [yes, it hurts if we try to
stretch it a bitJ we had to settle for a two colour rotaprinted

We hope that our re ;)ders show more

when it come s
to contributing to campastimes.

devoting one whole page to letters addressed to the editors.
We hope to gpt a free and frank response from you. Members of
the staff are requested to send tnelr suggestions through their
students. \Ve do not wish to detain you any longer. iVe wish
you a happy New Year and pleasant reading.
