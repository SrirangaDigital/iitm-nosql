5rpp~ING

BY THE WOODS ON A 'FROSTY' EVENING

This evening I did race,
On my bike at e breezy pace.
A thorn lying on my path,
Has punctured a tire and earned my wrath.
I began to think it queer,
To stop without a cyc~e shop near.
Between the gate and the hostel zone,
Beyond the reach of even a phone.
I give my head a nerVOU$ shake
And wonder it there has been a mistake.
But the only sounds I can hear,
Are of noisy chain and rusty gear.
The bike is a heavy and cranky affair,
Which makes me sed and I despair.
Ohl I have miles to go for a repair
Ana miles to go for a repair.

LIM E RIC K
One day this iron gave ma a blister
And mischeivously told it, 'Don't look so lonely mister'.

With a naughty wink
Before I could even think
Promptly gave it a sister.
