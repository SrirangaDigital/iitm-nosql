Procedure.

First lounge around the Lab for some time. Then
connect all the wires to make the apparatuB look
Jazzy. Avoid shocks and exploaions. Now look
around. After making sure that all magnetic materials and tutors are far removed from the apparatus,
carefully transfer a few lines from one record to
another. If the lecturer comes too near slip into
the next room and suck a piece of ice from the Calo-

rimeter.

If you feel like it get into a small tiff

with someone. Meanwhile pick the friend who's
going to cough-up for you at the Cinema. Now come
back and resume cogging. Check for the Lecturer
after 5,10,15 and 20 minutes.
