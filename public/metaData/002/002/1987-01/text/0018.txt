At the sight of a Maruti car

my courage

And confronted

rage
to say,
love with a Maruti Girl.

Who is this unfortunate one7

I wondered.

She come sin a red Maruti, I am told
To taste those delicious cakes, yonder.
God destroyed the mould
After she was made, he cried.
Curiosity drove me mad that weekend.

I dashed off after my friend.

That Maruti girl surely must be somethingl

Sridevi and Jayaprada in the choicest of Sarees

A thousand lights exploded in my eyes.

friend hopped like a rabbit after her.

He straightened his hair

And went up to her.
