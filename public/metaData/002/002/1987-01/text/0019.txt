Just then, a Rambo-type figure
Emerged out of the car,
Took her in his arms and led her away.

It was a cruel blow to my friend's ago
I chuckled to myself
She indeed was a goddess
My friend looked shocked
I went up to him and patted his back.
She wasn't that good, not my style~ he said.
~he came like a cool breeze in summer.

Rare yet refreshing
TaKes the heat out of you
And filLS you with warmth allover.
My frie nd has changed a lot since then
He avoids red Marutis and Adayar cakes.

In their drawing rooms
the women burn their bras
Having never heard of Michelangelo
And inside the burning bras
burn the bride s.
I t t ake s several days
of patient queuing for kerosene
at ration shops
B.nd even bribing
to collect enough
to burn
a
dowry-defau~ti

bride.
