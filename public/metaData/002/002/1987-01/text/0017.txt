Not a muscle moved-it was as

though all of
them
had bee n t urn e d Â·to
sto ne by th e Medusa
li ke spell of hi s
frenzy

They watched and wa ited for an end to this
dance that they had no comprehension of
finally at
the peak of
a giant leap.,
the man turned his
dark face
to the fire
And even
J

then" there
was only
the deep
blackness
ofcomplete shadow . No
fea tu re

wasoow
vi sible

And
the watchers
knew that Dea th

had come to them

in the mid st oftheJr
bacchanalia to do
his dance for
the i r pIe a sure

as the fire burst about them all.
