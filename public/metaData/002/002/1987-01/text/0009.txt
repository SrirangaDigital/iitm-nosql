ARE WE AN INDEPENDENT NATION?

by Dr. T.T. Narendran
History says that India became independent on 15th
August j947. Time and again. however, one is forced to doubt
if we are really independent.
Look at today's elite lndian male. Head to foot slavery
to the West can be seen. Starting from hairdressing down to the
pair of shoBs they wear, every bit of them is alien to the soil

they tread.

We don't stop at dxessing our hair the Western way. We
clearly laok down upon the few old-timers who sport a tuft.
We make fun of them, we consider it inferior, Why?
You go to any Office. If you talk in English with a
Convent accent you get better attention. If you speak the native
tongue you end ~p waiting longer. Even amongst the society, in
general, ability to speak good English is always admired, while
total ignorance of one's mother tongue is considered an added
asset. Why?
It doesn't stop with the language. It applies to the
dress as well. Pants, as a rule are respected more th~n
Dhoties - A tucked-in shirt and a tie, still better, - a full
suit never mind the inconvenience due to the tropical weather
you'll get 8 lot of things done quite easily.

And then, of course, your race counts.

A white man is
still considered a celestial being. You should see the speed
with which the notoriously slOw, bureaucratic government servants oblige them. As tourists, again, you'll find the white
man the beneficiary of all courteousness that an Indian can
muster - Unfortunately, international tourists of other racss
are not treated in the same manner.
A few months ago, there were letters to the editor of a
leading ne~spaper complaining about a club/hotel in Bombay
