‘ Allah says, “No More”, Allah says, “ No

” ’, cried out Kharim but relentlessly
the Begum kept on. It was ﬁnally completed,
this task of ﬁlling the box. The donkey
Mashmin led the Begum and her retinue to a
certain spot that his master and he were fond

of.

The servants made the necessary prepa-

rations for the covering of the treasure.

Half

way through the servants who were knaves,

A happy man was Kharim Khan till he

He found the misdeed when he came upon the

What Meena had failed to notice was

the strange metallic gruffness that his voice
carried as he spoke.

Meena lost interest and dropped back into
her pillows. She did not know the meaning
of ‘brutally massacred‘ but guessed that it had
something to do with dying. She wished that
the man who had died with his family had
not been called Sao, for it reminded her of
kind Mr. Sao and his wife and Ling. And

thinking of them her heart was ﬁlled with
pleasurable anticipation. Ling had said they
would return in one week.

It was now more

than one week. Probably they would arrive
to-morrow. . . .
Suddenly the solution to her problem
struck her.
When her parents entered the room, they
found Meena clutching an eyeless dolly and
muttering happily what seemed to be:
‘One black

head

and

one

red.
