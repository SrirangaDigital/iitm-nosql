‘ NA RMADA HOSTEL
TOURNAMENTS ’
Jaideep Singh, our Hostel Secretary, con-

sidering himself to be capable of conducting
a tournament started off with collection of
entries with great enthusiasm, but he heaved
a sigh of relief when it concluded successfully
on Diwali day. Some of the funny incidents
that occurred during the tournament were :
1. Collection of Entry Fees.
2. Seedings at the time of draws.
3. Some participants considering ‘Bye’
to be their opponent, started enquir-

ing about his room number while
others did not know what ‘ walk-over’
was.

of balls and could solve the problem
only with the kind co-operation of
other boys. Iaideep was able to
retain his seedings (I.I.T. No. 3) by
defeating his old rival Batra (I.I.T.
