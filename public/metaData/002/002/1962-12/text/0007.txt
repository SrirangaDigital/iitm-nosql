CAMPASTIMES

December I5th, I962]

THE INNOCENTS
Ling Sao was bewildered. In a matter of
a few days everything around her seemed to
have changed. The tears welled up in her
eyes as she once again recalled Meena’s words.
‘Ling, my mother says I must not play
with you because you are all very cruel

people.

You hurt your friends.’

Meena, had said the words with all the

gravity of a six-year-old and Ling Sao, who
was only a year older, had been stricken with
grief. Now she understood why Balu, Geeta
and other friends had been unkind to her.
Balu had called her rude names, and one day
as she was passing under Geeta’s house someone had spit on her. She guessed that it must
have been Geeta.
Rushing home she had burst into tears on
her Mother’s bosom and had told her everything. Then came a moment when she
thought she would die—~for her mother herself
was weeping uncontrollably. There was such
a look of anguish on her usually sweet face
that Ling wished she had remained silent.
With her arms around her mother’s neck
Ling had gently queried ‘ Why do you cry,
Mama ? What have we done P Why do they
call us all a cruel people?’ Her mother
had explained haltingly, but Ling could understand only a little of it. So Meena’s mother
and Balu’s mother and all of them were angry
because Ling Sao’s ecuntrymen were trying
to take a part of India, and then she thought
of jolly Mrs. Fu Chen, of the obese but cheery
Li Tan and so many other people whom she
had met when she had last gone to China
with her parents. These people were all so
pleasantl Ling was sure that they would
never take other people’s possessions. Of
course, they did not always have enough to
eat.
Ling Sao and her parents had returned to
India after the holiday, for her father was a
business-man in India.

Beset by doubts she

had sometimes asked her parents why they did
not go back to live in their native land of

China (only recently had she found out that
this was their native land and not India).
The answers she received were always vague,

as she replied penitently, ‘ Meena, tell your
mother that I am very sorry and I will never
pull a dog’s tail again as long as I live.’
A cloud had lifted from little Ling’s mind.
It was now clear why everybody had been
unkind to her. She had pulled Ruff’s tail
and Meena’s mother had told everyone about
it. So that Ling was thought to be a mean
cruel little girl. Her immature mind was
satisﬁed with the explanation. She was conﬁ-

dent that she could make up with everyone
inafew days, by being good-mannered and
pleasant.
That night as she slept peacefully there
played about her face a smile of such beautitude that Mr. and Mrs. Sao, entering her
room were quite touched and forgot their own

inﬁinity of troubles.
However Ling’s happiness was short-lived;
a few days later an incident occurred which
was to shatter completely all her illusions

regarding her environment.

She was sitting

in her room trying permutuations and combi-

nations with building blocks when she heard her

left arm.

Spoke there was an air of resignation about
him, of philosophic acceptance of his condi—

tion. He remembered only to well the day
when one of his Indian friends was made the
victim of a misguided burst of anti-Indianism.
The poor man had not been as lucky ! He
had paid with his life, that time.
Ling’s father was quick to notice the anger,
resentment and hatred that showed in his
little daughter’s face. But she was not old
enough to understand his statements even
though they were carefully worded. There
rose in her heart a deep dislike for the people
who had perpetrated the injustice against her
father.

Institution of these traphies has created

a considerable enthusiasm and spirit of
competition. They acted as stimulants
for the Campus activities.
The Institute Gymkhana is happy to
announce the institution of two more

trophies this year—one by Prof. Dr.
N. Klein, Professor of German language
for German Recitation Competition and

one by Shri R. Natarajan, I.A.S., Registrar,
for Quiz Competition.
We will have our Fourth Institute Day

this year in February or March. It is
time that we have many more trephies—

one trophy for each of our sports, lite—

that she and the likes of her stood in much
ridicule.

to make herself as obscure as possible. While

teacher’s wrath.
‘ Children ’ the teacher’s angry voice pealed
out ‘you must not be so naughty. You
must all be good and brave so that when you
grow up you can face the Chinese.’
Poor Ling’s face went ashen pale as, at
these words, everyone turned round and
glared at her. Thankfully the class was soon
over and Ling Sao sobbing silently, went to
her favourite tree and sat down beneath it.
Presently she felt something soft in her
palm and turning around with a tear-laden
face saw Meena, at once smiling and sgd.

‘ Don’t cry, Ling,’ her voice exuded
sympathy. ‘ I know everyone thinks we all
shouldn’t play with you, but I think you are
the nicest person ever and I like your mother
and your father, too.’
‘ Meena, I, too, think you are the nicest

person ever. But why does your Mama
think I am bad P Did I do anything wrong? ’
Meena had already thought out the answer.
‘ That day when you came to our houSe you

pulled Ruff’s tail, remember? Mama was
very angry.’ At these words there Spread
over Ling’s face an expression of such relief
that whatever qualms Meena had over her

bold lie were soon dispelled.
‘ So that was it I ’ Ling thought to herself.
She was hard put to it choking back a sob

‘ Actually my elder brother says we must
not mix with you people.’ This was Sunder

the frank one.
‘ But Why?’

‘ Because many of your people have killed
our people and taken our land. And you
are also Chinese.’
Li felt some of the grief that his sister had
experienced. Being himself a child his next

The institution of a trophy does not cost
much. It may be about Rs. 200. But, it
will considerably enhance the Campus
activities and will add lustre to our next
Institute Day.

donate trophies may please inform the

words came out with spontaneity.

‘ But what did we do 2’ My father is good to
everyone and mother is pained even if an

animal is hurt. And look at my sister. She
wants everyone to be happy.’
‘I know,’ Sunder was trying to plead his
brother’s cause, ‘ but that is what my brother
says and he reads so many big, thick books.
So he must know. But my pop told my
brother that all Chinese were not bad. It
is only because of the government or something that. . . . ’
‘ Government ! ’

‘Yes, that is right. It is because of the
government that many are bad : Many people
in your government are big and strong and they
want to become bigger and stronger. Also
they are very jealous if other countries do
better than theirs. So they want to spoil our
country.’
Li heard this all out in silence and his

young heart wished he could defend his
