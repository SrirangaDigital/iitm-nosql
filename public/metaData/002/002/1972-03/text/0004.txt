Bhatia Writes
The stage has been set for a Carmval on
a massive scale. It has brought abJut involvement from many quaTters and many sectIons
of the campus resIdents. With the preparation
on such a grand fashion and the enterprise
of students as well as the staff m charge It
should be a great sUCCess. MentIOn must
be madeQf Dr Anantraman who mhlS capacity
as Organising Secretary IS domg hiS Job whIch
was not optional though, very "ell mdeed.
On the other fronts actIvity goes on With
students complammg of staff high-handedness,
staff complalrmg of what they think IS
student misbehavIOur, great absenteeism from
lecture classes and students as a wrole
querulously sortmg out mess problems which
include high mess bills and low qUllhty. At
thiS Juncture I must powt out an epIsode
which m my Hew shatters a few well founded
theones of class attendance. A bet was taken
between mo final year students (the sum bemg
Rs. 100, large cnough I) to see If a cbap
could clear the subject (a mathematics course)
WIthout attending a class. WIth one ",eek's
preparation frou: the notes the student who
wrote the exam (be IS not an'S' a"erager
nund you I) cleared the paper expectmg 70 %
m~rks. ThiS goes to show rath~r clearly that
If attendance IS Just necessary to take
down nvtes dictated by the lecturer Ul charge
a student IS mdmed to consider attendance
m class as not absolutely essential for hiS successful academIC pursUIt. The above average
mtelhgence on the part of the students definttely
cootnbutes to thetr attItude. The fault therefore
is not m the students but In the system. The
system does not eAplOlt the students' abilIty
and mtelhgence to the maxunum. So, the attitude of grading on the basiS of attendence "wch
IS present amongst a few faculty members
IS wdeed deplorable. Attendance III lecture
classes IS defuutely not a ('Iltenon for Juclgmg
the student's abulty of bemg fit enough to
pass the course or not.
On the other fronts, non-academic, let us
say, the SItuatiOn IS changmg. The students
Gymkhana office has been recogamzed. I
hope the Gymkhana records, stocks and
functiOnal aspects of thiS orgamsatlon wdl
now be put m such an orderas to cause mmlmum mCODveme.nce to the future officebearers.
The Student Aid Fund, after (.areful reVIew
1 find IS not senmg the purpose It should.
It needs lookmg mto.
The film club old accounts are sealed and
kept aSide. Its accounts are stul an unsolved
mystery and we shall haVe to look Into It.
No news about the sWlmmmg pool eltbel.
Till It IS fimshed and boys can sWim ill It, It IS
better no prognostic predictiOns as to the
date or year of ItS completion Me made. It
helps m a\'Oldmg dlSapPQtntments.
After a complete analYSIS of electIon
systems to the Gymkhana I am com mced
that for theIr own good the elections to the
top student post at least, should be dl!ect.
Two thou;,and IS a small nurn1::er and the
polttlCS everyone dreads IS a myth ",hen
one ('onslders the IlTlan as he IS. The
advantages of dueet elections ne "ery many;
chiefly It IS the emerge'1{e of a true representatIVe whose locus standu cannot be disputed
doubted or mIsinterpreted by both the reluctant
staff and the Ill-motaated students If they be.
I propose totmdertake a statistIcal survey of the
student opinIOn In thIS regard bdore any moVe
is made for, It IS the student body as a Whole
whIch 18 the ultimate chooser.

I WIsh to bring to light certam facts of the
Workshop which need changmg. Our Central
Workshops are very well eqUipped and loaded
With sophlstlcated maclunery but their uuhsatlon IS low. People take coffee and tea-breaks.
(The authorIues have closed the staff canteen
between ten and twelve) I would suggest that
two shifts be run III the Central Work"hop.
It would mdee d be a good Idea to open a
MinI-workshop or a Section of Central Workshop should be open after the scheduled hours
for the benefit of those studellts who want to
do any projects or persue their extra-academic
interest without the loss of cla~s time.

Over the Great Divide
Coming back to the mstltute on a Sunday
night IS bke crossmg the Great DIVide. As
I extrIcate my bIke from the tangle at the cyclestand, I am conSCIOUS of a nameless forebodmg.
Just outside the gate, all IS hfe and laughter.
But tnslde, a small crowd waits for the 8.50

imagtne RUSSian polItIcal pnsoners do for

A few souls are trylllg to convey the ImpreSSIOn
that they aren't actually waltlUg for a hft.
I leave them all to theIr own deVices. A
courteous mclmatIOn of the head IU the
general dlrectlon of the temple, and I am
on my way.
Then for some time, the trip IS uneventful
except for the passmg of a Volkswagen at a

vlew-speed. Then I come to the Staff club
where professors, lecturers and other speCies

too much of a chff whether It's closed or open.

From then on, the ride IS uneventful until
I reach Ga.l. except for passmg Sarayu's lear

Those tuskers would kill a man soon as look

Then the ad block which looks remarkably
pretty at mght for a bUIldmg that, In the

out some grass-which he had handy-and

nothing do mg. The btrds are m thelr nests

What can you say of a post-office (that didn't

And the central school? Havmg said that.
