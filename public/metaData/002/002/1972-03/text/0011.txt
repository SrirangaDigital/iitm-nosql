TRENDS IN INTERNATIONAL TABLE
TENNIS
It was the year 1952 and the hlstonc city
was Bombay The Table Tenms FedcratlOn
of India was conductIng the World Table
Tennis champIOnships for the first time In
India. Th.ere arrived on the stage of World
Table Tenms a qUiet spoken and hardly
notlced short man from the Land of Cherry
Blossoms, Japan. Table Tenms was undergOlllg thL first major revolution. The EnglIsh
player Leach, was top-seeded and was expected
to WIll. But Sato, the Japanese (the man
With the Black Box carried all hIS kit In a
Black Box) had the same Ideas of wmnIng,
It seemed. Though laughed upon lfl the
earlIer stages of the Tournament, he ran
through the whole opposItion IncludIng Leach.
What surprised e"eryone was net hIS shmmg
VictOrIeS, but the highly pecultar and
comical way he played. HIS bat had' sandWich covering' and he held It as one does
whIle writing WIth the pen. He would crouch
at one cotner of the table, and the backhand
was hardly used. Any ball that came to hiS
Side of the table, he would' whack' With the
utmost ferocity and power. There was no
quarter asked and no quarter given.
The Japs had come to stay and dommate
World Table Tenms. Pmg-Pong as It was
called earher had matured lflto 'P:Jwer Table
Tenms'.
The Japs won almost every World Table
TenniS title ull 1959 (ull the advent of the
Chmese). What made them world beaters ~
The techmque of the Japanese has been
backed by a tough tramlng programme. The
gnp IS 'Pen-holder' (It means what It says)
and the other fingers of the hand excludmg
the thumb and forefinger, support the backhand Side of the plank, though the backhand
Side IS hardly used. Thus It allows freedom
of the Wrist, enabltng It to turn through 180Â°.
ThIS enables the player to hit any ball that
does not Come off the table (for example-a
short service) and at the same time the
forearm can be brought m a sharp fifllshmg
stroke. However one must be qUIte
agIle to play the 'Pen-holder' and Will.
The style IS Itself awkward and calIs for
intensIVe training to attam fleXIbility necessarv
for InternatIOnal play.
IntenSive tralnmg ~ That's what an average
Jap-player IS asked to do It IS ~ald (~oml
of our JUfllors were In Nagoya Umverslty for
trammg) that the tralnmg at the UniverSIty and JUfllor level consl<;ts of dally
average running for 4- 5 mIlts, and the
other exercIses (such as freehand). EV<.nmg
sessIon consists of almost non-stop practlCl
from 4.00 p.m. to 9.00 p m. With weight
trammg after that bung optional. ThLY
tun between 10 krns. and 20 kml> too' The

CAMPASTIMES
trammg for Japanese Internationals would be
only tougher and under conditIOns stimulated
to InternatIOnal match play ThIS has enabled
them to WIthstand sevele mental and phYSical
'pressure' and to carry the Japantse tldg
aloft. One of the mo.,t fantastic perf01 mances
seen m recent year~ has been that of semlshake hand grip player-Hasegawa. He IS
Just 5'-2" 01 5'-3", muscular m budd,
world c1htmplOn of 1967. It was the ASian
ChampIOnships m NJgoya and the date 6th
April 1970. Ha~cgJwa was pia, mg all the
mam eVent<;. Men's Smgles, Men's Doubles
and Mixed Doubks He had to play al J the
event>. from the quarterfinal stage rIght
through to finals (mcJudmg) and most of
the matt-hLs he played txtl.nded to four Jnd
five games. But It heemed that he played
better towards the end than m the begmmng
(thL way he beat hIS compatriot Tasaka-Ill
Men's SlIlgles FlYlul., whIch wJS the last match
at 3.00 pm) Superlative
performance
Indecd I I I
The 1959 World ChampIOnships prOVided a
surprIse wmner 1J1 the Men's smgles, a
Chmest-Jung Knotan. In the 19 61 ,63, 65
world champlOnsh.lp~, the Chinese bagged the
most number of World Table TenniS titles
mc1udmg the Men's smgles which was won
by Chuang Tse Tung three tImes III a row.
A creditable feat conSidering that no one
IJ1 recent year., has won the World title more
than Ollce The Chmese had discovered a
w(ak pOint IJ1 the Japantse techmque, I e., the
backhand Thus ImprOVISIng the Japanese
TeclU1lque by attackmg With the backhand
(and equally with forehand) they were always
one stroke ahead of the Japanese. In speed
they could match the Japanese. In the
recent World ChampIOnship m Nagoya (1971)
Itoh-relgnmg champion and top-seed-was
playmg Llchung tn the Japan-Chma tie. It
seems the Chinese would serve on Itoh's
bacb.hand, then a hard push on Itoh's forehand,
followed by a terrific smash (as eaSily done as
said) before the Japanese could regam hiS
poslUon. The scores m favour of the Chmese
agamst Itoh was 21-3, 21-6 The Chmese
have mal>tered the 3-stroke attack (serve,
opponent receives, smash) and succeed 90
out of 100 times whIle Japanese succeed only
60-70 times out of 100 That makes all the
difference In the world.
The Europeans were also trymg hard to
regam their lost glory The 1930'S had seen
champIOns only from European countnessuch as Fred Perrv, Victor Barna, Bohumllvana, Bergmann, Leach, Miss Angelma
Roseman, Zabdos Bellack and others. But
they were days of Pmg-Pong, a game which
was extremely slow and was generallJ conSidered an-after-dmner past-tlI]1e. Now, they
trIed pure attack but badly faIled agamst the
very much faster Japanese. Then they tried
pure defence, and thJt was no better. Only
an all round game could achieve somethmg.
A fast attack and a second line of unpenetrable defence. ThIS was the game of Eberhard
Schoelar, after bemg 2 games down and a tense
Score of 19-al1 In the third With an almost Impenetrable wall of defence and a superb attack
whIch he banked on at crucial stages to force
opponents mto errors, Schoelar had regamed
for the EUropeans some of the prestige. The
Europeans were conductIng a lot a ' research',
too; the Japanese were photographed and
filmed, and they came up With some Interestmg
facts such as-a smash from top Japanese
players touched speeds of more or less 120
Kmph and the opponent had times of as much
as 10-1 sec and sometimes as httle as 'i0 mllesecs. to deCide what stroke to make (one
actually does not' decide' before every stroke
but plays through' reflexes' and followmg a
general lme of strategy deCIded before the
match).
The 'loop SPin' was then put mto play.
It Il> a Spin made by an attackmg player from
near the table or away from It The ball first
rises on bouncmg (on the opponent's Side)
and then dIps down, and as It IS done qUIckly,
the opponent IS unable to gauge the spm,
hence the difficulty In playmg It, let alone
smashmg It. When thIS stroke IS played away
from the table, the ball IS hit high mto the
air, of about 30 ft (or even more say If
one tosses as III badmmton) Hasegawa (the seml~hakLhandgnp Japanese) does thiS when he has
lost ground. He hIts It hIgh IJ1to air and gets
mto posltlOn-a terofic smash from hIS opponent IS seen, only to be counter-smashtd by
Hastgawa, sometimes With hiS backhand from
a dIstance of 20 ft. from the table. What the

11
Europeans have developed now, that really
pays, IS their back hand smashes m additIOn
to the loop drives whIch can sometImes be
used as a second lme of defence. Players
Surbek (Yugoslavm) Korpa (also YugoslaVia)
Alser and Johansson (Sweden)Jony and Klampa
(Hungary) are some of the Europeans who are
makmg the headlines With thiS type of play
After ~o years of sweat, tOIl and ttars, they
havl made It. In the World champIOnships III
Nagoya 1971, S Bengts<;on of SWLden a
10nb-ha!T(~d youth aged 18, won the Men's
Singles Title (He had tramed m Japan for
2 years). The Men's Doubles waf> won by
Tlbol Klampan (aged 19) and Istwan Jonyer
(must be around 22 or 23) of Hungary.
Bengtsson has ~peclall~ed In what the Japanese
call the 'contJlflment of dnvls'-hls backhand
IS an mvaluable and deceptive part of hiS
armoury-hIS forehand IS of InternatIOnal
standards.
A last word on the World championships
Itself. 60 countrIes particIpated (400 players)
and It IS probably the second sport after
OlympICS to have so many countnes and
players partlclpatmg The champIOnships are
tense throughout, and all responSibIlity lies
on the players representmg their countnes
Wlnlllng the International ChampIOnshIps IS a
matter of prestige (as IS any International
champIOnship for that matter) All that talk
of sportsmanshIp and fnendshlp IS hardly seen
dUrIng the match (though exchangmg
souvemr's and the lIke IS still there), which IS
lIterally a war Without arms. 'To WlJ1 and to
wm at any cost' IS the motto (After all the
player who wms IS recoglllsed and not the
player who IS sportsmanlike). However We
IndIans have been bred With sportsmanship
and I suppose we cannot deViate. However
It IS the . Killer mstmct' that WmS International Matches to-day.

THOSE MOVING MOUNTAINS

JAGADEESH.

Rules, they say, are meant to be broken.
One earnestly WIshes thIS were so, at least so
far as the lIT bus service IS concerned. For
the rationale behmd some of the regulations IS
difficult to understand, let alone apprectate.
Let me cite an m"tanCe.
On Sunday January 2, 1972, the eve of
re-openmg day, a few students boarded the
7-35 a.m. bus at Adyar With SUitcases, beddmg
and other baggage. There was not a smgle
person, I repeat, not a smgle person who was
to go to BSB. Yet, when the bus reached
GaJendra Circle the conductor announced,
with all humIlity, sorry, thiS bus goes to
BSB. Of course, there were entreaties,
protests and half-hearted threats from all
around, of not leavmg the bus untll the bus
reached the hostels. But the bus remamed as
lffimoblle as one of those lofty mountam
peaks It IS named after. It IS not a Joke
carrymg a heavy SUitcase, all the way from
GaJendra to say, Jamuna, but there was to be
no alternative.
Yet another case: A bus IS supposed to ply
from Hostels to Gate at 5-10 p.m. Another
one starts, as everyone knows, from BSB at
5-15 p.m. and goes to Adyar. You are prohibited 'by rules' to board thiS bus at the
bus-stop near the In-Gate. You are told to
catch It at the Out-Gate, but, alas, the 5-10
but goes to the In-Gate only. So If you have
some brilliant Idea of catchmg the 5-10 bus
at the hostel, then the 5-15 bus at the In-Gate,
you had better forget It, It Simply Isn't allowed;
no, not even If you pay 10 paIse. To be Impartial, the 5-10 bus does, sometimes, go upto
Adyar, but no one knows on what days. It IS
a well-guarded secret.
A!> matters stand, one l>uspects that bus
ummgs are deCided upon the baSIS of some
rules of thumb, half-proven eVidence of
traffic denSIty and intUItion rather than
sCientific plans though one does not know for
certam. When experts III Operations Research
and other sophisticated tools of deCISion are
available m plenty at the InstItute, there
seems to be no reason why It should be that
way. One hopes that a real practIcal begmnlng IS made somewhere, so why not make a
SCientific study of the transport reqUirements?
Let us have a real solutIOn to the' Transportation problem'.
