March 1972J

CAMPASTIMES
mterest has been eVInced by tts few but
chosen membels. Under the mspmng leadership of Its secretary Ranga, about 15 of Its
members went to PQondI last month-btlung,
hltchtng or pI am hllung. ThiS sort of group
actwlty bhould enhance ltS reputation as a
body whIch really functtons, and should
get more credit for such performance than
one normally cares to glVe.
Whether you are bored With all thiS sales
talk for the outdoor club or not, here IS a P.J.-

• He came in for rIdicule, and got some.'

You can see a small fire near the speedbreaker, by the side of Sarayu, near GaJendra
clrcie. You can see It better at nights when
the North-East wlllds blow colder and you
feel It gnpptng at you, lIke when you walk
out from the CL'f. The Ad. block 1S not
on lire. Why should It be ?
Some peopl~ keep tellmg me that the carmval
which IS gomg to be one hit m the month
of March IS all a part of a cunnmg long-range
plan to enable more IIT's to be set up. I
don't want to belIeve them. They say:
, Th.e carnival IS gomg to be one hit m March.
People Ul the carmval Will make money.
People who make money ill the carmval Will
be lIT people (may thiS be true), and therefore
the Institute as 11 whole makes money. Now
what IS tlus already nch mstltute gomg to do
WIth all thiS neVi-found money r It obVIOusly
does not want to blow It up on the library,
becallse the lIbrary IS stacked With volumes
of stuff other libraries are made of. It does
not want to spend It on unprovmg the busservice, because the bus service IS very
sattsfactory. Yes. It does not want to spend
rt on the SWlmmmg pool because there Isn't
any. It cann.>t waste precious money on
the varIOUS other thmgs because there are
as many re:tsons as there are thmgs-Ha I
but of course, the Natl~nat Defence FWldthat's the best bet. It's got to go to the NDF
hke It goes to the NDF through mess-btlls,
scholarslups, salaries, fashion-shows, movies
and the rest.
••• Someone up ill the Govt. noticed that
the lIT bred the finest donors for the NDF
and so sald- 'we must have more of these
lllstitutes ' . And more lUstltutes were born.

Cultural Week:
We have thiS week every second semester.
ThiS year, It Will be a day longer because
thIS IS' 72. ThiS IS the week when every
fiT &d dulls hlDlSelf up out of the everyday
rot, Cllts classes, sleeps the day, wakes up
fresh for the evemng, when there 15 a lot of
work to be done. He IS the host, and he
doesn't know tt. H.e IS the audience; he IS
the participant-He IS at hiS best. And
when thmgs are as they are, he IS a very
self-confident bemg and does not care a damn
what other people say or thrnk. ThiS 15 a
very rare quality and thiS IS why we need
thts very cultural week every second semester.
The editor says poems are not wanted ill
tlus Issue of Campastunes. Here IS a story.
It IS the story of myself and my love for an
aIr' plane.
The dtanes of my mind
Are blank, for
I thmk of you at mght,
And In the mormngTIll the bastard plane
drones through my dream,
Shatters It,
Leavmg me alive,
And cnpple.
The Outdoor Club :
ThiS club has at last done something to
show that It IS not as dormant as It has bLen
In the past. Somc new eqUlpm(.nt (spoons,
pans and the lIke) has been. procured, renewed

Hot stuff in the Campus :
The Secllflty Officer IS off on the hunt
agam. You can see him on hl<; charger (thanks
Bobo) m the fuUnes~ ot hIS regalta, not excludmg hiS water-pistol, roammg around, followmg £alOt tickings of hundreds of watches
which have been lifted froJU hundreds of
hostels tn and around llT. The last I saw
of lum was when he walked lUto Saraswathi
m alJ hIS splendour, keepmg an .tppomtment
With a bearded guy, a regular bandIt who
goes by the name of Ghatak, makrng sundry
mqumes regardIng the nature of the theft.
I say that the theft was planned out In one
of the shady corners of the Pentagon, the
reasons for which are not yet known. I am
waltrng for ol'pal Anderson Sanderson to
come out and release a few papers or tapes.
I Cannot say anytlung more nght now,
for fear of the CIA which has tracked me
rIght to my room, and .••• aaaagh.

RANDOM REVIEWS

SECURITY SECTION
The Institute Security Sectlon is the
custodian of the enUre campus. In recent
times, one misses the ceremoD1al march of the
elite secun(y guards With a police band in
attendance III the early hours of the mornmg.
Of COurse the dally roll calliS there when one
can witness a stream of persons of varyIng
SIZes and In assorted garments trekkmg to
the AdmmlstratIon BuddIng wherein the
G.H.Q. of the Security Section is located.

As the campus IS very law abiding, the
Secunty staff have to be satisfied With manning the gates and patrollmg the grounds of
the campus to guard against the invaSion of
the legions from the nelghbourmg termones
of Velachen and Taramam. Cycle thefts are
a routme affair and periodically, suspects are
rounded up and ceremonially handed over to
the poltce station III an lnstltute vehicle.
The major duties of COUrse are roundmg up
of trespassers caught collecting the valuable
dned tWlgs and branches lymg around the
campus and othels pollutmg the water
puddles InSIde the campus by washmg clothes.
These prt<;oners, mostly juvemles and females,
are kept In a statc of suspense for a few
hours 10 the closed enclosure opposIte the
SecUrity Office and then carted to the pohce
stallon w)th guards m attendance. As the
lIT IS not 10 a state of war With the nelghbounng terrItOrIes, the Geneva Conv\!ntton
does not apply to these pnsoners.

It IS rumoured that attempts Viere made to
arm the guards With fire-arms, but Slnce presumably many of them did not know one
end of one from the other thiS proposal was
dropped.
Another important duty of the Security
SectIOn IS to hand over to the Deer Sanctuary
the dead and dYIng deer found lymg 10 the
campus and whIch had been dehocrately
wounded and maimed by the gardeners and
malts of the Institute.
The H<..ad of the Security Section is of.
course, always vlgtlant and can. be observed

carrymg out on hiS motor cycle, IOCessant
• boundary rounds' whIch SornLtlmes extends
beyond the campus also. It IS hop, d that
the llT has no ten \\Qrlal ambitions to
extend Its boundanes to other p.HtS of the
metropolis.

INSTITUTE AUTOSHOP
The InstItute A.utoshl p IS 4 l'l\act' where,
uU recently. maX1tT1Um o'pendaure was tncurred and mddinltc tIme tLk n tor n InIn urn
turnout of work In resp~cl 01 1nSlltu1l vehIcles.
Pnvate cars are attel d. d to more expedItIOusly, depLndlng of COUts\: upon the stdtUS of
the staff members concemed and the departments to which they belong pH' rlty naturally
bemg gwen to the Mechantc,.\ Engmeenog
Depaftment. Any sugge<;tll ns 'r t'fforts by
the AdministratiOn to Impn VL tht I fficlency
of the Autoshop were strongly rt's, ntt d and
perhaps con'ldLred as lhlllgs tnfrtngmg
their fundamental nghts. HI wever, after the
recent change III the m InaJ?ement of the
Autoshop the turnout of work III respect of
InstItute vehIcles has ImprovLd conSIderably
and It IS hoped that thIS would continue
Without revertmg to the old set. up.

INSTITUTE HOSPITAL
The Institute Hospital as 11 IS grandly
named, IS open for taking treatment at stm:tly
speCIfied hours on all days VIZ 8 a.m to 12
noon and 4 p.m. to 6 p.m. exc('pt on Sundays
and holidays when It IS open from 8 a.m. to
10 a.m. only. Campus reSidents are not expected to take treatment outside the campus
wlthout the permiSSIon of the Institute
Medical Officers and are also naturally
expected to fall tIl only durtng the hospital
hours. If one IS rash enougn to fall 111 Or
sustam any IllJury after hospltdl hours, he or
she IS not expected to go to the nearest
reSident
MedIcal
Officer for
treatment but only to the' duty M.O: for the
day Irrespective of the seflousness of the
case. The keys of the hospital, for obtamtng
any urgent drugs etc. have of course to be
obtatned from the Lady Medical Officer as.
apparently the other reSIdent M.O. IS not
conSidered senior enough to have custody of
the keys.

It IS mdeed a cred\t to the healthy atmosphere of the campus that there are very
few fatalIties m sp'te of the roedl(:al facilltJes
available to campus reSidents.

INSTITUTE GYMKHANA
The Institute Gymkhana deserves themaximum credit for prOViding students and
staff alike mnumerable opportunities to enJoy
campus hfe wah theIr vaned programmes.
and actiVities. Apart from the liports actiVIties In whIch the students In general eVInce
extreme Interest, the Gymkhana extends ItS.
aCtiVities to many other fields 311d plays a
very Important role 11\ moulding the character
of the lIT!3fls who are as a result held In
hIgh esteem everywhere. An IlTlan as a
rule 15 conSidered a person of culture and
refinement embodymg the highest Ideals of
sportsmanship and chlvalry.
The various SecretarIes and student officebearers and parucu'arly the General Secretary
spare no pams and devote conSIderable tIme
and energy In the mtere<;t of the students 11}
particular and the Institute III general The
PreSident of the Gymkhana as the patient
counsellor and gmde \S held m high esteem
by the student community.
The performance of our Institute sportsmen has been very creditable and It was
indeed unfortunate that after the tremendous
efforts taken III preparation for the mter lIT
Sports Meet, the Meet had to be cancelled
on account of the national emergency. Our
Institute had an excellent chance of annexlllg
the trophy thiS year.
