01 Men, Mice and aD Things Nice

PROMETHEUS DISILLUSIONED
It all started one day when a guy came
along and saId, Hey, the people up there
are gomg to hold a :.emmar and thrash out
the problem of grass, L S.D, herom
and us, or more formally, 'Drugs and
Youth '; they are gettlllg three eminent
personahtles-people who know the subject
IIlslde out, and would you hke
to
buy a tIcket? So we, m the first flush of
youthful optimism said yes, put us down
for tickets, I am commg and so IS everybody else. We 71Ud to sort out this hangup, as the cllcheteers put It, lts a burnlOg
question and maybe the elders can say, If
not the last word on the subject, at least a
more balanced and knowledgeable one. Isn't
It wonderful that they are gomg to talk
with us on the same level? We counted the
days, with feverish hands (after all exaggeration, hke an exclamation mark, does attract
attention and does not necessanly Imply
nothmgness) and finally It da\~ned, a beautiful Saturday, and \~e duly turned up m a
Jazzily decorated CLT vergmg Just on the
tenuous border between good and bad taste,
took our places, eyed the foreIgn bIrds
hopefully and settled down dunng the mtroductory speeches, to listen carefully and
expand our mmds.
The first speaker was Dr. Ramamurthy,
and Flow of Information, the essentIal laymg
of the foundation upon which aU rational
thought IS budt, took place It was beautIful
to see all of us, sItting, carefully lIstenmg, If
not to wIsdom, at least to knowledge, plants
soakmg up the ram and uSing It to grow
and branch. IneVItably, we wished WIstfully, that thiS process could take place every
day lfi all the classrooms and wondered why
exactly It didn't The reason can't be lazmess,
at least not wholly, as the unkmd ones there
m big grey ad-blocks throughout the world
would say No, It hes at a much more
fundamental Island 10 the stream of thought;
we were IIstenmg mtently because of two
~me-word reasonS-lOterest and respect, yes,
these are the figurattve feet that keep the door
open: both of them are necessary-It would
slam shut If eIther "ere to be removed
Here, to break the suspense, a few mInute;
after the Emment Neurosurgeon, the sound of
two hundred slams would have quite deafened
any person resonatmg WIth the mmd of
.everyone there Smce we were, all of us,
to put It mildly, verv interested-WItness the
fact that we had paId hard money-countless
CIgarettes, coffees down the psychology-studyCIrcular dram (') It must be the second foot
that had been removed After hIS little pIece
was over, Dr. Ramamurthy Could very well,
echOIng the French Kmg (shades of
crossword puzzles ') have saId' Apres mal Ie

• Drugs and Personahty Change' was the
ThJagaraJan's lecture,
and he started off well enough, descTlbing
the IIJlmedlate effect of mariJuana, L S.D.,
and the phYSIcally addIctive drugs hke herom,
speed etc, on people-the usual stuff, he
sees colours, he gets thIS feeling of euphona
you know, but it was very soon apparent
that It was no longer the dlslOtertstcd
detached man of reason ImpartIng knowledge'
but old Mr. B. I. as hImself; Instead of pure:
Colourlcss ram, we had coloured S-thrown
on our faces-supreme Insult to our brams
to listen to mmdkssness. It was made very
clear that the speaker hated, the mmds,
guts and everythlOg else of all those 'dIrty
promiscuous (hard' C' please) people wh~
take drugs Case hIstOries wue clttd, m

at all to them, or may never have occurred
10 a freer society. DISIllUSIOned, despamn g,
we sank back mto our seats, wearIly recogniZIng thc same old stuff all over agam.
Pamfully, we listened once more to a guy
With mental blmkers on, who hke the captive
eqUIne, looked only In one dIrectIOn and
hated everythmg he didn't see and couldn't
understand. The subject of dIrt, of not
washmg, came up agam and agam, as though
a clVlllsatlO1l based on the constant usage of
soap and water, keepmg Its haH a danng
half-mch long, was the only v,orthwhlle one.
It IS dIfficult to understand how people who
would, prcsumably, encourage people to go
and explore large chunks of territory in
Africa and so on, at very consIderable
danger to ltfe, frown upon and aCllvely try
to dissuade other people from a dIfferent
and as, If not more, worthwhile exploratIon
-one mto a new hfe-style, a hItherto unknown region of conscIOusness and
awareness. It IS very mCorrect to mSlOuate,
as was done, that these people are escapIsts
and by mference, cowards-the amount of
courage needed to make the eXIstential leap
IS Immense-so Immerse that aU of us
here m thIS Engineer-factory lack It and
apprecIating all thIS, to hear the slashmg of
word-knives was awful Soon, worse was
to come-the milItant censor, the Policeman, the great enforcer was yet to speak,
meanwhIle we waited dumbly for this one
to finlsh.
Beginning With sentences mto which hiS
whole outlook on people seemed to be compressed-a chIldIsh expressIOn of pique for
not bemg IOtroduced In suffiCIently eulogIstic
terms, he went on to tell us, about
how he kept drugs and hIppIes under
hIS huge thumb If the previous bit
of Commumcatlon was saddenmg, thiS
was fnghtemng MIlitant actIve hatled agamst
all freshness, WIth the almost pathological
-malIce of the varIOUS IOqulslUons, and worst
of all, the power to find outlet for all these,
crystallIzed In shghtly mOre than one man,
capable of Immense harm to what they label
in theIr mmds by old fashIOned wordsheresy, blasphemy-this IS active totahtarlanIsm Once agam, we iJstened to hipPies and
drugs bemg malIgned out of recognitIOn
and ga,e up all hope of ratIOnal mmd-employ109 diSCUSSIon. ThIS bemg so, It IS not
partIcularly necessary to say that the groupdISCUSSIOns that followed Immedlatelv after
the tea were hardly worth the ume spent
on them. The summmg up was a beautiful
rehash, thanks for IIstcnrng so well Dr. G and
with the usual vote of thanks from young
S. Knshnan, the whole affair merCifully
ended and we were left to carry home the
much bnllsed and battered body of poor
Mary Jane and all her cousins, and be thankful for their reslitence.
Yes, It was a bad scene, almost a totally
bad scene, and the reasons why are not hard to
find. The scene was mIscast; the actors by
theIr profeSSIOns, theIr places In thetr socIety
by all they had learnt all the If lines
were almost III spIte of themselves very
unSUIted to theIr rules-they dIstorted them
out of recogmtlOn, spOIled the very Idea
behmd the affaIr and helped (for thiS
one Could, C(}nclevably, be thankful to theml)
to Create raw material for the Great Change.
Maybe, m the future what the orgam7ers of
these thmgs need IS not a sensItive miCrophone, a lBo-watt amphfier or a Jazzily
decorated CL T but a blas-cum-detector as
Goldstem would say.

Then, maybe these affairs wIll be worth
gomg to.
BOBO.

Now, bemg neIther nIce nor a mouse. I
must add that I don't hke being labelled a rat
either, as IS often done In these columns.
In thiS sylvan wood (alnght, I heard It, the
word IS Sick, but you got to conform) the sexrauo IS somcthmg like 30 I m favour of
them. ThIS thought struck me durmg an
mterruptlon because of rain, durmg the
programme laId on m one of our hostels as
part of CULIF 72 (whatever that was supposed to mean).
I am not a curIOUs person, but beIng a
student of human nature, I was naturally
mterested when the Conversation veered to the
subject of the deer that mhablts that particular hostel. The general oplOlon IS that
It's the legacy of one of the damsels that once
graced the hallowed portals of thiS Institute.
One thmg that beats me IS how one of our
girls (who IS normal cIrcumstances would not
even be capable of fightmg theIr way out of
an omelette) could have managed thIs?
Bemg a logical person, I proceeded to the
next step. How does one of them (I trust
that reader wlil not be confused by the terms
, us' and 'them ') get to the stage where she
becomes a legend and leaves a legacy behmd
(an extremelydtfficult propOSitIOn If you were
to look at It closely).
The day each of them enters this place,
she makes two startling dlSCoVetles. First, she
finds that she IS actually the centre of
attractlon in this lovely male-dominated (if
only In numbers) campus. Secondly, the
ratio being what It is, she realises that she
can dictate terms.
Now, when thiS person happens to be one
of that rather obnOXIOUs group of adolescents
called • freshers' (brtngmg the lower age
limit back would be a step m the right
dlrectlOn, mCldentally) It leads to a pecuhar
kind of SItuation.
It's an unwrItten law of the chase that
your class gets first crack at its own females.
Without gomg further, It may be stated that
thIS law 15 trampled underfoot by some of us,
includmg (I am sorry to say) otherwIse perfectly DIce seniors. When such a chOIce is
offered to anyone of them, the ineVitable
happens. The poor fresher who has been
meanwhile trying desperately to bridge the
communications gap gets 'ditched', to put it
crudely.
ThIS leads to a polarization of the sexes in
the class-room Itself. A glance mto a fresher
class-room WIll prove thIS beyond doubt.
How else can you explam the fact that
three of them regularly squeeze IOtO a deskchaIr combmatlon expliCitly meant for two?
Or perhaps they are stln (perish the thought)
Immature little kids scared of the bIg bad
mod wolves. The reahzauon that she can
dictate terms comes a hule later. It begms
subtly enough, though, hke aslung to be
allowed to bring all her pals (6) to a hostel
Inaugural, the upshot of whIch was that a
mess-bIll dlsaster rehef fund had to he
ImtJated to rescue the poor guy In~olved.
Of course, at a later stage, she can override
the producer, author, dIrector and anyone else
Illvolved 10 the matter of dIalogue and action
III college plays and such-like stuff.
But who IS responSIble for thIS sorry mess?
The blame bes entirely with us-startmg
with the types who would agree (or rather
offer) to rescue magazInes mtact from a hostel
commOn-foam (a deVlhshly tricky and dehute
operation at that) and brmg them to their
common-room so that the poor dears may be
saved the bother of subSCribing for them.
Of course, we must not forget the BIg Men
on Campus who g1ve them that dlStlnctly
undeSirable phenomenon known as a swollen
cranium by the behaVIOur espeCIally durmg
election-time. And that's not aU. Our
secretaries (at least some of them) have
developed a habit of takIng a trIp down to
their hostel every time one of theIr secretaries
absent themselves from counCil meetmgs (for
reasons best known to themselves) to report
to them. Why, gentlemen, why?
Our 'mtellectuals' do their bit, too, by
wntmg about bIrds in pier and such like
thmgs In the rag.
And the remedy to all thiS ~ A httle bit of
the cold shoulder, applIed gently ever so
rarely and carefully would go a long, long
way.
