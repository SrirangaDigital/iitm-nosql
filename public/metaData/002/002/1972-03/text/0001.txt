EDITORIAL
Just Drivel
My last three editorials have been about
rather thought-pro\,okmg subJ ects-<>r some
boring crap If you want It that way. 'What
happens with these trends of thought IS that
they suddenly stop provokmg; It could be
a most frustratmg thmg If you only put yourself
in my place. There you were trymg to reason
out the confusion m the campus; there you
were "ahantly trymg to espouse the cause
of a Greater Law, not based on the ngld
tradltlon of yester·year; there you were (.ondemnmg Nixon and suddenly as If the rramtenance department had deCided to get m"olved With Manust-Lcnmlsm (or for that
matter With a shJrt· CirCUit), all thoughts
stopped prov:>kmg l'nd the least I could get
was 3 mild' Don't you thmk the last hour was
tedious' whICh however was lost on the supposed reUplent, for With the ummg of a Colm
Cowdrey he had slIpped mto greener fodder

the day I stopped pro\'okmg thought I would
end up waking the Jack of Diamonds rr.y ace
of trumps). Well, I gave It up.
Well, almost. I had my Readers' Dlgestremmds me of Ghlsta's qUip about It ' Does
anybody ever read It? I have not fOl two
decades. Only high school drop outs and
seml-i1terates do '. Excellently put Sue
of Body and Muscle (rather H ead of the
D eparnnent of Biomedical Engmeenng) But
you forgot the most pnzed readership of the
Digest-The Ed,tor who can' t pr()'{)oke a $Ingle
thought.

But God IS great; almost as great as a FashIOn
Parade; now, now my dear fnends of the Den,
don't mistake me. I didn't say that God was
as great as a FashIOn Parade; I only saId
almost as great. Well as I said God IS
great and he came to my aId I as the EdItor
of the rag had been fortunate enough to
receIve nwnerous college magazmes from the
Llterate world outSide and what can be
shcker than steahng from them! The first
magazme was ... , well I must be honest;
I will have to tell you the source. It was
from W.C.C. and It called Itself Campus
Leaf. It was typed I Well I deCIded I was
not gomg to be a snob because the value of
the WrItten word IS not m the manner but In
the matter (Neatly put wasn't It ~ ; thIS I WIll
not reveal the source). I ploughed mto the
proof copy-I mean magazme-ftuther and
I read a couple of cracks that made me cry

We have had SOIl'e splendId humOrists in
the past. Shankar could wnte a theSIS on IndIan
mO\'les that could walk mto Punch and make
A.P. Herbert exclaim 'Attaboy '. Well we
do have other hwnonsts also. I remember
an mCldent a frIend of mme lold me sometime
back. He had gone to use the telephone
In the hbralY. It was early December and
black-out was bemg observed He was, I

'Why don't you talk softly? Don't you see
we are observmg a black-out?'
