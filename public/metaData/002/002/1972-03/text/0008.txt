ON HOW TO WRITE
A MODERN ROMANCE
Do you want to write a romance? Follow
my advice and you can hnk your name with
the Cartlands, Blacks and countless other
wnters of romantic fiction
First of all, you must remember that the
hero and the herome have to appear In
Scene I. The hero, (very handsome, of
course) IS tall, with clear-cut features and a
tWinkle m hIS otherWise gray or blue eyes.
H1s mouth may be determmed, scornful or
sardomc, whIchever you fancy.
Now cOlaes the herome. Let her be poor.
She IS petite. Her half must be brown and
curly or black and straIght, preferably the
former. Her compleXIOn IS unspOllt, npe
and peach. Next you must compare her lIps
to eIther a rose bud or cherry (the latter IS
better, consldenng Its novelty). Her nose
must definitely have an ImpIsh, uppish tilt.
Her eyes can be brown or brIght blue • What
about the lashes?' You may ask. Well they
must be straIght and long, you can even
introduce a situation where the hero IS adormg
her long lashes.
It IS usual for the hero and the herOIne to
meet each other III the very first chapter: the
first look IS very Important. Devote, at least, a
page to It. The look must be dIrect, must thrill
her and rouse hIm. He smiles at her scornfully.
She at once ltkes hIm and dislIkes him. 'What
better example of conflIcting emollons can you
find ?' Her heart starts thumpmg loudly and
she is afraid he may hear It. This' heartbeat sequence IS a must for successful
romance "
• Now what's the plot?' you ma~ ask.
Well, the hero and herolOe meet off and on.
They meet at a restaurant. There, 10 the
mIddle of a dunk, the hero stiffens. The
herome's beautiful eyes dart to the door and
she finds with a shock, a beautiful and
expensively (she IS rich, mlOd you) dressed
lady with a cruel glInt In her eyes. She IS
the villallless of our lIttle plot.
Now, all you have to do IS to invent a
past affair between the hero and the \lHamess.
Another pomt-the villamess must have long
painted nalls, WIth say, scarlet naIl-polIsh.
Anyway let us get back to the restaurant
scene. The VIllainess completely Ignores the
herOine and starts gushmg at the hero ThIS
IS enough to arouse SUspICIons 10 the herome's
mmd. Mlsunderstandmgs crop up and the
herome's old boy frIend may aho crop up,
but Just leave him alone.
The hero and the herome stop seemg each
other. She is miserable. He IS mIserable.
She loses weight, colour etc. etc He loses
hiS samty (not exactly, you know). • How do
you clear up thIS foggy air ~ , Here IS the
answer. Now watch, thIS IS the clImax and
a faVOUrite one with authors at that
The hero driVes away somewhere, mduced
by the villainess Do not ask me 'How'?
Cook up somethmg. There IS an aCCident,
you WIll lind thl~ part a tnfle dIfficult to
Write, anyway, WrIte out a gory de,cnptlOn
of the hero's wound~.
The herome hears that the hero has eloped
With the vlliamess. She cnes, sobs and then
sobers
MeanwhIle the doctors at the hospItal are
strugghng to save the hero's hfe. Whatever
be the nature of hIS Injury, let him have •
bandage round hIS head. ThIS IS most
unpresslve.
The hero keeps mumblmg the herome's (not
the vIlJamess') name Lven In hIS UnConscIOus
stupor .md the doctors send for her.
The herollle arrives on the scene all
flustered, thmkmg all the ttme that the hero
could not and did not love her. He IS still
mumbling her name when she goes near the
bed and kneels (that IS the proper posture)
and starts murmuring endearments to hIm.
The hero's troubled brow (plus the bandage)
clears and he opens hIS eyes (all very miraculous ). It 18 like a 80rt of reversed
, Sleeping Beauty' Act.
The next moment the Joyful reconclltatlOn
takes place, rLgardkbs of Ius wound'! or the
,bandage. They confess theIr love for each

other and he pleads • not gUilty'. The
vlIlatness In the meantime suddenly deCIdes
to turn over a new leaf. She confesses her
folly and deCides to become a nUll Or a teacher
or a SOCial worker.
The book ends WIth the hero and herolOe
already planning their little cottage-theIr
family etc.

AN INTERNATIONAL
SCANDAL?
The other day, an agent of the omniSCient
CIA was wdlklng alom, along Deihl Avenue,
when he overheard a convcrsdtlOn. Though
It applared a per It ctly normal conversation,
he perceived bomethlOg Ii,hy and recorded It
for posterity. He was 1I0t very far off the
mark, for every bentence contallled a clue to
the name of a country-well, not aU sentences
but mo'!! of thLm. 1 he CIA has not decoded
It, Can you beat them to It ?
• See that Joner. Is he from the underworld ?'
• Nay, he IS our fflend.'
, He IS not one of us. But anyway, he
doesn't come m our \\-ay.'
• Appears that he's III some agony.'
• Oh, when anghng sometIme back, he Was
stung by a bee. But mark him, he once
fought a hon Ul hiS haunt.'
• He s~ems to be a foreigner. What does
he do III thiS land, ~hme shoes? '
• Well, not exactly. He covers them With
a sort of glossy varllIsh.'
• Is he trom the Silvery land? '
, Strange, many think hIS land is an IlluSion, but It IS real People worked there
WIth enthUSiasm.
Set m the desert,
It now IS a hnd of evergreen trees. Would
you beheve that It abounds 111 a variety of
IndIan IDdngo ~ Look at hlln, he Is so wellfed you would think he always ate as If It
were Christmas.
• Tell me the truth, dId you flee from
there ~ Say you dId'
• Well, you dOIl't need even a passport to
go there; you Just get m a closed carriage
and drive straIght In. In fact Mr. Sen got
mar ned there.'
• That remmds me, did you hear of Sen's
WIfe ~,
• Ya, she IS for women's Lib. So much
so she wouldn't even kISS hIm.'

The Fire-Raisers are Here!
Mr. Biedermann and hiS Wife make a charmmg couple They are rich, so they don't
ltsten But their clly IS gomg up m flames.
Slowly. The flames do not reach Mr. Biedermann; thiS fanta~y IS not part of hiS lne.
Meanwhile, the cY!llcal fireguard of the cIty
looks on, watchful as ever. They always
make the scene too late. They blame It
on the people.
There's Somebody at the Door,
Mr. Biedermann!
Joe Schmitz and WIllIe Elsenring. They
are knowledgeable-for a couple of tramps.
EspecIallyabollt the honourable Mr. Biedermann. They know he IS anxIous to do good
everywhere except III bUSiness, about hIS fine
pettt-bourgeois senslb!lltie'l, not to forget hIS
sense of gudt which earns them theIr passage
mto hiS house. They promptly roll lO petrol
drums and go about their bUSiness In good
earnest. Then they walk all over h,s delIca.te
pettt-bourgeois senslbllIttes Just to put the
fear of God In him, It seems
You've got your back to the Wall,
Mr. Biedermann!
Tut-tut, laments the chief fireman, they've
got the fuse and even the cotton-wool. Dumb
guy, thiS Biedermann. He thmks all he has
to do IS to throw a sumptuous dmner and
they'll be eating OUt of hIS hand. He IS
not even sItek. nut hIS guests continue to
torment hIm. He sees It all now but thmks
he can get away With It by ddlmmg absolute
mnocence. Alas, the company tonight IS particularly rude. BeSIdes, they respect theIr
profeSSIon. Cut out the comedy, they say,
we need a match. A match. He doesn't
understand
Don't give it to them, Mr. Biedermann,
Please!
What a lark I If they nally are fire-raisers,
why would they ask me to gIve them the
matches, for God's sake ~
If the play IS a metaphor, the afterplece
affords us a glImpse lOtO the IdentIty ot the
devil. The Bledermanns end up In hel1 (or
heaven), where they meet the deVIl and
demand restllutlon But the deVil IS off to the
earth to <;et more fires. Well, as long as the
people gIve hIm the matches. Ahandoned tn
thIS strange scenarIO, the Bledermanns are
alone and wondermg If they are saved.
