CAMPASTIMES

.1.2

Thts sort of psychic bid mIght backfire at
times, but WIth a safe haven III spades, no
get'at harm can result. East might double
the psychiC bid, but North can take the
warnmg and put hiS partner back III spades
WIthout a Jump. Or the openmg bidder
might bc obtuse enough to give a double raIse
III Clubs, though thiS IS unlikely, as With a
two-sUltet In clubs and spades, he would have
opened the blddmg With one club rather than
one spade. But DO one would be obtuse
enough to take out four spades lllto five
clubs.
We Should always bid the cards we have,
but bridge would be too mechanical If, once
m a deVlhsh mood, we didn't bid the cards
we don't have.

BRIDGE

ASEMI=PSYCI1IC BID
There IS no fun tn bridge unless you resort
to deception once 111 a while. P~ychlc bIds
are a recognised part 01 the successful player'S
repertory. They must take one's partner, as
much as one's opponents, by surprise. otherwise they wouldn I be ethical. 1 hey must be
rare the too frequent psycher WIll find hImself short of partners. Psychic re~ponses In
the nunor sult~ over major suit openings Will
occaSionally prove very useful. When you
come to thmk, If the mmOr SUItS call be used
for prepared opeiling bids, why shouldn't
they be used for responses? North III thiS
deal was faced with a problem In responding
when hiS partner opened one spade. HIS
hand was too good for two spades, but not
good enough tor three or four. He could
temporize with two diamonds i but If partner's rebid was In hearts and the hand was
ultimately played m spades as It would be.
the actIOn would Invite a club lead, and
that wouldn't be so good for the declarer.
North's holdlllgs in tile red suitS are such
that a lead In these SUits would gam a tempo
for the declarer. So Nortll responded with
two clubs, and thiS had the opposItion off to
a false start.

DOUBLE DOUBLE TOIL AND TROUBLE
A little phdosophy must form part of the
bridge player's equipment. It would help
him to keep hiS head and stay the big
bludgeon when the opponents soar mernly
mto a cheeky, If not downnght crazy, contract. It Will remmd him that the worst
place for a big hand IS between two moderate
hands and opposite a near-Yarborough. Such
hands carry the seeds of their OWn destruction. They look as If they are made for
end-plavs and SUICidal leads. If the West
player III thIS deal had paused for reflection
he would no~ have doubled South's contract
of four hearts. The double in such cases IS a
great service to the declarer. In the absence
of the double the declarer would play the
hand m ordmary fashIOn and go down qUietly.
whereas the double alerts hIm and tipS him
off to the right hne of play.

West who had been baulked of hiS normal
lead by the psychic led a trump. The
declarer took no chances. He played the
ace, and took the heart finesse which lost to
West's Killg. Belatedly West led a club, but
declarer was now able to discard dummy's
club loser on the hearts before playmg a
second round of trumps.

South had a bidding problem on this hand.
HIS t.lke-out of the double of one spade was
excusable conSldenng the vulnerablltty, havmg
taken out the penalty double It would have
been Silly not to bid game.
West led the eIght of diamonds, and the
declarer didn't go Wild With lxcltemlnt when
he saw the dummy-the bidding had promised somethmg better. Thc Jack was
covered and the ace won the trick. PlactDg
all the high cards With West the declarer led
a low heart, and when West played low, he
won WIth the Jack. When the ten dropped
the declarer reahzed the bad dlstnbutlOn of
the SUit. He led as to hiS queen won by
West WIth the ace. West led back a spade.
Tl.ls was won In dummy and a spade was
ruffed. At thiS stage the declarer had a
count of West's holding 1U the major suits.
He led a club .Ind when the ten fell and the
jack stood, the count of West's hand was
complete. Now South cashed the kmg of
diamonds, the ace of clubs, ruffed dummy's
last spade, arrlvmg at thIS positIon:

South led the mne of dlamond3. Whatever
West did now. he could not win more than
two tricks.
If the declarer had played the nine of
trumps after wmning the Jack, he would have
gone down.

Weare sorry, the
issue came late;
but believe us,
we couldn't
help it.
