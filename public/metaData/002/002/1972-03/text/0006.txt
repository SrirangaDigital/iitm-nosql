Nixon's Jungle Law
Scene: Dmner IS over. Everyone has had
his/her fill of tandoori chicken. fish-n-chlps
etc. It IS rammg cats and dogs outside, while
In a common room the folloWIng discussIOn
takes place.
MISs Katty IS the leader of the group. The
other members arc Mr Dogra. Mus FIsher,
Prof. Horace and Mus eellany.
Katty: O.K. folks, lets now discuss NIXon's
foreign policy. I feel. In the lIght of
the recent Indo-Pak war, he has developed
cataract m his eyes.
FIsher. There has been a marked deViation
tn Amenca's foreign pohcy nght from the
day Nixon took over the presidency,
even his mOve to befriend Chma seems

fishy.
Dogra: Isn't It all rather amUSIng that all
along the U.S. and Chma have been
leadIng a cat and dog lIfe and that a
Harvard Professor was sent to bell the
cat?
K. Yes, I too smell a rat and I feel sorry for
PalWotan f>lUCe both Nixon and the
Chmese are makmg a Cat's paw of her.
Horace I wonder why Pakistan doesn't even
have the shghtest horss sense to see
through thiS ,
Cellany' Elementary, my dear Professor,
because It IS a slIly ass'
K: And Just thmk how NIXon tried to project a 'middle of the road' Image before
the war'
C: You mean' cat on the wall' polIcy?
K: No, no, Anderson let that cat out of the
bag; It was never that way for Nixon.
He has always been Anh-Indlan
D: And definitely he was very dogmatIC about
that.
C: In spIte of hIS donkey's years In politics, I
am surpnsed to note that he thought hiS
gun boat diplomacy would nonplus us.
K: It IS easy for us to understand hiS alms VLZ.,
to catsr to hIS pohtlcal ambitIOns and for
such a big mlsfinng he deserves nothmg
but cat calls.
H: It was very foolIsh on the part of Pakistan
too to assume that tricky Dick would
always feed her With arms and to have
lmagmed herself to be a dark horse by
bombardmg our bases at mIdmght.
C: Oh, We paId them back squarely and I
bet It was a wzld goose chase for them.
K: Do you know why NIxon didn't send
more arms ~ • The cat loved fish but she
was loath to wet her feet', that IS why
D: The entire curse for shattermg the economy of Pakls.tan and lettmg her go to
the dogs should fall only on Nlxy's head.
K. Yes, nothmg could be more catastrophical
for PakIstan than bemg CrIppled and
demoralrsed lIke thiS.
D. And I strongly feel that It was our sheer
doggedness th.at won us th.e war 1ll all those
dOff fights.
H: Not only that, they thought theIr Sabres
and Pattons were better than our Gnats
and VIJayanthas. After all why look a
gift horse m the mouth?
C. Leanmg on them damn planes, Bhutto,
the queeT fish, was. taHung about a
thousand year war WIth IndIa and It did
not even last a thousand hours I
D: He might sull talk of a thousand year war
but don't worry, barking dogs seldom bIte.
K: Nixon should be ashamed of hiS VIetnam
poliCies too. After promlSlUg categorICally
to Withdraw all hiS troops, hiS recent
showdown IS to be detested.
F· He had better watch out, he IS fohtng In
troubled waters by escalatmg the bombmg.
C: And what's more, the AmeTlcan army has
prov(.d to be a whIte elephant, so far as
White House IS concerned. The LIOn's
share of tax payer's money IS spent on
destroymg helpless people without any
tangIble mlhtary results
D Y(.s, he IS havmg a dog's day there too.
F The Joke of the year from the Tlmr's
Man of the Year 18 hIS claim thJt he

stopped the Indo-Pak war. What cheekl
He IS fohlng for compliments.
C: It IS very easy 0 see that hiS foreign
pohcles are nothmg but that of the frog
III the well
H. Yes, everywhere he IS mlstakmgsymptoms
for diseases Without bothermg to go deep
Into the causes. Puttmg the cart before
the horse I
K Well frIends, I feel we should wmd up
our attack With the conclu~\()n that If
Nixon feels that he can fiddle around
With other countries' affalrs hoplOg for
horse play, he has got only bats In the
belfry.

THE MONUMENT
S. P. RA.J
It is dark both outSide and mside the room.
The outSide ht by an eene glow from the
neon sIgns of the mam thoroughfare, the
inSide IS dim and gloomy. The damp aIr IS
stIlI and SILent Stranmg the eyes one can
, teel • the vague outlines of a dark man, sitting
on the stool-hIS chill In hIS cupped hands,
hiS elbows restmg on hiS knees. In front of
him IS a large white expanse-somethmg hke a
partItlOn-oh nO-It's a large ("anvas; and
there's a can' of red pamt on hiS lap, the
other cans strewn all over the room. All
one can hear IS the regular breathmg of the
man as If asleep
There he Sits-hiS eyes far away. A visIOnary-what thmgs doe~ he see ~ Can he see
mto the past or IS he pondering over the
present, or mdeed IS he mdulgIng 1U the
fanCies of the future) Is he dreammg i' Ah I
The can on hiS lap, open and unused; he IS
yet to find Ideas Maybe he IS thmkmg of
hIS wasted lIfe, hiS arPbltlons, hiS dreams. The
sprawLmg canvas IS large and empty.
The
'Hf>10naT), SltS there Tummatmg. HIS dishevelled hair, the sunken half-closed eyes, the
sallow cheeks, the pamt and sweat-drenched
clothes, form a shadow of an outlme. What
does he see? MurmUring somethIng to
hImself
• Look gIrl, bnng me my brush' -shatters
the sticnce. But there's no girl there-must
be hiS dream. • Ahh 'he SIghs
Back to hlS uneasy muttermgs j uneasy
dreams Well he's got no VISlCJns now. He
can only thmk of hiS wasted lIfe-wasted
1Ife-wasted hfe-It echoes dully agam and
agaIn-It reverberates-m hiS ht:.ad-It fills
th.e room-oh It fi Is the whoLe world.
He falls mto a trance-a vIsionary? He
can see so many scenes-hIS childhood-the
playthmgs ?-the lone marble whIte red
green, translucent glass-ah I 'the c~loureJ
pebbles he had fondly stored. And yes, of
course, hIS bIrthday shlrt-It had been hiS
father's. all patched UP-It was too long fo):
him-whenever he wore It he didn't need to
wear any pants at all.
And then that day, hIS father, Poppa, he
calILd him, the only friend In the world
IYlIlg there pale, frigid so near, so fdr away--':
h(. h Idn 't known ';"'hat was happening.
Som(.body trymg to comfort him-they had

orclbly snatched him away from hiS Poppa or
had they snatched away Ius Pappa from hlmoh It wasn't clear. Then he had run away
from the neighbours who had tued to care
for hIm. They hadn't been unkmd-but
why, why had he run away-an Impulse-oh
yes It had been an Impulse, yes, yes.
He had been free-free as a-as a larkskimmIng through lIfe carefree, nothIng to
worry-the blrthday shIrt ?----certamly-he
hadn't forgotten to wear It whenhe ran awaynor hIS pants ha I ha I what beauuhll dirty
streets he had roamed domg nothmg all daythree days-but then hunger-ambltlon?to hell With It-hunger-gnawlng hungerbeggmg-' Get out you loafer '-' Work'«No no work here '-abrupt, cruel. Hunger-oh God what a hfe-thrn artIst? Oh
no, not at all, house-pamter,-work, work,
work Tired but work, tired but work, and
then he had become friendly With a commerCIal artIst who taught him somethmg. Soon
he had got disgusted WIth pamtmg posters-he wanted to fulfil an mner urge-to
pamt for a satisfaction. Somehow he had
managed for some time and then one dayone day-why do I have to brIng that -up
agatn-oh I fell In love. She was young and
beautiful, m love With me. I bUIlt a high
wall around us-no one m the world to peek
through-anyway I dIdn't care-what a h~ppy
tIme-In fact I paInted very well then, very
well Indeed-for a full year and a little
more.
Then what happened i' Should I recreate
It? Please, please don't
torment me.
Please. All nght. I'll tell you-she died
And that was that. There she was PALE,
FRIGID, SO NEAR, SO FAR AWAY.
They took her away from me. What now
IS left for me? Life-What IS hfe? What IS
Me? Oh I don't know. Don't bother me.
What;> What did I do? Oh I just whiled
away my time, Just whIled away •.. away ..•
away..
pamt anythmg i' Yes I had to.
Did somethmg or the other. To hell With
lIfe 'SUICIDE', contemplated Nothing
more. Didn't have the' courage '.
Then he had lived a hand-to-mouth hfe
HIS pamtmgs had always been rejected. He
had even tned luring cu<.tomers by offenng
two palntmgs for the pnce of one But
people had ne~er even come near him. If
anyone ever Came to hIm and he made hlS
offer, they only looked through all hIS paIntmgs, looked round the room, sniffed snobbishly, made some cruel remark, and then went
away.
And what next? Ah, the struggle-hunger-hunger-struggle-What struggle '-the
newspaper-Yahva Khan-radlO-strugglemoney-artIst-East Bengal-Bangia Deshno money-starved; starved? yes, 'MIIhons of refugees from Bangia Desh starvIng'
Ohl yebst~rvmg-no food-nothmg-strugg'eBangIa Dt><;h-atrocitles-rape-butchel)Oh \ there he could see soldIers With their rifles
commg towards a vdLagr Some of the
Villagers have fled But some have stayed
They kneel to their Allah, a final prayer
before the slaughter begms. And then the
soldIers arnve. Once agaJll they kneel, and
plead With the leader of the band-a
tough man With an ImpaSSIve face. They
plead WIth him-It IS 10 hiS hands not tn
Allah's that, their hves hOW rest.
He can see them, he can see through their
eyes. He can see their fear Yes, yes, fear,
fear. But more than that IS there not somethmg e\s ? Anger? Hatred? Hope? And yes
a fru~tlatlon too But fear, fear Oh. God.
What a deed. AI! of a sudden the leader of
the band shoots the foremost of the peasants,
the oldest among them, the patriarch The
old man falls down bleedmg. Blood,
Blood -Red, Red; He flmgs the can which
was on hiS lap and out flows a long spurt of
red; a spurt which purges the blank whltew
ness of the canvas. And then he hurls hlffiself at the canvas With all the elements in
him eXCited-crash. The Jagged and torn
canvas-the monument. Monument to what?
To the war? No To the suffenng ? No.
To what? A monument to the futIlity of
hfe And then the vIsIonary, the enhghtened VISIOnary sees the canvas-nay, he sees
Life.
