Ranjoo Somoo-The Last of the Kodavas
If there IS one species of lIT Ian that It IS
fast becommg extinct, It IS the noble Kodava.
When I first started on thiS lIT trip there
were no less than three of them around and
now, sadly enough, their numbers have vastly
dwmdled leaving us With no more than oneRanJoo, the last of the Kodavas
RanJoo, as history books wdl some路day no
doubt have cause to mentIOn, IS believed to
be a direct descendant of the famous Greek
Warnor GUflJOO who landed on the shores of
Malabar With the rest of the Kodavas-to-be a
thousand years ago. In fact, nearly all the
Kodavas of to-day are hIS direct descendants.
GunJoo was qUite a guy. So was DhanJoo,
hiS half路brother, who opted to go to Persia
mstead and subsequently, to Bombay. We
have a direct de~cendant of his In the BIOMechanics department here
Ranjoo hails from Mercara which IS, we are
told, a beautiful little town set in the heart of
the Coorg hills where the Somoo family makes
ItS home. One can pIcture httle RanJoo
gambolhng around the forests of Coorg With
hiS play路mates breathmg fresh, clean mountam
air and feedmg on roots, bernes,raw meat and
(Jther Kodava delicacIes One can see him
stealthllv creepmg up on an unsuspecting
wIld boar WIth hIS 'ptecha Kathl ' or huntmg
kmfe between hIS teeth. To be surt, young
~nJ()o was growmg up to be a strappmg lad
m the finest Kodava tradition. Of course, he
'was developIng a few eccentncltlcs such as
pamtmg. But then, you can't have everythmg.

RanjOo fiOlShed hiS schoohng from the
Samik school, Tnvandrum and was qUite a
guy there, tOpplOg the class and representlOg
the school 10 everythlOg from footer to needlework. HIS only draw-back was that he was
tlOgOO which, lfl the Coorg dialect, means
short. Well, approximately More to the
consternatIOn of the elders hiS mterest 10 palOtmg grew until he, horror of horrors, actually
preferred the pamt-brush to the peecha Kathl
or the 500 express.
I first saw RanJoo when he came to Godavan 10 the begmnmg of hiS second year. I
remember him toddllOg around the hostel
lookmg With respectful deference at no mighty
senIors Meanwhile, he was becommg qUite
a hockey player 10 hiS own rIght. Remember
the match agamst Deihl, the defend 109 champIOns at the Kharagpur Meet when he kept
the enure Delhi team at bay for all of an
hour~

Then the transformation came. How, when
and where, nobody knows. Some say that
RanJoo went to sleep one flight and woke up
the next morOlng to find that this PYjamas had
grown a foot shorter He rushed to the
muror and 10 and behold, there he was 5'9" tall But walt, what was that shadow on
hiS chm ~ He looked closer. By the great
horn spoon, a beard. Stubble on hIS chm.
Even a plmple or two I Thus It was that
RanJoo became a man The elders of the
tnbe exulted. That night there was WIld
reJoIcing at the vl!lage. Almost Simultaneously,
strange girls began rmgmg him up and
mVltmg hIm out.

Speakmg of gIrlS, they, 10 general, tend
to get pretty fond of Ranjoo as a SardarJI
soothsayer once told him May be ItS because
of hiS eyes which generally have a far路away,
Wistful look cibout them. Glazed IS the
word I would use Not that I am saymg all
thiS. The soothsayer, in the process of
saying the sooth was apt to digress a bit.
Despite the long and weary years at the
Institute, RanJoo stIll retams hIS ancestor
Gunjoo's plOneenng spmt. The year before
last he and Victor hit the long road to
Kathmandu. They came back better, deeper,
broader persons, \Hth a whole range of new
Interests. RaOJoo played amateul photographer
throughout the trIp. Unfortunately, he had
qUite forgotten the eXIstence of the lens cap of
his camera. So the entne tnp went unrecorded.

If I have not mentIOned anything about
Ranjoo skill With the pamts so far, it IS
because anythmg I say on that subject Will
have the familiar rmg of the common place.
It would suffice to say that he IS too creative
for an Engmeenng carrero
Ranjoo's plans for the future are vanegated.
He hopes to start an advertIsing agency,
practitc archItecture as a career, hItch-hIke
around the world to mention only a few. All
the best RanJoo. Mayall your dream" "orne
true.
Meet you at ChlOchpokli.
