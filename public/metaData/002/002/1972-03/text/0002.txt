HITCH·HIKE TO BANGLADESH
One fine mornmg, a sudden wave of
msplratJon swept over myself and three of my
colleagues at Hmdusthan Motors, Calcutta.
We decIded to hllch-Illke to Jessore on the 25th
and 26th December 1971. So \~e started off
with a bang from the tactory on the mornmg
of the 25th and went to Sealdah, the Calcutta
Railway StatlOn, where we launched on a
shoppmg spree, buymg such tillngs as grub,
bo07e, fags and Chlclets We then boarded a
tram to Bongoan, a border town on the Indian
Side, where we had our lunch In a shack
But good Lord I The grub, was not good,
~omeg\3n wood
We then walked at a
scorchmg pace to Benapole, the Indian Border
checkpost.
The checkpost at Petrapole was the only
mdlcatlOn that we had crossed mto B'l.ngl,\desh-wluch we did on foot The rollmg
fields dotted with splashes of yellow mustard
flower" and date palms m earthenware posts
wIth mIlestones flashmg by were a sIght to see.
Now and then we came across a number of
bunkers by the roadside or an occasIOnal
ammumtlon dump, but these somehow no
longer looked like the Instrurr ents of war which
I presumed they must have been before the
Itberanon. Suddenly, what seemed from a
distance to be a dusty earth track cuttmg aclOSS
the hOrizon materlahsed Into a lme of defence
25 mtles from Jessore ThiS I heard, was
the famous camouflaged outer defence lme.
The 11\usion of serefilty vanIshed as we
passed pill boxes and bunkers cleverly
camouflaged as haystacks and hillocks on
eIther Side of the road and we were then
confronted a few mdes later With the seconda better camouflaged and more formldabledefence IIDe Then came our relief III the
form of an IndIan major m a Jonga Jeep like
Lord Krishna on a chanot. The major was
supposed to have been engaged In the toughest
and the most bloody fight at KushtJa
In the recent war.
Why could not the
Paklstafils hold theIr hnes? we asked the
major. • The PakManls have a very brave
and very well tramed army, but I thmk
their bunkers must have been manned b" the
Amencans' replied the major With a wmk.
• How are PakIstan prIsoners of war treated? •
was our next question to which he rephed
• they get anythmg they want but women.'
The major then amplified his answer to the
first questIOn With an example of how a
couple of Razakars (With Just thetr rifles)
held a SIzeable Indian army at bay.
The road to Jhlkargacha branched off
South
and
ran through countrySIde
untouched by war (so I heard) until we
reached Kadamtola, a mile from Satkhtra
where a dusty dIVersIOn WInds through paddy
fields, over an Indian Engmeers-built
fioatlflg wooden bndge, avoldmg a demolIshed
one. From Satkhua to Jessore IS a long
two hour dnve. A MukhtJ BahIDI camp With
aU ranks attendmg a roU call parade flashed
by: the sentry snapped to a swart' present
arms'.
Ten miles [rom Jessore We crossed a
pontoon bndge flanked by the rums of a
railway and a road bndge. Our convoy was

CAMPASTIMES
conducted across With the Indian army's
seemmgly caloual, yet metlculous, effiCiency.
A few mllelo of excellent tarmac, and suddenly
the raped, charred and ~hell pocked ruinS
of JeSloore's Hmer defence hne came Into
VISion Here three major operations, I belIeve,
took place. In April-May the East Pakistan
C1Res had taken It from the l'akH,tan army. The
Pakistan army had retaken It later only to be
dnven out by the ddvancmg Indian forces and
the Mukhtl Bahml.
The major then dropped us at J essore takmg
an offshoot from where he was gomg at
6.00 p.m. 1ST or 6.30 p.m EST. The locals,
takmg us for reporters, took us to the Mukhtl
B,llullI camp where we met Maj. Manner,
MaJ Hafeez dnd Lt. MUJlbhlr Rehman. We
notIced the Mukhtl Bahlnl Guenllas cradlmg
their stens or Ichapore semi-automatiC
machine gun~. An officer proudly pOinted
Ollt a sten carbine and told liS that the
Mukhh Bahml preferred our stens to the
Chmese or Amencan ones. The former,
I beheve IS a bit too heavy whll<' the latter IS
complicated and prone to JammIng on rough
handlmg.
After checkmg our Identity, Maj. Hafeez
took us around the town on a VISit. On the way
he showed us the CirCUit house, the telephone
house, etc. Then after havmg dinner With
them (wllh our own bread) we were given a
place to sleep comfortably with a guard posted
for protection
The Mukhtl Bahllll at that hme was very
busy and on the run to capture all the
Razakal sand Blhans, the col1aborators of
PakIstan army and .. hoot then after falf tnal.
The Mukhtl Bahml was also kmd enough to
give us a lot of souvemrs such as live bullets
and cancelled letter heads of Bangladesh
Armed forces With then autographs.
In the chill weather next mormng, the
Mukhtl Bahml after buying us our breakfast
conducted us on a long walk to Bapurnapad,
the tragIc suburb of Jessore where proof
of all the attrocltles committed by Pakistan
army could be clearly seen. The dead bodies
had been thrown mto underground sewage
tanks to rot m there as food for the
human-blood-hungry flies.
The sex hungry Pakistan army accordmg
to the locals and the Mukhtt Bahlnl raped
any female they captured for five successive
days With hardly any rest and later either
shot or cropped off the gIrl's head.
Wah all due thanks to the Mukhtl Bahmi
havmg been paid, we parted company and
went on towards the Cantonment. The
Cantonment was littered WIth guttled
Pakistan tank3-mamly Chaffees. In the barracks, off duty Jawans were Iymg about m the
wmter sun smokmg, playtng cards or mspecttng their kills. At an Intact officers' mess
hall, decorallons had been put up for the
Chnstmas Burrakhana (m whlch aU ranks Sit
down together) for the prevIOUs mght
Jessore town Itself was not very badly
damaged though a few houses were shellscarred.
At the corner of the deviatIOn from
Jhlkargacha to lessore, we came aross a
Pakistan ammUnitIon truck blasted by them-

selves when It was supposed to have broken
down. The roof top of a school called B. M.
High School had been demohshed by the
rascally Pakistan army. as the locals put It,
to fill the bunkers The locals, I must thank
them, presented all us With Souvemrs
such as Rocket launchers. bunets, grenades,
etc. (all blasted of course).
The slow return to normality, I think,
has been hampered by a lack of public
lfiltlatlve ThIS I suppose IS because, tho~e
endowed With lnlt1atlVe and enterprise
have either been killed or have run
away or Jomed the Mukhtl BahInI
And
the Bahlm It looks, does not want to take
any poltcy deCISions on how the banks,
schools, colleges (Without students how can
they be run? ) and other public inStitutiOns
should be re-opened and run
Havlldar Tangavelu, a Tamllian, attached
to our army was kmd enough to offer us a
drop III hIS vehicle when all the other CIVIIJan and army vehIcles snubbed us and drove
us to desperation, Mr Tangavelu dropped
us at Berapole where we were mistaken for
the Mukhtl Bahlm by most people. The
Brook Bond staB manager at the border
Mr. Karmakar, deserves credIt for savmg
four lives by givIng us free tea and packs of
fags, not that we were broke
One very mterestmg piece of mformatlOn we
collected from a very rehable source was that
of the Mukhu Bahlnl, one lakh In number were
tramed at Chakuha, Decgarh and Jandlh In
Bihar and Barrackpore and DarJeehng In
West Bengal.
ThiS artlc\e wdl not be complete If
don't thank all those people who are responSible for makmg thIS triP, a pleasant and
memorable one Before I end thiS article, r
suggest that our Nepal heroes, Victor and
RanJu, hitch-hIke to Bangia Desh.
I am
sure, they will enjoy every mch of their
way.
