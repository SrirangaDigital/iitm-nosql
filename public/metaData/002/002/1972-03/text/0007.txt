March 19721

I was browsmg through some old copies of
Compastlmes one day The gU)S who mfested
tillS p1ace before we moved IU seem to have
had a lot more varIety In theIr versIon of
thIS rag. We seem to have completely forgotten about thmgs lIke the 'Classified
Dlvertlsements' and 'Lettencks'. There IS
no chance, nowadays, of a letter, appearing In
the' personal' colum of Composttmes, statmg,
'I, Gautam Mahajan, on reslgmng the
edItorship of Campasttmes, shall hereby
eschew all pretensIOns to greatness. My
name shall therefore revert to Gautam Jan'
In those days, the outlook of the magazme
was much narrower. It was concerned solely
WIth I1fe on the campus. The outlook of the
modern verSIOn 15 much broader. Every
tOplC from the Umverslty of Berkeley to
Venkataraghavan IS covered In detail. Once
to a great whde, an arucle about lIfe out here
does turn up III the rIght hand corner of
the fourteenth page The rest of the space IS
cluttered up WIth the vIews of the pmks,
the reds, the pseudos, the psychotics, the
neurotics, the congeOltal Idiots, the editorial
board and some InfOrmation on how some
obscure RUSSian grandmaster whaled the tar
out of another equally obscure RUSSian grandmaster by qUIetly pocketmg hIS opponent's
rook when the other chap was not lookmg
The magazine as a whole makes sense to
no one. To be sure, a dozen fanatics, scattered round the hostels, can understand parts
of It, mamly because they wrote It themselves
The general pubhc IS left at sea. The end
result no one bothers to read It.
Don't blame the ed,torlal board for every~
thing. We are dOlOg our best to keep the
carcass alive. We need help

INVIGlLATOR'S PARADISE
InvIg!1ators In exammatIon halls are havmg
a very tough hme these days. They have to
match witS WIth candidates Who spend more
t!IDe and energy than ever before 10 contemplatmg mgeruQus schemes to delude, decoy
and exasperate InvlgIlators In many cases
It appears that candIdates spend more tIme
and employ greater mental exertIon In deVISIng
these complJCated schemes than in preparmg
fOI the exams themselves Apart from theIr
mgenulty bemg msulted, mVlgIlators are also
now constantly In danger cf gettmg Injured
when angry candIdates assault or thrash them
for mte1fellng with theIr daulmg schemes
of deceptIon Gone ale the days when an
mVlgdator could tnumphantly order a blushmg
candIdate to leave the hall Now even If
he raIses h~s fingle or an eyebrow In diSapproval, he hazards hIS hfe. The authontles
of a certam collf.-ge \\ere rackmg theIr brams
to find some method to rescue the poor JfiVlgllators from such odJOJS treatment. Their
alann knew no bounds when they heard that
the latest schemes evolved by the candidates
Involved the mcomprehenslble phenomena of
ESP, lIke telepathy, psychokmeSIS etc. as well
as advam.e Imported technology WhICh effectively employed mmlature radl,) transmitters,
taperecQrders etc The alarm soon gave
way to a dctermtnat!on to ta(.kle the probh.m.
The tlmt has come, they firmly deCIded, to
crack down on such malpl actlce.s and end
them for eva Thc.y sought at great Lxpcnse,
expert adVIce and JO due. wurse came up With
a schc.mf.-, which thty hoped, wOllld for once,
beat th.e candldate.s at the.lr own game. Accordlfigly on thur next c.xaml11atlOn day, the
students of the college were confronted With

CAMPASTIMES

IITM of the seventies IS perhaps very much
dIfferent from IlTM of the slxtles mostly
m the pnnclples and IdIOsyncraCies of the
elected Gymkhana members. Whereas In
those days, thesc member~ believed 10 Shakespeare'l! words (What IS In the name? ... ) now
they seem to concentrate more all. the names by
which varIOUS organlsation'l and members
should be called and xn clecldmg what these
orgalllsatlons should do and what they should
not, forgettxng the major fact that there are
much more Important thIngs like the problems
and dIfficulties mvolved 10 gettlfig certam
thmgs dOll.e-forgettmg the fact that the
Gymkhana IS not the sole powerful body
legally permitted to do anything that IS done
In the name of the Institute
If the purpose
IS common and IS condUCIve to the well bemg
of everyone, whether It IS Jawan's Welfare
FWld campaIgn or anythmg else, there IS no
sense In all.yone talking of parallel orgamsatlOns
runmng-there IS no sense 10 these so-called
powerful guys gomg about Impendmg and
restrictIng the efforts of others

Campasizmes has always been a medium
of free thmkmg-free from all mterference
from external sources-an autonomous body
of editors who produce the cream of unbounded
thought-and I personally feel that It should
remam so 10 the future years And If the
Gymkhana feels that It should bec.ome part of
the Gymkhana and should be under the
control of the Gymkhana and one of the
Gymkhana members should be on the edltonal board, they would be comnuttmg a
perfect combmatlon of eaor and mJustlce.
Small conversatIOns to thiS effect are m progress
and they had better stop nght there, for the
editor should be gIven full lIberty to choose
hIS team and full liberty to consult WIth them
and dende about what to prmt all.d wn'At

a promment notice outSIde the exammatlOn
hall which proclaImed:
The followmg addItIOnal rules shall be
observed In the exammatlOn halls With UllmedIate effect
I
Candidates are stnctly f Jrbldden to
CDmmUlucate WIth each other through telepathy.
It has been observed for qUIte some time now,
that e~en candidates who SIt at Opp!lsite corners
of large examInatIon halls produce IdentIcal
answers to the same questIon. After much
bram rackmg over thIS mystenous phenomenon the <luthJntlcs have concluded that
telepathIc communicatIOn IS responSible.
Therefore as a precautionary measure, hypelsensItive electroencephalograms are bemg 1.ilstalled at strategIc powtS In the hall to momtor
the blal" ~a"es of candIdates. ThIS com• pltcated bIOnIC ensfmble IS capable of detectUlg
several tclt:pathlc commuOlcaUons at a tmle,

some hlghly skIlled, telepathic lamas from
TIbet have been re(rUlted lS fullume mVlgIlators. Candlrlates arc warned that these
lamas are Judo experts and any attempt to
assault them Will have disastrous consequences.
Any candIdate caught USl11g telepathy, either
by the lamas or by the electroencc.phalograms
shall be summanly dismissed from the hall.
2. CandIdates shall enter the hall, only
through open doors. They shall not tunnel

sensItive enough to emIt a sereechmg sound

We talk of SOCIety, we talk of culture-we
talk of so many Isms--so many bIg thmgs that
we can't Wlderstand ourselves. But the fact
(whIch is not all that plam) rcmams thclt most
of us sull are not cultured or CIVIlised enough
to Wlderstand what exactly IS btmg part of
modem sotlety-the conllervahve-mmded
should note that modern sO'lety need not be
full of people WIth loose morals-modern
socIety h~s Just got that Wllque qualIty of
freedom of expressIOn and actIOn wlthm the
bounded llffilts of an acceptable moral code.
But what one falls to Wlderstand Is-why
are there sull some frustrated lot of people
(m our campus too I) who being totally unaware of these baSIC facts about modern
soclety. should find somethmg wrong wlth
almost anythmg they see or hear about. Both
parents and our local guardians here, the
teachers wIll be doing us a great amount
of good If they could stop be~ng severe about
the smallest thmgs and It would be even
better If our great unwashed start beIng a bIt
more senSible 111 then "lews.
