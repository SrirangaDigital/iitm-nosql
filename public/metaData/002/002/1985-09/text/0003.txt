BANNER OF PEACE

Rate filled cowards hldmg behmd mask
Who show sorrow for a m/lfule fee

Who has driven you away?

The world cries for peace
The unborn In the mOlher's IIc;mb
The tinY toddlers
Look up to you
Where are you peace? Where
can I jind you?

The war or the weapons')
The bombs or rhe blas.s
The /ratred or greed
Where are you lost?

Where are
