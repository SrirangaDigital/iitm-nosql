TCLhnology means sCience SCience IS a vast subject, so IS life.
SClcnce means kno\\ledge vcnfied kno\\ledge, derived trom 11 Sincere
and cntlcsl study of expenencc, exp~nence at all levels.
Technology may have answer to 311 the questIOnS, questions
relating to Man and hiS enVironment What exactly IS tbe nsture of
Man the finest prodUct of nature s evolutIOn Man 10 hiS true nature
IS th~ Atman, the self, blrthless and deathless Pure and perfect The
UI'IIVer~e, the source of SCience, also IS Atman
It IS spIritual
through and through
Technology IS capable of sol\IDg matenahstlc needs of Manwhlch
may hdp resol\c Irony problell's But the other Side of matenahstlc
development IS equally essential - the spltltual development
Total
Integration In Man IS possIble only through dual development harmony
of lechnologlcal and spmtual energies, where n~ two energIes conflict
With each other but blend With the rest to create pattern of all round
p:rfect!on.

On the function of Art·
- - Firstly, ( don t thank Art should have a runCl10n Even If It does.
It changes from lime to time Earher It was used to propagate Rehglon
Then It became a media for the monarchs Today Art has come out
of such a rigid role With tl/ne, the purpose of Art has also changed
An cllample would be portraits Once photography came, the Idea
of portraiture has changed Nobody wants an artist to do a portrait
these days Does that answer the questIOn? (thmk a\l Art springs
from one'~ urge to satisfy himself I pamt Simply because I enJoy It.
When I am m the process of painting I forget everythmg IIround me.
lt IS a media, I get Into, when I want to create somethmg. Ultimately,
It IS a process of self dIscovery
Does the M an In the Street matter-'J
Yes and nO I would like h101 to partiCipate m my pamttng. But
I have no Idea of pretendmg to be superfh.lal and paint for someone
who does not know Art
Are there any patterns and shapes that intrigue you?
I am fascloated by the MANDALA - a tantflk Image which IS
about 2500 years old It IS said to be a MAP of the UNIVERSE There
IS a timeless quality about It, a permenance which I admire.
How does a Painter's Idea of time dlfTer from a Novelist's?
it IS a httle difficult for a p,unlcr to clnswer such a questton My
medlUDl IS Visual, and I thmk my palDtlngs can answer thiS question
bettcr than what I cao.

PRAISE f ACKNOWLEDGEMENT AND OTHER PSEUDO STUFF
Among the hazards of lIVIng 10
the society of homo sapiens IS the
load of unsoliCIted praIse one has
to contend With Now I can see
the IDdJorllY of my readers hody
denymg the
truth
of that
statement But may I suggest
that maybe It IS the soliCited praise
whIch Isn t always forlhcomlllg.
For me however, the dl,uncuon
between praIse and flattery has
long since vanished, as comph
ments for all manner uf virlues
and ViceS ImaglOed Of real get
heaped on IT'y pate If only some
h:>nest-to gOodness cntlclsm would
come my way I might endeavour
to take It ~enously
Now what would have provoked
that IOverted outburst? Well, the
last straw was the thanks rendered
by the edItors of campa!.tlmes for
the exp'nenced hand lent out to
Ih m (SIC) The fact Is that It
tdxed my IDgenulty dodgmll their
eifors .l!t geltJOg a contnbutlon

out of me. which has landed me IQ
hi the august company of the
tYPist and the copYing machlOe
operator and the electflclan and
the mike IDln dod the chief guest
and the pattent audience and
others to
whom our eternal
gratitude IS always guaranteed
I Shall revert to the present bunch
of editors later on The prevIous
of were by 00 means tnnocentthey actually accused
me
of
modesty, of all things Any halfWit who managed to wade through
my artJcle~
wuh their hIgh
frequency of 'l's and 'me's, should
have been rapIdly disabused of any
s\lch notion There IS another
name f If lnodesty proclaimed
ftom the r wf tops (startlOg With
'y' and ending WIth the same two
letter~)
N,lt to
mentIOn the
SUbtle Myles of .tffectcd modesty
LlvlOg on (or IS It off?) a
p~endo-reputatIOn
makes
life
needlessly complicated. Once upon

a time there was a character who
wrote some parodies for camp astunes under the psendonym Tee
Square
He remained happily
ob~cure In hl~ tlOle, but some 'Posthumous' reprmtIDg of some of the
pieces apparently gave rise to some
myths regardmg hiS character.
Over the years they seem to have
been repcated ad nauseam, and
methmks Tee Square has been
flattered too hberal\y The object
he symboltzed IS now obsolete
as an mstl ument for the oppression
of engtneenng students.
Tne present reIncarnation bears
no resemblance to either the myth
or the erstwhile reahty. Whenever
thiS one puts pen to paper the flow
IS more often btle
or vmegar,
whereas the
functionaries of
campastlDles (and Focus) keep
clamounng for hghter staff. No
go Time wreaks ItS changes on
styles
and tastes alike.
Let

pompousness and IQnuendo give
way to some Jntelhglole WTltlDg.
Before closmg let me get back
at the editors and return their
comphments In hke measure.
The new format of campashmes,
product of a real printing press, IS
a \\elcome reversion to the pracl)ce
ofhme. gone by (Asserting tbat
old IS gold IS conSidered a safe
attitude 10 questionable Situations!)
All the urel1lnmary work \\ hlch
went mto orgaOlzmg the pnntmg
busmess may not be eVIdent In the
final product, but It took up a
major part of lhe summer vacatIon,
as I CQuld observe from a strategIc
distance of course And they are
/!omg to have their hands IIllghty
full nursmg the baby In Its new
attIre for two whole semesters,
So here 5 Wishing them best of luck.

Tee square.
