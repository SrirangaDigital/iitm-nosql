Light blue shift, dark blue pants wjth m1j.tcbmg

b~ckonln&, I -,onloOkers like a pamted sales-girl
trying all trlcks to &elJ stockmgs to men

The bus paused for a funeral procession
to pass by. Some urcblDS were danclDg to the
drum beat, laughmg lfi the assurance of the
5 bucks that they'd get after It was over.

He got down and crossed the mad crowd
to reach the consulate
He saw a crowd of
twenty, "all sweating profusely In the Alc
WaltlDg Room Probably they should put up
a 'No sweaung' sign, he thought He Saw
the slightly familiar faces from Gumdy & IIT
Everyone looked as If hiS death sentence
would be read out sbortly In a few minutes.
He saw 'Baldy' movmg towards him
.Baldy' was from GUindy and they knew each
other well

~'Hello

Sheikh,

"Yeah, Stanford Was It In the air?"
"No Reagen told me," be laughed, "God 1
You IlTlans always get the best places. I thmk
the guys In Stanford advertise. 'Non-IITlans
need not apply' or somethmg
Sheikh was clearly embarassed.
But 'Baldy' continued Without remorse,
"I doo't see that many II'l'1ans here. Does
that mean SHE's there ?"
"I don't know for sure", he 'replied.
"Nobody knows for sure, even herself" he
chuckled • Not after that 1I1cldent. She took
leave for a day and word was out bJt 10 J~ f»aDd by ooon balf of liT waS cleared and guys
were out of the country by the week-end.
How's that for piltnotJsm ?"
Sheikh did not deem It necl1ssary to reply.
Th,s Btatn-Draln thmg was lQ,tellectual bullShit, he thought to him, he was merely
fOI[OWIPg t~e great poet Bharathl's words
"Sail the seven seas, and
Seek the world's treasures".

slowly, "But you can do yout PG course
thIS field In one of your own lIT's or you can
,ge~ a very good Joh and settle down bere."

He WInced at the mention of PG courses
at lIT's He wanted to argue With her. Bllt
he controlled hlmse) f
"But Madame, thiS field IS qUIte new to
India So I'd hke to go to U S. and study
there I'll surely come back" He was
pleadIng, thiS tIme
She didn't seem to be convmeed

"Mr Shekhar, How IS that everyone who
comes to me IS the only son to hiS parents, has
lots of money and wants to serve hiS country
by slttmg In US? 1£ a young man ill U. S.
had so much money, he would never study_
There are better thlDgS to do ID US than
studymg I'm sorry Mr Shekbar, I can't glve
you the VISA'
He was stunned. He suddenly felt far too
weak to nse He felt hiS muscles go limp.
He wanted to beat up that lady. Who the hell
does she tbmk she IS? He could do nothmg,
He slowly pIcked up hiS papers and left.
OutSide, the heat waS oppresSive Damn

Presently hiS number was called. And
, Sheikh stiffened With tension Was 'she' there
