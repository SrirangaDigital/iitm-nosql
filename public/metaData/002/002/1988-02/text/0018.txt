My throat is parched and I feel

dizzy. I sit down under a tree and try a mouthful of the
stuff in the bowl. It is too rich. I retch. The effort

JOURNEY TO 21ST CENTURY
The bullock cart moves on
With its wheels rolling over
The asperltlesof the old road
Cart driver sighed and thoughtI will change the wheels
As he could do nothing with the road!
The bullock cart moved on
With the bullocks labouring
Against the steep gradient ahead
Driver cursed the bullocks
And thought I would change them
As he could do nothing with the read
How could we go to 21st century
When the path is full of asperitles
of race, caste, money
And the hlllocks of corruption in the way
Change the bullocks of government
Change the wheels of machinery
Can't the cart driver
Change

the

roads

21st century is up in the Zenith
Where only parallel lines meet!
