on the co-operation existing between departments.
Another aspect is that many of these computer rooms/centers close
at around 5 in the evening.

Certainly this amounts to a thorough waste

of computer time. Instead of maintaining a rigid attitude about rules et
a1, ostensibly for security reasons, alternatives should be thought of to enable
students

to make

most of

these

facilities.

The fact is, if

it

has been made

possible in one department, it should be in others too.
A

word

on

the

water

problem.

Curiously

enough, while

the

rest

of

the city has been receiving an increased supply of water, the situation in
the hostel zone looks none too bright. it is hard (water) times ahead for
the

hostelites.

The

institute,

having

decided

upon

Lapping

ground

water

to

the fullest, has stopped the tanker supply. The hardship is being compounded
by the removal of

tag from the bathrooms. (May be it has got something

to do with the 'tapping' mentioned earlier 1!. Sorry, if you iound that a
bit dry. You know we are not to blame I

To the hassles with which this issue seemed to be riddled was added
another, which we confess, we didnâ€˜tforsee,sheer paucity of electric type-

writers that function in the institute. In this context, the diversity of 'types'
in

which the

articles have

been

typed

is, we

hope, understandable; for

they

were done on different typewriters to expedite the release of this issue.
Although we had planned to release this issue before MG, its now
inevitable,

that

another

MG

would be

consigned

to

memory, before

we

are

through. We will bring the best offerings of MG '88 in our next issue.
Until then

Compromise is but the sacrifice of one right or good in the hope of retaining
another - too often ending in the loss of both.

The

cynic

is

one

who never

sees

a

good quality

to see a bad one. He is the human owl,

in a man and

never

fails

vigilant in darkness and blind to

light, mousing for vermin, and never seeing noble game. The cynic puts
all human actions into two classes - openly bad and secretly bad.
Henry W. Beecher
