EXOTIC THOUGHTS OF A QUIXOTIC FELLOW
____________________

of Knights and their deeds I've often read
And envied them deeply for the lives they lead;
And their noble missions the land to free
From dragons and witches and sorcerYO for those romantic days of old
When women were chaste and men were bold
And Knights were noble as noble can be
And followed the norms of chivalry
When hearts were strong and men were brave
And damsels in distress were plenty to save
And the air was pure and kept you in fettle
To gallop and wallop and show men your mettle.
When a lady was escorted by Knights in armour
Raring for battle with anyone who'd harm her
Gallopping alongside,reckless to tilt
Not pausing a moment till blood was spilt.
When all around me I'm saddened to find
The deplorable state of human kind
Often in my fantasy do 1 blissfully fly
And recapture the flavour of times gone by
And find solace in visions galore
Of those thrilling, swashbuckling days of yore.
Krishna Bharat

DREAM
Had a dream at night
Was blind
My fingers touched your face
Could feel the upstick
And the tears also
Could smell the beauty
You're so frail
Like the poems I read in braille.
Vishnu Teerth
