long before he entered his cock in a few fights, and to his great joy, it won
in most of them, bringing handsome sums of money.
it was then that he conceived of the grand plan to invite the local
expert himself to pit his bird against his. Naturally this aroused tremendous
interest in the village and a great deal of betting took place. The day of the
contest arrived. When he went to the coop the give his bird, feed, he was aghast
to see

it

lying
