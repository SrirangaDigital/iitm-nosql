Last but not the least ,
this writer is in a quandary as
why
none of these plays are accompanied

only
when the atmosphere is charged

of subtle enrapturement and be literally made to
imbibe

emotional upheavals that the characters go through .

Devoid of

REJOINDER TO THE ABOVE ARTICLE
As a dramatics coordinator, 1 would like to say that
I have done my best to promote dramatics in the Institute.
1 have organised a workshop and done a few other things.
There is always scope for improvement.
As regards the article by Spring, I only wasted my time
consulting the dictionary and do not feel obliged to defend
myself,for all those who attended the festivals of plays
over the years know the truth.

Since
the radius of the sphere is immaterial ,
our problem has
a
unique solution .
The size of the hole is proportional to the size
of
the sphere . the remaining volume of the sphere being always constant
Extending
this
concept
,
the
hole size will tend to
zero
as
the
diameter
of the sphere
approaches
6 cm . Hence
the
solution is the
volume of a sphere of radius 6 cm.
( ﬂaths Buffs can prove the above through integration )
