Yes, I will try again; I decide as I look out of the

Bofors of Sweden

(may their bribes decrease),

Arose on morn to shatter the peace
Of a harried PM, bothered by Fairfax.
And at the very whiff of kickbacks
Cried V.P. Singh. the PM's nemesis,
'Thine bankers are the Credit Swisse
And thou hast a plane ready at safdarjung".
And with these words a surprise was sprung
0n Lamboo and brother.

And lo and behold,

A dozing MP in Parliament grew bold.
To actually snatch papers from a Minister
With all the gusto he could muster.
But alas! Bofors refused to show or tell,
Prompting the Opposition to move an official
In Sweden, requesting investigations
Into Bofors' generosities and prevarications.
And in the meantime Win Chaddha had run
Right from under the nose of the lawmen.
The result-Rajiv is in the hot seat
Facing more demands that he can meet.
Let him beware, another is in View
Even bofor he can say HDW.
