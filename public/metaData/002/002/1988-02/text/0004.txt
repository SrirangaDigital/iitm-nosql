Uhat about training for students

PS

He started installation of the system from 23rd Nov. and
completed
it on 7th Dec.
Immediately after ,
I
invited
three
members from each dept. {or a short course . Right now the system

is under

learning

:
But will there be any courses speciticaiiy Lor students 7
PS
:
Yes ,
of course .
He will be organising
courses
for
advanced
topics
.
Ue
are also preparing User's
Hanuals
with
information
like how to compile in Fortran ,
Pascal or Cobol
;

how to program in F77 etc.
There are other manuals which will be
tied down to the terminal rooms .
I am also thinking of brineing
out a plastic folder having a
tying it to each terminal .
CT
:
Is there any proposal
PS
:
As
I
said .
there

collection

of

oft

terminals separately . Once these are solved ,
can't have terminals in the hostels .

approach
us

Administrators .
The disk space will be alloted according to the
needs of the users .
For example ,
research scholaq and
people
working on structural analysis will require more space
CT
:
How many Graphics terminals are there at present ?
PS
:
One .
This is a high resolution PCMXZ colour terminal
with
1024 * 1280
pixels .
It has an 8 color plotter
with

Uireframe modelling is possible on this terminal

By the way , what was the cost of construction of this
new building ?

Somewhere in the region of Rs. 85 lakhs . but I donâ€˜t

o . this is a temporary arrangement only . As I said
earlier ,
we shall be distributing the terminals
Actually its
possible to connect another 70
VT 100
terminals to the system .
These
will be slightly slower that the Siemens terminals
.
Us
can
also connect IBM PCs through a data switch to the
mainframe
to act as VT 100 terminals . So if any of the labs having IBM PCs
went a connection . we can lay a line uptill the lab
The PC can

function on its own , or as a Siemens terminal in the dialogue or
file transfer modes V

Us

are

also

curious

to

know why

there

is

so

much

space

available in the main Computer room .
PS
This is to provide space (or expansion .
Tomorrow if
we
get a supercomputer ,
we should have space for that
.
if
ERG
provides
further
equipment like additional
processors
or
laser printers , the extra space will take care of this

Uhat will happen to the IPL and IBM systems .

The IBM system will have to be wound up

However
a number of application programs like SAP [V are running
