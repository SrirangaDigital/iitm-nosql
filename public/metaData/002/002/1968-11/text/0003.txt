MINITALE'

THE THREAT

-----

"DARLNG, YOU SNG LIE A NGBTNGALE"
On Friday the thirteenth, a man named
Krool walked into the IIT campus. He was a .
determined individual with a hawk-like nose,
a thick mustache, a bushy beard and a sinister
scar that stretched from his left ear to his lip
giving him a perpetual sneer. He had embarked on a ruthless mission a year back, and
he looked forward with malignant delight,
to the day his task would be complete. He
smiled fiendishly to himself and rubbed his
scar thoughtfully. Krool detested anything
which contained the letter • i' and he made
it an order that everything which had an • i '
be destroyed and done. away with. Now this
order was endorsed with the Wamba Seal and
therefore it had to be obeyed without fail.
No one dared oppose any order endorsed with
a Wamba Seal for fear of displeasing the
Higher powers, under whose reign the world
was, in that era.
. Krool had, on his way from Kansas, Tokyo
and Denmark, destroyed automobiles, bicycles
and rickshaws but had left cars, trams, buses
and aeroplanes untouched since they contained
no 'i'.
Within a week of his stay in lIT Krool
made sure that IIT was called T. and Knick
Knack was to have the signboard minus the
• Knick'. Krool also invaded the academic
section. - There were to be 110 periodicals. or
tutorials, but tests, exams and orals continued.
Final exams were barred but the half-yearly
remained.
Krool visited the workshops and saw to it
that the Fitting, Welding and Smithy sections
were demolished, but the carpentry portion of
the workshops lived on.
On entering a hostel and tasting the grub,
Krool was reminded of his mission and so he
bade the cooks to have done with Chappatis,
Rice, Dosais, Vadais and Idlis; Rasam, Curry,
Sambar and Sugar could be had in plenty.
In the academic calendars the year had no
April and the week no Friday. The OAT
(open air theatre) was .to be called the O.T.
because of the unfortunate way I air' was
spelt and no movie was screened. Only
dramas, concerts, dances and farewell speeches
were staged.
Ice-creams were sold no more; instead
cokes were perennially drunk. The games
allowed were football, basketball, hockey and
shuttle. Alas for the cricket-players and the
t.t. fans. '1£ ever cricket were to be allowed
it would be played without the wickets and
bails' , bellowed Krool in answer to the

plaintive query of a player. P.l's. were
cracked by the dozen, but no wit, limerick
or fopoonerism was ever heard of. Parks and
gardens were left as such but no picnics were
had in them . .
Then one fine day Krool announced the
Great Movement according to which words or
things with ' i's ' were to be pronounced without them and not to be banished from existencc.
Speech became practically impossible. A 'bird'
became a I brd' and • mice' became • mce ' .
The Ibrary hours were from eght n.m. to
nne p.m. Chaos reigned in every sphere of
campus life. A chemstry lectUl'er had a
harassing time trying to explain 011saton
potental was ionisation potential and that the
full form of. T.N.T. was trinitrotoluene.
Ca1npastmBS reluctantly acquiesced to Krool's
order. Plural forms changed accordingly and
• rad • was the plural of • radius', or rather. of
, radus '. And the gentleman who hailed out
loudly that he wanted a tax to take him to
Gundy was asked to kndly shut up and keep
quet. Many IlTians, I mean, many Tans,
caught bran-fever and the hosptal was full.
Pretty girls with plaited hair named 'Kumaris'
blushed a deep pink whenever called. An enthusiastic fellow from Tapti, who when complimenting his sweetheart's voice, said, 'Daring,
you sng lke a nghtngale,' was slapped hard on
his cheek. Two fashion models down at
Mt. Road had an awkward hour trying to make
the salesman at a departmental store understand that they wanted bkns and mnskrts to
Wear for a fashion parade. Embarrassing
situations cropped up from nowhere.
Finally, a day arrived when a gentleman
named Smirk decided to defy the Wamba
Seal. He stalked upto Krool, pulled his
moosh, spat on his face and sho,ved him his
place. Krool, the craven cur that he was,
admitted defeat and slunk away.
Gradually, things resumed llormal proportions. The people hailed and cheered Smirk,
proclaimed the day a holiday in his honour
and held a banquet. When Smirk was
requested to bJah a few words, he said 'Better
times have come with the fall of Krool's
regime. Now no one need fear. The '¥amba
Seal will be replaced by the Zingo Seal.
Everything concerned with the letter • 0 '

'Twas a threat that the missive did carry,
Which did the judge, a little bit harry,
, Acquit the criminal, if wish you your life,
And the safety of your family and that of
yourwi£e;
Just a. word about this, to the security
serVIce,
And you and your family, the world shall
miss'
This w~ what in short, the mystic missive
said,
The missive that the judge had many times
read.
But the judge was a man, true and bold;
Said he : 'At .no price shall justice be sold, '
The accused in question was popular and
well kno\~n,
Hence, many to his acquittal had favour
shown '
But the jtidge knew for sure the criminal's
guilt,
And the very thought of acquittal made him
wilt,
• Convicted' i His voice rang out in the
court-room ;
Then homeward he turned, prepared for his
doom.
He prayed for his family, as homeward he
did pace,
His innocent family, which a grave danger
did face.
At home all were safe and happy and gay,
But for the judge it was a very anxious day.
His anxiety did his wife. a great deal annoy,
And wonder she did at the absence of his joy;
For not a word had he said about the threat;
The threat which now made him profusely
sweat.
The next day as he sat. his nervous eyes
blinking,
His wife brought a letter, wondering what
he was thinking.
The sight of the second letter made his heart
sore,
For this resembled the one that came before'
But this 'letter was not in the least mystic. '
'Twas from higher authorities, and he no
longer felt sick,
For it said; • Well done, you heeded not
OUR THREAT;
Now await with glee, the promotion you
shall get.'
