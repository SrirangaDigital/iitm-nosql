Any woman can give you a good time; but
only, a few can put the stars In your eyesthus speaks a hoardrng on the highways.
Another truth IS brought forth to us with
strlkmg lUCidity 'Any man can have a good
time, but a few have the stars In their eyes'
Of course this does not refer to the fashlonnable Introvert who 'pops' In tabs to find
himself rtdmg the crest of an Illusory galaxy
ThiS Just means how scarce the quality
'creativity' IS 'Creativity IS next to Impossible'
says the old gentleman wJth a benevolent tWInkle In hiS eye and a pontifical wave of hiS
hand 'There's too much of a rat race for anybody
to do anything creatIVe' says he With weJlmannered cYnicism It does not seem to make
one hell of a difference to us whether he IS a
detractor of the rat race or ItS most ardent
advocate Not surprisingly, he may turn out to
be one of the educational experts In the country
who just accept the Idea of 'creativity'
although m slightly bad grace as one admits
defect
When Arnold Toynbee says 'To give a fair
chance to potential creativIty IS a matter of lIfe
and death for any society', he does not mean
to jerk a tear out of somebody's eyes It IS an
apocalypse, a gTlm warnmg that a statIc system
IS the dark harbinger that rlOgs the death-knell
of Society
It refers to the tremendous

responSibility that IS reposed In parents and
factors While dealing With their wards Perhaps
the pedagogle luminaries of our country would
like to dismiSS Toynbee's statement of 'Idealtst
claptrap'
In fact there seem to be no educationists and humanists In thiS country. Modern
methods of learnmg h ave been Inducted Into
the system but modern thinking which IS
essential for the development of an indiVidua,
and moulds a person's attitude towards the
world and makes hIm relate himself to things
around him IS sadly missing A modern student
IS aggresSive Without being assertive and complacent WIthout being confident In Western
countries there IS growmg realization of the
fact that emphaSIS has been mislaid on a kInd
of meffectual learning that never motIvates any
thought processes.
The meek acceptance of a paSSive SOCial role
.s all that the student can ach,eve With a static
system of educatJOn The coexpeflence of the
teacher and the student In discovering something together IS a far cry Barking up the
wrong tree and Indulging In a Wild goose chase
do not look so contemptible when a teacher
and a student decide to JOin hands 10 blissfUl
partnership.
The creatIve student - teacher
relationship IS a theme that does not seem to
make sense to our profeSSional researchers
Research has Just become a part of a consume;
market that churns out commodities nicely
packaged to disappear mto the black hole of a
decadent society It IS strange that rn certain
cases the degree of matrrmonlal marketability
conferred upon a research stUdent IS hIgher

than the Ph 0 degree Itself What IS qrast,cally needed IS a thorough reOflentatlon towards
creativity and a rejuvenation of elements of
freshness 10 research outlook In a world
of matenal dross It IS not deSirable to Impose
fmanclal constramts to the extent that the
student prefers to tread the hackneyed path of
eXisting Ideas (m the process carving out a
pedestrian OIche for hImself) Instead of experrmentmg and explOring Adventure becomes a
thmg he saVOurs on the OAT cellurold
screen but It never can become a part of hiS
life Herd conformity' and group instinct'S'
raise their hydra heads In research too and the
upshot IS a bandwagon of Idolators at the
supposedly highest level of mental activIty.
Self expresSIOn becomes a stranger and
a meek, unrpoductlve sameness takes the
place of indiViduality The result IS a glOrified
pen-pusher replete With technICal largon.
When the objectIve of the postgraduate
studies IS believed to be the 'pursuit of
knowledge', research perhaps has to be conSIdered as an
experience
In
creative
understanding rather than as a mere career
On the other hand, material ends lIke elevation
to higher positions seem to determme the
general attitude towards research A Ph 0,
degree IS a fait accompli however moderate the
ability of an mdlvldual IS and sponsors on a
national level seem to regard competency by
the number of publications rather than by their
quality Unless proper IOtellectual exchange
IS the result, conferences and seminars become
mere annual Jamborees and It IS dubIOUS
whether any credence can be afforded to the
conference papers.
Leading institutes lIke ourS seem to take a
thoughtless pride In hOUSing a mUltitude of PG
and research students and are happy that a
sense of equality has been struck With the
UG's If thiS IS achievement, It IS In a retrograde sense
Education can III-afford such
weird objectIves based purely on numbers If
maturity and motivation were prrmary factors
for PG studies, we WIll, much to our surprise
be left With a mlnortty; microscopIC but
creative,
S,nce medlocrrty IS stunningly
regular, a creative indiVidual can be spotted by
hiS 'deviousness' It IS Inevitable that, the
queer fish will encounter problems of adJustment and not surpnslngly he may crack under
psychotIC pressures A latitude on a time
scale IS what he needs to actualize better. slOee
such an mdlvldual's mental process does not
hinge on set perrodlcltles (say 8 to 4 0' clock
routine) The malaise afflicting an instItutIon
IS precisely the lack of creatIve faculty who
can strrke rapport WIth such members of' the
student community.
The cultural environment of an mstltutlon is
what nurtures or kills creative potential. The
inspiration for the actualization of such a
potential cannot be derived from any metaphYSIcal source It has to come only from the
members of the faculty. Who, unfortunately,
are ensconced smugly In layers of IOsu/atlon.
There has been no history that the higher
levels of consciousness 10 a socIety are
represe nted by peop e who are purveyors of
platitudes
The stickier for routme rather
aSSiduously drives the nail Into the coffin of
anything new
A ritual however elaborate,
cannot become a process and glbberrsh can
never take the place of proper communication
The constant devaluation of human standards
In education finally leads to a bankruptcy at
the research level
There has been a quantItative spurt 10 the number of research students
and smce the relationship between the teacher
and the student IS depersonalised and diluted
each student has to Just fend for himself Not
mfrequently a student becomes an albatross
round the neck of a 'mentor' who wants to
Jettison the onus, albeIt WIth a degree
The problems that boggle the mrnd of a
research student In hiS day-to. day eXistence In
an Institute like ours are qUIte a few In number
The globe trotting personages In the faculty
generously contnbute
to
an Impersonal
and
coo I relationship
between
themselves and their proteges
In fact these

the surrogate 'pilot' at home IS more of a
patron than anything else Though electrOniC
trouble-shooting IS the main purpose of C E C ,
thiS Important organ seems to be expending
Itself In actiVities like arranging for training
programmes etc Students Involved In fabrication work a ra at the mercy of the workshop and
an uncomfortable feeling of receiving an
undeserved bounty IS thrust upon a stud!'nt
whenever he has some work carned out by the
said Department. Any misuse of powers In the
allocation of available funds has to be counteracted The delay caused In the disbursement
of fellowsh,p money IS frustrating and It IS
suggested the Institute extend the pTlvllege
(given to normal employees) to the student at
least 10 thiS regard The Interference by selfish
elements 10 research actiVity IS to be
encouraged The energy of the students IS
sometimes harnessed fOT such purposes as
asslstmg their gUIdes 10 the writing of books
and tutoring hiS children Into making the grade
10 certain coveted tests I The question of a
doctoral committee assesslOg the meTits of
research has to be taken more seriously. If
the compOSition of such a commIttee is not
relevant to the fields of research bemg
assessed, a volte-face IS not out of place. One
could do away With such committees and put
an end to thIS pamful farce
A broader
perspective that takes IOta account long term
objectives IS to be exerCised While offe1lng
It IS known that
Research level courses
certain courses offered at the research level are
just a slIghtly more pompous versIon of the
Staff selection
courses at the lower levels
modes have to be conSidered serJously while
the student selection modes themselves require
a lot of fresh thinking and a re01lentatlon 10
obJect.ves. Therein perhaps lies the hope for
better standards In general.
