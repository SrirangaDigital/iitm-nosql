~~use frustration. AVOId them' was
a much.touted,phrase dunng the Emergency
Without being an apologist for that Infamous
era, I wish this sign was prominently displayed
In every office of this Institute
The Image of
a dynamic technological institute geared to
meet the needs of an ever-changing society IS
meant purely for external consumption This
you realise after you have spent a lot of
valuable time and energy getting something
done

The whole affair IS so frustrating and an
exercise In futility that It IS no surpnse that
many people with good Intentions after getting
bogged down In thiS endless redtape Just give
up. All thiS coupled with the dally academic
pressure of penodlcals and attendance regulatIOn effectively ensures that the students remain
totally apathetiC and indifferent to the various
problems that cry out for solutIOn
Insulated
from students and their problems by layers and
layers of rules and regulations, the bureaucracy
plods on memly, obliVIOUS of the frustrations
they are creating No one can deny that some
sort of norms are Imperative for the harmOniOus
functioning of society But should they be
created to Justify the eXistence of a bloated
bureaucracy"l These people are supposed to
help us to expedite things But their behaVIOur
IS reminiscent of the pagan high priests of
Egypt at whost altar the populace was
supposed to pay obeisance It IS a stran£e
anomaly that the Director IS far more approachable and sympathetIc to the students than these
bureaucrats I ThiS was dramatically apparent
dunng the recent water shortage There was
not a drop of water In the hostel zone and
these people were totally indifferent If not
smugly complacent (shades of Nero J}. It was
only the sWift Intervention of the Director that
brought some Succour to the harassed student

population. But It IS Impossible for hIm to
look mto every small Issue that crops up from
time to time. He has to allow hiS subordmates
to handle them. And thiS IS where the endless
buck-passmg and sloth ensures that these
problems are never solved.
Is there nothmg we can do about thIs? Are
we so powerless that a bunch of bureaucrats
can hold US, the so-called cream of the country,
to ransom"l No, surely not' The need of the
hour IS for students to unite and to shake off
their languor. The Director has openly said
that If students are wlllmg to come forward and
propose solutions, he IS ready to accept them
and what IS more Important, enforce them So
let's accept the challenge and show him what
we are capable of. He has also dec/ared that he
has no faith 10 the ability and competence of
the bureaucracy What more tellmg indictment
can there be ?

[Ed:

I Wish to thank all those who helped me
10 bringing out thiS Issue
In particular
I Wish to place on record my grateful
appreciatIOn of the role of our pubhsher
Dr R Natara)an Insplte of haVing a~
extremely busy schedule he was always
aVa/lable to lend a sympathetiC ear to
our grievances and to assist us In every
pOSSible way In fact Without hiS firm,
unswerving support thiS Issue would
never have been pOSSible Secondly I
Wish to thank the Fmance and Accounts
Officer, Mr Namblar who took a personal Interpst In expedltmg many
matters for us lastly I would be
remiss If I were to fail to mention the
contribution of Mr. Sethuraman our
tYPist, Who cheerfully worked even an
holidays to complete our work In record
time]

Sir,
It IS with growmg dismay
that we watch the tcndency
to denude our campus of ItS
vegetation and shrubbery Our
Institute IS Justly famous for ItS
sprawlmg and sylvan campus
inhabited by fauna of various
hues and shapes Our once
beautiful Institute now resembles a malden shorn of her
tresses, bare and defenseless.
We hope the concerned authortties take note of thIS and take
remedial steps to correct thiS
aberration.
Yours truly
SHIVA, SURESH
and Others.
Sir,
The Maintenance Section
(which Includes electriCIans,
plumbers and carpenters) IS
supposed to ensure that student
amenities like the taps, showers
In
the bathrooms, electncal
fittings, etc are always In
working condition Yet their
working hours are the same as
our class hours Ie, 8 00 a m 4 30 p m Isn't thiS ridIculouS 7
Are we supposed to bunk
classes m order to get anythmg
done? Couldn't they come on
Saturday mornmgs"l The same
applies to Ad Block timings
where we experience aVOidable
difficulty
In
paYing
our
mess bills and fees Could not
Campastlmes highlight thiS
genuine problem and get some
SOft of redress.
Yours truly,
R NATARAJAN
(Ed: WE haVE a'('£adv talkEd
to thE DII'(ctOI' about this
In thE: Int(l'YI(W (hOPE yoU
haVE (,Ead It n liE has PI'OmlsEd to
do somdhind
about It).

SIT,
We IITlans as a rule tend
to behave like pampered and
precocIous kids We not only
take the facilities we already
have for granted but are
constantly and s t rId e n t I y
demandmg more
We are
always alert to pounce on the
shortcomings of others (10
most cases, our professors) and
ridicule them ThiS sneermg,
superciliOUS attItude has not
endeared us to our brethren
studYing elsewhere No wonder
they think of us as snobs I Isn't
It trme we did a little introspectlon?
We may discover
some harsh and unpleasant
facts about ourselves I
Yours truly

Sir,
As we students live off
somebody else's earnings, It IS
but right that we do not
mvolve ourselves In things
which may prove detrimental
to progress towards our main
goal Past experience strongly
mdlcates that, In thiS respectPOLITICS IS OUT
So, please make It a pOint,
that you do not publish articles
or letters whIch have pol It/cal
undertones
The
prevIous
Issue of Campastlmes (May
1978) contained such a letter
(to the EdItor).
Generally speaking, If you
have an all fired enthu to show
your love for your country, do
so by Improving your grades.
