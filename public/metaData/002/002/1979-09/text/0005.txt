DEBATE
Over the years, debate m I I T Madras seems
to have become the monopoly of a chosen few
They would have us believe that the strlngmg
together of words and quotations from highbrow
Intellectuals (Faulkner, Toynbee and Camus
berng perennIal favourttes I) delIvered 10 the
, propah' accent IS debate; we b9g to differ
These debates lack paSSIOn The caustic glveand-take, the verbal skIrmishes that are Imperative for the affaH to be exciting and thought
provokmg are conspicuously absent And so,
as we watched the debates thIS year (both the
semiS and the frnals) we COUldn't help
expeTienclng a sense of deja vu And the final
results confirmed our predictions One word
of adVice to the coordinator. No doubt the Idea
of glvrng a pTize for the best InteTJector was
basically sound But the spectacle at the
debate should make you thmk tWice before
having It agam rn the near future For most of
the interjections were palpably absurd If not
downTight stupid! The debatmg team for thiS
year IS

Finally, a convener whose dutIes would
Include convening CounCil meetings,
deCiding agenda, allocating time for diSCUSSion, etc was proposed Nagendra

CCW, Asst Engineers-the elite In short. dOing

There IS no limit to what a few score men.
stTipped to the waist, squatting outside
Ad Block can do ThiS IS no fable but a
summary of the fantastically unbelievable
demonstratIOn held by Krishna Hostel reSidents
on Monday, the 20th of August What fully
clothed men COUldn't do 10 a year half-naked
men did In 3 hours
They brought the
Executive Engrneer runnmg to the KTlshna taps
and showers It IS mdeed a sad commentary
on the state of affairs 10 thiS Institute, which
only reinforces the feeling that direct action
and not peaceful petition 109 WIll get things
done ThiS problem of water shortage IS
nothing new In fact It has been With us for
the past one year or so The only thrng the
authorities have done so far IS to keep trotting
out some rnane excuse peTlodlcally
The
Krishna demonstration which provoked the
Director to take the Maintenance Department
to task seems to have galvanlsed these
normally somnolent gents Iflto action Let's
walt and see what they do

No one can deny, at least not those who
attended the Gymkhana CounCil Meeting that
Major IS an intrepid man It reqUired a lot of
courage to radically depart from tradItIOn and
hold a meeting In a hostel mess. So. full
marks to him for thiS The Meeting got off to
an InauspICIOUS start With the power plaYing
truant ThiS sparked off heated comments
from the secs of Narmada, Tapti, Krishna,
Cauvery, for they have a recuTTIng problem of
power cuts Anyway, power and sanity soon
restored, the Council got down to brass tacks.

In sharp contrast to the dismal spectacle
presented by the other literary events, qUIz rn
I I T. Madras has always been an enjoyable
affair The plethora of qUizzes we keep havrng
(open, Inter-hostel. M G , Inter-collegiate etc)
confirms the dictum that 'you can't have too
much of a good thing' Any fears that the
passrng out of veterans like Snaram and Bharat
Epur would cause a decline In quality were
promptly dispelled as we sat back and /lstened
to the volley of queries fired, not only at
the COntestants but also at the audience Shlva
proved as Impeccable as hiS predecessors In

We can only say:
Congrats. but keep It up I

through smoothly, he was sadly mistaken.
There were plenty of fireworks, mainly prOVided
by Ra)endran Nair (Cauvery Gen Sec) and

and It was only Major's skilful interventIOns
that saved the day
He knew hiS facts
(Kamath. do your homework 10 future ') and
