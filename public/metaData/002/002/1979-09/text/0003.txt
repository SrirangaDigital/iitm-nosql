Campas Times mVltes opinions and views
from all readers on these proposals In the
meantime, It may be Interesting to note the
reactIOns of the student community In I I T.
Deihl to a Similar set of proposal some time
back They were printed In their campus mag
, Pulse' We have taken the liberty of reproducIng some of the more relevant portions here.
"In framing the new rules the attempt has
been to speCify what IS acceptable In routine,
ordmary, day-to-day life, and then to make
separate provlslon(s). wherever necessary, for
emergencies Of for exceptional circumstances.
We see no meTit In mcludlng rules which by
.. un-official" agraement/connlvance of the
authontles ara meant to be "over-looked" m
actual practice" or are merely meant to be
there "on paper". The inculcation of the
belief thaf 'normally , one can ( and should)
merrily go on flouting regulations With Impunity
IS dangerous for a cltlzenery, It creates an unhealthy disregard even towards legitimate
authOrity and towards those deSirable regulations which are to be sacrosanct m the life of
a community.
Rules 1 through 5 are fairly straight-forward
The term .. narcotics" IS used In the sense of
forbidden .. d rug s .. like
herom,
LSD,
methednne etc The use of any narcotiCS
under medical superVISion as permitted by law
obViously cannot be prohibited Smce the term
.. narcotics" mcludes some drugs In medical
usage
Rule 6 says that female VISitors to the rooms
of the reSidents are not allowed to stay between
midnight (24 00 hrs) and 04 00 hours. An
analYSIS of It'S Implications and acceptability is
10 order here.
The present hostel rules do not allow girls
beyond the common-room at any time of the
day But as customs and boy-girl relatIOns
have changed over the years, It has become
routine for glrl-fnends and family members to
VISit guys In their rooms ThiS IS as It should
be, and With an un-usual display of good sense
the various Wardens have learnt to connive at
the mfrlOgement of so anachronistiC a regulation
But thiS can hardly be called a satisfactory
Many
state of 'affairs" (pun IrreSistible)
of us would prefer to stick to a declared
regulatIOn and not seek the obligation of the
authOrities In over looking any Violations
Some other students on the other hand, are
qUito comfortable With breaking these rules and
have no trOuble With their conscience

I• I•
Should there be any offiCial restrictions at
all on boy-girl relatIOnships" If yes, then
what should these be and why? If not, why
not?
Where does the freedom of an
indiVidual couple end and where does their
SOCial
responSibility start?
Who makes
these value-Judgments? Does the administration of a profeSSional Institute have the
TIght (or the duty) to lay down and enforce
personal morals In the lives of ItS students?
Does the age-group of the students affect
the answers to the above questions. and
If yes' how 7
What IS thiS nebulous entity called "SOCial
norms', and how do you Judge Its validity?
Do the institute authOrities have any legitimate
obligation to parents of students to enforce
certalO rules? To enforce religiOUS practices
or observances 7 To deCide the chOIce of
a career?
These are some of the questions which arise
when one sets out to make or mend rules on
a matter of as fundamental concern to Indlvld·
uals and to SOCiety as thiS matter definitely
IS OccaSionally these questions are rhetorrcal
In order to make a pomt.
ThiS IS the time to sweep these questions out
from under the rug where generatIOns of
squeamish parents and teachers have left them
to fester unresolved
Large numbers of us
may choose not to smoke, not to drink and
not to fool around pre-maritally or extra-maritally. We would choose these as personal
articles of faith to live by, and would want to
retain the TIght to reverse our deCISions at our
own sweet Will
No doubt we must also take
the IOevltable consequences of "Wrong" or
"bad" or,"second-best" chOIces, but we absolutely relfJse to have our optllOns fore-clos([d..
by the c().erclve diSCiplinary machinery manned
by an older generation, a generation of
teachers and parents, mostly born to a slave
nation, brought up In tradItion-bound orthodoxy, rarely competent to initiate or sustain
worthwhile SOCial changes, and above all,
deprived of genuine togetherness With the
opPosite sex throughout their dull, dreary
personal lives (as eVidenced by the dismal
desolation of their marital landscapes)

It IS the demand of the present set of young
people that their search for soul-mates and "femates be allowed to proceed unhmdered by
any of the traditional conSiderations of blInd
orthodoxy And what better way than to be
With friends and companions of both sexes, at
work at play, In a variety of spontaneous
settmgs 10 day-to-day life?
ThiS brings us to the obseSSion of the lawmakers With even the mere posslbl"ty of pre_
marital sex A generation whose first slgnlf,cant Intimate contact With a person of the
opposite sex came on the night of an arranged
fumblmg,
marriage,
With the confused,
bumbling proxlm,ty of a total stranger, can
perhaps be excused for a narrow view of
boy-girl relations The ban on the entry of
girls Into rooms of reSidents stems from thiS
baseless phobia:: that given the least bit of
pTlvacy the first thing that a young boy and
girl-will do IS to Jump Into bed:: what
humbug' , I

It IS the pTivilege of every teen-ager to have
the privacy of hiS room available to himself
and any friends of hiS chOice, atleast during
the daytime, whether at home or In a hostel
In post-graduate hostels some of the students
are already married, many are engaged to be
married and almost all the rest are Within
