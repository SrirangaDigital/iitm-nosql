Every year the standard question at the
begmnlng of the year IS How are the Freshers
yaar 1 I ThiS year It went unanswered thanks
to the combmed efforts of the authorities
(understandable) and the Steering Committee
(et tu, Brutes 1 I) Healthy Interaction was the
'm word (God knows what It'S supposed to
mean I I) The normal I I T Ian was rerdered
speechless by a rufe which loftily declared
'Abusive language reffectlng on parents and
relations (SIC I) shall not be used', Anyway,
undeterred by all these hurdles we set about
trying to talk to the freshers and spottmg the
talent In therr ranks To all those Jeremlahs
moaning about the lack of talent bedevlllmg
our cultural scene we would say only one thing'
Watch out for these youngsters They are good l
And we are sure we have uncovered only the
tiP of the Iceberg We apologise to all those
whom we were unable to meet due to vanous
reasons We are sure they understand
JOY ALOYSIUS THOMAS
What better way to commence a fresher's
feature than to talk to the brainiest of the lot 7
So we set out to rag-oops 'Interact' With Joy
who IS the J E E No 1 Appearance.wlse he IS
the standard prototype of a 'funda brain', besp.
ectacled and aloof It IS only when you talk
to him at length that you discover the range
and vanety of his mterests He has already
made It to the Institute qUIz team
Besides
he IS a fairly good debater Asked what he
thought of the new system he made a wry face
Intrepret It anyway you like I

ASHOK KUMAR
Badminton has always been a very popular
game In our Institute If the crowds at the
courts are any indication Badmrnton fans
might be glad to know that there eXists In
fresher ranks a player who Will defmltely be
In the top 5 Ashok not only has style and
power but IS also very consistent which IS
the hallmark of a class player We are sure
he Will render yeoman service to the Institute
m the years to come
AKBAR ALI
It was generally felt that the passmg out of
ace athletes like Chakl would deplete our
AthletiCS squad
The arnval of Akbar All

MURAU
The most eXCiting find of the season about
whom everybody IS raging IS no doubt Murall,
the basketball whiZ
He IS the only B Tech
