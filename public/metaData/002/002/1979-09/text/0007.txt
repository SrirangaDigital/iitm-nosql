SCENE
MY IMPRESSIONS
by Bharath Sethuraman
A few words on what has come to stay as
the 'Lit-Scene' would not, I thmk, be inappropriate In a campus mag like ours
The stress thIs yeaT would be on two Itemsdebatmg and creative writing
We, the
orgaOisers, are concerned about the complamts
we receive that debating has degenerated Into
plain speech-makmg and has lost depth completely As what we hope IS a corrective
measure, we are introducing thiS year group
debates at both the Inter-hostel and the
institute open levels. ThIS would, we feel,
have two Important Influences-

1.

shIft the emphaSIS from superfIcIalItIes like
accent and 'bIg words' to solId matter
and argumentative skills and

2

Involve a greater number of people lo the
debate The malO drawback IS organIsatIon-but that's our headche I We hope, If
time permIts, to hold non-competitive
debates on matters of topIcal Interest,
which should draw large audiences

The second Item, creative Writing, IS somethmg that has long been neglected at I I T It
feally lS a Pity, fOf wntmg IS such a baSIC skill
and yet we are whol/v defiCient 10 It The fact
that we are technically oriented people IS no
excuse whatsoever for our lack of mterest In
wlltmg ConsequentlY, wrltmg IS gOing to be
given a much needed fillip thiS year, and It IS
hoped that the response from prospective
writers would be good We would like to
pomt out that for the many IImongst us In I I TÂ·
who would like to take palt 10 some actIVity
somewhere but have 'stage fright', wntlng
offeTs a very convenient outlet I BIOS des,
most of us If I remember correctly, could write
fairly well when we Jomed f I.T - It IS not too
late now to resume our skills'

The smug look of a man who knows he IS
making a pile by conning a couple of thousand
up-and-comrng technologists-everyone of
the near half a dozen Kumar 's possesses It.
I'm referring to Cozy corner and the conmen
who run It We I I Tlans have no other resort
but to drink the apology of the concoction
affectionately referred to as tea ' and at times
coffee' No dlscernable dIfference between
the two actually! The writers' code prevents
me from usmg harsher but more apt terms to
refer to the eyesore that rests between Narmada
and Godavarr which caters to gentry from as
far as the holy Ganga to the not-so-holy workshop

It IS mdeed a sad commentary on the state of
affans rn I I T (M) WIth ItS vaunted boast of
excellent amenIties If It cannot prOVide Its
Inmates With a Simple cup of tea whIch does
not taste like rat pOison
We are made of
sterner stuff and have WIthstood the onslaught
on our gastric lining for more than a year now.
But the con men are never satiated They
tempt the gullible among us WIth rectangular

1r1~IIE

pieces of an orange hue (the baJjls 'I) How
much more can the system take? I r I WOUldn't
be surprIsed If the conmen come up With psnk
hexagonal stuff tomorrow They definitely are
capable of It, for from orange rectangles to pmk
hexagons IS but a step I
Assuming that everyday, 1,500 brave men
patronise the kiosk (and that's a low flguremind you, for they have 4 sales pomts on the
campus totally), their dally turnover IS bound
to be Rs 2000, to state a conservative fIgure.
And a monthly clean-up of Rs 60 000 for these
MafiOSI And they caVil that they are not
allowed to run the show durmg MardI Gras I
Let them do It once, lust once, and the anti
Mardi Gras school Will have a ball In fact, we
doubt If Mardi Gras would go through the full
5 days They don't have the baSIC decency
and hospitality to prOVide us With something to
rest our bottoms on, while partaking of their
cup of rat pOIson, for however stem we may be.
we fmd It Just that wee bit dIffIcult to take
things standmg up
Our mSldes are makrng
VOCIferous appeals to cry halt, not to mention
our extenors (the botto m, 10 particular I)
Promises of cafeteTlas have come and gone like
our central mtnlstfles Our new Duector has
got some excellent and more
Important
Concrete plans for one Let's hope he cames
them out expeditiously.

p S: At the tIme of gorng to Press we hear
the Director and the Dean of Students
vIsIted Cozy and tool< him to task for the
poor quality of hiS wares He has been
given an ultimatum - Improve or qUit I

DEVOTED, FILLED WITH INSPIRATION,
ARRIVED AT THIS GREAT INSTITUTION,

As the response to elocution last year was
very good, we shall be gomg ahead full steam
WIth It There IS talent 10 I I T. for thiS event,
also, It has audIence appeal.

HE 'TRIES TO GLEAN AS MUCH HE CAN
TO MAKE HIMSELF A FUNDA MAN
SOME LASSITUDE NOW DOES APPEAR

QUIZ retains ItS position as one of the most
popular events gOlOg In I I T thanks probably
to the insatiable appetite we have for
k now led g e of the extra-curncular kind 1
Similarly JAM and Guessword are Stl(( fairly
popular, and we shall contmue With all three
As for crosswords and vocab tests, I don't
thmk the I I T Ian Will ever tire of them 1
We have dropped certam events from the
institute level, for we felt that the standards
were dropprng rn them and that they are
prrmanly party-level games
Examples are
11Otoretto and 20 questions However, these
events are excellent at the Intra-hostel level
and need not necessanly be ' killed' outTlght.'

HIS IRON WILL TURNS WEAK, I FEAR
NO MORE ALL HOURS DOES HE ATTEND
BUT CUTS HIS CLASS HIS TIME TO SPENO
THE THIRD YEAR FINDS HIM QUITE EFFETE,

*

HE KNOWS NOUGHT BUT THAT HIS COG SHEET

*

WILL SEE HIM THROUGH HIS SOJOURN HERE
AND FETCH HIM JOBS-NOW AIN'T THAT QUEER?
SO ON THROUGH LIFE HE PLODS HIS WAY,
STOIC BLISSFUL, COME WHAT MAY
WITH TUTS, AND TESTS HE SELDOM QUAILS
THEY STAND BY HIM WHEN ALL ELSE FALLS
