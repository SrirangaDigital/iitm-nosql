We at 'Campastlmes' In the best lradltlons
of ente(prrSlng Journalism sat out to talk to the
students and listen to what they had to say
about the neW system. And Oh my God! did
The reactIOns were as
we get a earful"
diverse and IndIvidualistic as the students of
this campus But on one thing they were all
unanimous They were totally against the
evaluatl()n method of the new system On the
other hand, the system of credits and fleXibility
In chOOSing electives were widely welcomed
as a step In the fight direction We a$ked 4
baSIC questions and thesa were the reactIOns
we got:
Q. 1.

Have you fully understood the new
system?

Ans.:

An overwhelming majority professed
Ignorance about many facts of the new
system They felt inhibited to approach
the Dean to clear up theH doubts.
BeSides, their lecturers (as usual I)
were In blissful Ignorance of what was
happening Hence we could unwittingly
establish
a serrous communication
gap between the students and the
authOrities.

Most of the students felt apprehensive
about their performance In the new
system While It was agreed that
toppers would contlhUe to tOp, the
others appeared to be gloomy about
what the future held for them Most of
them felt that much would depend on
the lecturers srnce the new system
grants them total fleXibility. In fact
many students feared that arbitrary
lecturers would play havoc With their
grades ThiS they felt was one of the
major flaws of the system
Many

have to start sucking up to thtJ lecturers,
a thing they had never bothered to do
In the past

00 you feel that the scope of taking
part In extra-curricular actiVities Will be
restricted?

AfI$,;

An overwhelmll'lg maJorrty concurred on
the fact that they would not be able to
devote any tllne to extra.currrcular
actiVities As most of them put It 'It
would be SUICidal on our part to Indulge
In all thiS, while most of our compatrrots
would be slogging away' The new
, profile' system was dismissed off as
, Merely taking part IS one thmg Excellmg IS a totally different matter It

P S.: At the time of gOing to Press we
hear that as far as the grading aspect IS concerned we are gOlOg back to the old system
We hope thiS IS not a temporary thlOg but

We feel that eventually it will become
necessary to leave the reSidents absolutely free
to do as they please, day or night. so long as
they don't create public problems,
