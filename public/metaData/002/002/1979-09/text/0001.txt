taperecorder, a camera and a wIde vanety of
queries and set off for the fifth floor
Not
to Jump off from there as often happens, but to
intervIew our Director. We were JustIfIably a
b,t nervous and apprehensIve, But our fears
were III-founded as we soon dIscovered The
Director, simply dressed and leaning back In
his chaIr, welcomed us with a refreshing
candour and warmth, seldom found In Ad
Bleck Rapport was soon established and
taperecorder SWitched on The Photography
EdItor hovered rn the background looking for
the rIght angles.

H,s profound understandrng; of studen

DIR ' The new system has been Introduced
because of my conVIctIons that It IS gomg to
help the students academ,cally and also help
them to make chOIces of the IT Ilkmg
It
has got very lIttle to do with the fact that It
has been Introduced and followed elsewhere.
The most Important thmg IS that It IS
a more reasonable and a more eft,c,ent
system of educatIon than a f,xed one where
