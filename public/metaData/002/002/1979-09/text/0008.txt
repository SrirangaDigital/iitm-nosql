FRESHERS!

by 0 .Hi 60d
Hello, Freshers 1 Congrats for having chosen
to study In this temple of learning. Of course,
on your first VISit to this campus, you must
have congratulated yourself a thousand times
Congrats again (for thinking like every other
sucker I)
What you have seen IS an illusion
After your five years In this mstltute you will
have learnt a lot about life and very little about
your dIsCipline

p, S:

ThiS IS an apt word to describe
the Jomt where you replenish your
energy Whether you really do so
IS the billion dollar question lOne
thmg you must never do IS to step
lOS Ide the kitchen You won't be
the same man agam It IS pure
legalised fleecmg With you dear
fresher being the dumb sheep J
Anyway, learn to glln and bear It,
Many believe that It IS part of the
system which makes sure you
develope endurance and tenacity,
qualities every I I T Ian should
possess I
More of thiS If I am still around I

Allow me to describe some of the speCies
you mayor may not come across Whether
this IS a rule or an exception, decide for yourself.

entry to hand to playa spade hopmg that west
has A, Q bare In the SUIt, he can kill the other
entry to hand destroymg any POSSibility of a
squeeze HaVing deCided to preserve the
entrtes on hand, I Win the fIrst tnck In dummy
With a king. East follOWing With the SIX and
call for a small spade I I East plays low
(naturallY-It would have been a defence from
the fourth dimenSion to play the Queen from
aX) and , the ten
West goes Into a long
trance before winning With the Ace and then
shoots back the ten of hearts, which I wtn
With my queen. Now I find that the entry to
squeeze East In hearts and cfubs has been
knocked out However, all IS not lost yet I
play straight to the king and East obligingly
produces the queen
Now I know that I surely
have them -since West did not lead diamonds
oTlglnally, he has utmost one of the missing
honours In the SUIt and East who would be
busy protecting hearts and cfubs would not be
able to gaurd hiS partner from a fmesse In
diamonds. So I continue to reel off the
spades watchmg the discards carefully. Since
the hand IS almost double dummy at thiS stage,
I will gIve all the four hands.

thought he were praYing to Godregular but his mind IS wandenng
Into the realms of a subject which
IS easier for him to comprehend

You are sure to see this guy at
least twice In a year-the Inaugral
and hostel day He works with a
real detached feeling-and he puts

a creature of this species comes
to the hostel to take home a
couple of things but at such times
he appears blacker than Blackbeard's Ghost]

If

you ever get an opportunity to
enter this heaventy abode (no
pun mtended I) as an in-patient,
do not forget to carry along with
you a copy of 'Cancer Ward'.
Reading It will help 11ft your
dejected SPirits Hope that you
are good at diagnOSing your own
malady
Probability that the
doctor Will make a wrong diagnosIs IS fast converging to one
There have been many Instances
when the patient got cured (by
nature) and left the doctors
puzzled

If you ever lo~e your bike report
the loss and forget about It
Their main function In recent
times has been to prevent those
bad wicked seniors from getting
at you freshers I If some burglars
do manage to get at your things
well, It IS your tough luck, yo~
can't blame them I You may be
flattered to know that It IS you
not your possessIOns which get

Ad. Block;

ThiS IS the place where the
Director and hiS Deans decide our
fates I But more Important than
these deCISion makers are the
numerous clerks out there They
are always shoo-Ing you out of
Ad block and asking you to
return later (to be shoo-ed
again I)
A couple of nice people
stili work there (You will take a
long time finding them)

Playmg a crucial match, 10 a big pnze money
invitational tournament, against good opponents, I pick up as the dealer S 10,5
H AQJ 73, D J 10,5,3; C A,5
I fmd my
partner stili brooding over the slam he had
gone down m the prevIous deal when I opened
the bid WIth ONE HEART. West PASSES.
My partner comes back to the present With a
startled ' What happened?" and then after a
btlef glance at hiS cards, surprises me With a
bid of FIVE HEARTS East PASSES
With my
good trumps, my action IS straight forward and
I bid SIX HEARTS Now, a kibitzer at my
partner's Side, who had been restless dUllng
the bIdding heSitantly pam,s out that my
partner IS bidding With the hand belonging to
the prevIous deal There IS a lot of confUSIOn
around the table and the tournament director IS
called
He gives the ruling that the bidding
continues as It IS My partner ap%glses
repeatedly as he picks up hiS correct cards and
after a long trance, bide SIX SPADES
East
PASSES Not wantmg to let my partner play
m hiS confused state, / bid SIX NO TRUMPS.
My partner looks relieved
To my great
surprise, thiS IS passed all round and I find
myself
In
SIX no trumps after thiS unique
action
West leads the CLUB E/GHT and my partner
apologlses once more as he spreads the dummy.
So I see.

On the last spade East shakes hiS head and
discards the dIamond king and I the fIVe. Now
I cross to the club ace, discard the club seven
on the Heart ace and lead the Jack of diamonds
and pass It when West plays low and claims the
contract. The four hands were :-

Post Mortem
The handling of the spade SUit was a very
effective deception which few people have the
guts to try.

I find that, even assummg that the heaTt
fmesse IS light and I somehow manage to get
five tricks In spades. we have only eleven
However,' find that East can certainly
t(leks
be squeezed In hearts and clubs. (By Inference,
he has J 10 9 X of clubs and he hoped to
hold the hearts king) But If I USe up one

One word of caution - We should try the
deception only when for some reason you don't
want to play the SUit from the South's hand
and also for obVIOUS reasons, the hand weaker
In honour strength should be the closed hand.
In the gaurd squeeze, note that the ace of
hearts should not be cashed earlier m play
(Try It) To Identify a gaurd squeeze, look tor
the follOWing ;Whenever all the conditions for a Simple
squeeze are satisfied except the entry, look to
a fmesslng POSition against the squeeze's
partner In a third SUit
