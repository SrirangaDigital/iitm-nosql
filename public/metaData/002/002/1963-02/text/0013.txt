to him. That \Vili be pooe service to the

Studenl Indiscipline
After that, T. S . Allant"" asked Dr. Doshmukh what steps students could take to
eradicate indiscipline.
'You ought to be good,' he said. I Some
students wiU be inclined to do some mischief,
but with most students against thern, they
will find it diffieult.'
When Allantlm said that bad students
generally predominated, Dr. Deshmuhh dis·
agreed and said, • No, if you take 100 students, you wiU find 5 or 6 ring-leaders who
lead some kind of unlawful movement'.
• Even if that be so,' said Ananthu,' it is
not possible to stop thern, because good
students are generally timid' .
Thc Vice-Chance(lor vehemently disagreed
with this statement. This led to a very
interesting dialogue between the two, the
Vice-CJzarlcelior finally emerging clearly victorious. He ended up by saying: I lt is possible to stop bad students, if you have the
courage, but you do not have the courage,
because you say, " Well, supposing I am
harassec;l at the bus stop, or somebody sits
in Satyagraha outside my door!" In the
name of either students' solidarity or merely
because you are too timi d, you haven't got
the eourage to say, I l Get away, I am going to
do what is right in the circurnstances, and
you are not going to deflect me by your
tbreats and your harassments." Ultimately,
if you analyse student trouble, it is always
diseovered that this \Vas led by a few people
who are finally given some punishment and
they are suspended or they are expelled and the
rest of the students remain wbere tbey are.
They either apologise and they are forgiven
or they have to put in additional work and so
ono Now, I do not see why students who do
not agree with these ring-leaders, cannot
stand up against them.' Finally, he looked
at Allalltllll and added, I H, as you say, most
of the good studeots are timid, the future of
the nation is doomed. What ean timid
stuclents do for the future of the country' ?
The Assistant Editor had no answer and
preferred to proceed to the next question:
I Sir, whenever we go for a job
and we say
that we have a degree in England, we are
considered superior to those who have
degrees here. Do you think ,his is a healthy
tendeney I '
.
Dr. Deshmukh said that he was sorry such
tendencies were creeping into society. He
himself h.d studied abro.d, but had not been
affeeted by such wrong ideas.
, I belong to that body of students whieh
50 years ago or 45 years ago went far their
education abroad: he said. 'I passed my
Intermediate and then went to Cambridge. I
took my degree there. l do not hold any
Indian degree. I took classe.s in National
Science in Cambridge and also competed for
the Indian Civil St!rviee, but in those days
you could notocompete for it in tbis country.
That was 19[8, so I had no option in any
case, but I am, on the other hand, also aware
of many students who have gane abroad no~
being able to find a job here. It is for this
purpose of accommodating them that the
Ministry of Scientifie Researeh and Cultural
Affairs have started the system of pool offiee,
that is to say, a pool of these students who
have returned from abroad and who cannot be
fitted into any kind of job whieh is suitable
far them, to give them a !ittle breathing time
and also to ensure that in the meantime they
are able to follow whatever speciality they
have cultivated in the hope that in abaut two
or three years' time they may find it possible
to get fì.tted somewhere either in the academic
line or in some atber line.'
At the end of the half-honr interview,
Editor Analld Singh Bawa thanked the ViceClzallcellor for the friendly and interesting talk
he gave them in spite of his severai important
engagements.

He said he had once been a member of the
Board of Governors of this Institute and had
visite~ the Institute once. I You have a very
beautiful Campus with a very impressive lake
behind your hostel " he remarked.
, Dnring which season did you go there?'
asked Vihram Rao.
, In Oetober. Why l'
I It \Vas a lake then.
It is no longer a lake
now,' quipped our Assistallt Editor.
All four burst into laughter and they
parted 00 this humorous note.
'

'AH right', (along with " I up to',
, up tiU '-these are separate words
and .·hall not be used as alle word.
(' Inasmuch' is one word and shall not be
separated).
3. 'Pereent ', 'Subcommitted ''':''''these
wards are to be used as single wordt.
4. Incorreçt expressions : Certain expressions are ineorrect or redundant
or inelegant for use in standards and
should be rep laeed by correet forms.

Examples:
Gobblledegook-(Continued)
~1. I Thanking you "
'vVith regards "
• Wlth best wishes '-these are the frequent
phrases used at the end of some of the letters.
Many may be surprised to note that these are
not sentences by themselves and as such incomplett! and grammatically ineorrect too. The
word I l remain " 'We remain', I I am' or
I We are' are too invariably, to, f0110w these
,~ords (after a comma) before thc subseriphon. Thus, it is correct to say Thanking
you, I remain, Yours faithful1y, etc.', and
Yours
meorrect to say, I Thanking you
faithfully, etc.'

that they are incomprehensible leave alone
their grammatical inaecuracy. As a specimen,

clrcular letter: 'Although, being equal1y

appropriate, I would like to extend an invitation to all . . . . . '.
