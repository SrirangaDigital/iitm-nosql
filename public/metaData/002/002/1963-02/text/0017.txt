Lord Macaulay once declared that the finest
compliment paid to his writing \Vas byone
who said that no sentence in thc great
HistOTY oJ ElIglalld needed far its understanding a second reading. The I.I.T. correspondents wiU please note this, and see that
their writings do not require a re~reading to
knoW' what they convey, to find aut the
sententia behind them. The contcnts of the
correspondenee should be crisp, lucid and
dear; it should be, as somebody put it, like
a lady's skirt, short enough to attract, hut
long enougb to cover the subject matter.
I hope the official. at all leve!s will give
the correspondenee a better look with mare
grammatieaIly correct sentences. The stenographers and typists should not be mere
copyists, meehanically typing aut whatever
the offieials write, but should be good correspondents, too, and type thc drafts given thero
1Il11tatis l1mta1ldis, of course, only when there
need be. If the typists and the stenographers
say ' It was so there in the draft', when an
apparent crror is pointed aut, I am sorry to
say, they are unfit to hold the posts thcy have
been in .
