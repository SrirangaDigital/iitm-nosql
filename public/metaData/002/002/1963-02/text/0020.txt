I.l. T. Literary Activities
January has been a busy month for the
Literary Activities Committee. In the weck
beginning from ]anuary 23. we had no less
than five competitions-four of them intercollegiate.
00 Wednesday, January 23, thc Institute
Annual Graup Discussion Competition was
held. The III Year Team discussed ' Censorship is an unavoidable roeasure in any
civilized society' and \Vas declared first. A
we1come fcature was thc strong IV Year Team
which stood a dose secondo Thc Institute
team was selectcd for thc Inter-Collegiate
Group Discussion, R. Venkateswaran, S .
Nageshwar, V. Siddhartha, T. S. Ananthu and
R. A . Vaswani \Vere chosen to represent thc
Institute.
The Inter-ColIegiate Debate on Republic
Day morning was to have been an AB-India
debate, but due to thc national emergeney it
was deeided to restriet it to Madras on1y.
Six eolleges-Guindy Engineering College,
Madras Christian College, Loyola College,
Paehaiyappa's College, Queen Mary's College
and the LLT. participated. The subject
before the house was 'The seeret of happiness lies in liking what one does and not in
doing what one likes'. The I.I.T. team
consisting of T. S. Ananthu and R. A. Vaswani
walked away with the Institute Trophy. T.
S. Ananthu was declared best speaker and
Miss Mridula Rao of Queen Mary's College
was placed secondo Prof. R. Krishnamurthi
conducted the day's procecdings in a most
effieient manner.
In the Tnter-Collegiate German Recitation
Competition for the trophy awarded by Dr.
N. Klein, no outside colleges sent anyentries.
We had expected at least the Max-MullerBhavan would be represented. On the home
front, R. Venkateswaran was the winner with
C. V. Sahasranaman in second pIace.
The response for the Quiz and Group
Discussion was unexpectedly poor. Guindy
Engineering College, Pachaiyappa's College,
Queen Mary's College and the I.LT. were
the only four tearns present to compete for
the Quiz 'l'rophy donated by Shri R. Natarajan. Guindy Engineering College was placed
first with M .A. Retldy and V. Chandran in
fust and second p0sitions respectively.
In the Inter-Collegiate Group Discussion
we had onIy two guest teams.-Loyola
College and Guindy Engineering College. It
was the I.I.T. Team, however, who again
walked away with thc honours.
In retrospect I must say that we not only
expected more guest tcams, but that we also
had entries from many teams whç. just did
not turn up at thc last minute. Many colleges
put forth the piea that the third term is too
crowded with activities of their own and.
therefore, they are reluctant to send out
teams. It has been suggested that the events
be held sometime in September-October li a
better response is desired. Well, we have
noted this point, and I sincerely hope that
next year we wiU see many more teams in a11
the four events.
R.A.V.

turned in his grave. Mr. Sundaram who
has given performances of complete Shakespearian plays frequently lapsed into the
usage of 'spoke' instead of ' spake' and
, have' instead af I hath I. His vast knowledge was but at the bottom rung or the
ladder when, explaining the story of the
Mercharzt 0/ Venice, he remarked that
Mahatma Gandhi influenced Bassanio. He,
however. succeeded in climbing much further
up this ladder. Indeed, he was speaking the
truth when he said, ' . . . and then Shakespeare became my victim.'

SQUARE-DANCE No. 4

His rendering of Othello was quite good.
However, one carne away with the impression
that Desdemona could not have been slain.
Much to the discornfort of the audience
(having come late was bad enough) he
cmbarked on a discourse of how ane should
commit passages to memory. What the
method of teaching in present day schools is
and how the teaching of English could be
improved. Why Tamil should not be spoken
in an English dassroom and the rcason why
four students should read a poem instead of
forty. And aH along he was self-convinced
that part of his audience \Vas studying P.V .C.
and, therefore, \Vas in the category of reading
English novels which have the heading 'Dook
for Students studying English and having a
Vocabulary af 3000 words.'
Flute without Flute-the Natiollal Authe",
was murdered just as Macbeth murdered
the King.
On the whole the evening though entertaining and interesting in parts, carne to a
dose with a feeling of relief.

DRAMA REV/EW
By OUR DRAMATIC CRITIC
The play Adventure oJ /he Mazari" Stone
(Arthur Conan Doyle dramatized by Mr C.
Krishn~) \Vas enacted at the open-air theatre
on the 26th January. Owing to thc absenceof a
curtain, the settings for the orre act play were on
view long before the play began. Directed by
C. Krishna, it was not an unqualified successo
Mr. Siddhartha said his lines confidently and
naturally-although the same could scarcely be
said of the others-what he lacked in memory
he made up in acting. Mr. Nageshwar as
Watson was too stiff and unnatural. A Watson
who twiddles bis thumhs, twitches his upper
lip and shakes. bis head iIi a distressed manner
at the Count's ranting is scarcely compatible
with the genuine articIe. Mr Vaswani as the
Count was not bado Although he too fell a
prey to the generai defect of staying blank
and idle while someone else was saying his
lines. For example, he seemed entirely unimpressed by the fact that the jewel had been
snatched from hiro and that his arrest was
imminent. Not a vestige of fear, chagrin in
bafRement \Vas seen on his ·face. Mr Bukht
as Lord Cantelmere acted quite well as a
haughty and over-bearing member of the
aristocracy. Mr Menan as Sam Merton, the
Strong-Arm man affeeted a Yankee accerrt
instead of a Cockney ane. Mr Loomba acted
Billy the page.

'MY DEAR FOOL, COME HERE'

It was no less a person than the Hon.
Dr. Sastry, Vice-Chancellor of tbe Andhra
Vniversity, who told Mr. Sundaram, 'My
dear FooI, come here ! ! l'
Mr. N. Sundaram, the renowned monoactor, gave the LI.T. a sample of his brilliant talents on January 21St in the newly
constructed Metallurgy Workshop B1ock.
The evening's programme consisted of pieces
from Shakespeare's Tlze Merchant 0/ Venice,
Julills Caesar, O/hello and Macbelh and
Abraham Lillcoln's Speech at Gettysburg, a
rendering of the Natiotlal Anthem On The
Flute Without A Flute and some of hisMr. Sundaram's--expericnces on the stage.
To say the least, Shakespeare would have
