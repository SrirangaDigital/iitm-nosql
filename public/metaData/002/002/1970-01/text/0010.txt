With a tally 55 points greater than that of their nearest rival, KGP
can jUstifiably boast of a talented and successful athletics team. But it
can be seen that the points were mainly earned on the track where KGP
had at least two places in every race except 100 m. Despite the fact
that DLI and MDS came at the bottom of the table, the excellence of
freshman Daljit (DLI) and Kumar (MDS) in field events was proved
beyond doubt and their record-breaking performances were highlights
of the meet.
.
The individual championship went to Richard D'Souza (21 points),
who is probably the best runner any llT will ever see. Daljit Singh,
runner up with II) points, smashed records in shot-put, hammer throw,
discus and was the only member of. an otherwise frustrated DLI contingent to meet with a measure of success. Narendra Kumar, third
with 16 points. was very unfortunate in his choice of events to be con~
sidered for the championship. With every chance-of remedying this
next year, J:1e is an asset to the MDS team.

When KNP were putting up a feeble resistance against MDS in
the doubles in the tennis semi~final the forlorn cries of • Keep it up
KNP' were silenced by one realist' Don't be sarcastic yar!
The fun and games that have been crammed into the last four days
(more of the former, we hope) were enough to e:('haust every one of
the wish to prolong the leave~taking." We have enjoyed hosting the
meet and having all of you staying anti c.Qtnpeting with us. We hQpe
you have enjoyed it as much as we have.
Here's wishing you all the best, bon voyage and good hunting.
