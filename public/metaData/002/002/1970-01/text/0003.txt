THE
FAREWELL
TEA PARTY
IN keeping with the

best Gymkhana traditions of teas, high teas and mad tea parties,
a • farewell tea' was organised to mark the
sending off of the Madras Contingent to the
KGP Meet. Dr A. Ramachandran was the
chief guest; the other people invited to send
off OUT sportsmen were Dr Klein (for obvious
reasons), Prof Sampath (who didn't turn up),
Prof Sethunathan (who is indispensable),
and Dr Taqui Khan (who, as actipg warden
of Godavan Hostel, had the responsibility
of conducting.the mess for the Inter IIT guys).
The General Secretary started off the proceedings as usual by making a pretty little
speech profusely thanking everyone for everything, declaring that Chillar was confident
we wouldn't retain the honoured fifth place,
and then handing over the torch to C.hillar.
The Sports Secretary (and Captain of the
contingent) said his bit about our prospects:
that in tennis and badminton we should make
our mark, that basketball was historically our
strong point, and that we hoped for • breakthroughs' in volleyball, football and hockey.
All of which meant we were aiming for something more than our usual share of points and
honours,
Dr Klein, in his inimitable style, observed
that he would be sending us off at Madras
Central in a couple of days, and then overdoing
the whole thing by hopping over to Kharagpur
in time to welcome us there. He had, it was
disclosed. very wisely booked his journey by a
cons~derably faster train. Unlike the speakers
before him, he had a few misgivings ••• for
he asked, all innocence, if anyone else shared
Chillar's enthusiasm and confidence about our
forecast eviction from the time immemorial
fifth place. Ho\vever. he didn't elaborate on
whatever impression he may have gathered
from his disconcerting fact-finding tours round
the campus during the training period; anyhow, he was outvoiced that evening by the
members of the contingent who seemed to be
a sight surer of themselves than others were.
Boy, were they confident of making thejr
• breakthroughs' and holding their own in
the games traditionally their forte I

The Director, taking his cue, came
back with the remark that we couldn't
possibly go lower: and that meant the
only place we could go was up. All this,
he confided, was because the people at Delhi
had no plans at present for a sixth nT.
Taking a leaf out of the book of once·upon-atime raggers, he hit upon the idea of making
each member of the contingent announce his
llame and his game: in short, to ' introduce
himself'. This kept us occupied for some
time. The two supernumeraries, when they
announced themselves, drew some laughs-the
Campastimes • observer' and the General
Secretary, who were • just going along with
the team'. The Director wished us luck,
indeed, everyone seemed to be wishing us
luck that evening.
Having demolished the fare provided, the
contingent saw the guests off •.. and returned
half an hour later for dinner. There's nothing
like a good appetite to keep one going. •

in a position to overtake MDS who had a total
of 34, while KNP with 20, couldn't. If
BMB took the second place in athletics, the
only chance for MDS was to take the third
place in athletics to maintain their overall
second place.
The first relay (4X 100 metres) brought a
surprise: first were BMB with a recordsmashing timing of 45.3 sees. MD6 were
nowhere on the scene. We didn't have any
illusions as to our chances in the other relay:
we were running with a makeshift team (the
Godavari Hostel relay team, as somebody
quipped) and with BMB, KGP and KNP
running as they were, we didn't make the mistake of even hoping for a miracle. If BMB
did it again in the 4X400 metres relay, they
would walk away with the runners-up position
in the general championship.
Our cheerleaders, furiously calculating and
arguing, were in a frenzy of last-minute
figuring-out. :; Should BMB win, should KNP
win, should '-KGP win? Which would turn
out to be better for us? Someone authoritatively claimed that our best bet would Jje KNP
beating BMB in the last relay. Away we
swarmed ~ onto the field, cheering our heads
off-for:-'KNP. Come on, KNP 1 Faster
Kanpur I Come on Aneja I Come on
Trivedi! Kanpur were mighty surprised at
this highly vocal and enthusiastic support
from Madras. But they didn't have time to
be suspicious: the race was on, and our noisy
encouragement rent the sky. BMB were
running strongly, crowding KGP, the leaders.
KNP were running like blue blazes, too.
Everyone was running, spectators, competitors" and all. KGP finished first, and KNP,
running for themselves and for MDS, finished
second. BMB's hopes went up in smoke
as they took ~he third place. Three cheers
for Kanpur:... Hip, hip, . . • • Hurray !
Three cheers for the Aneja Brothers •..•
Hip, hip, •. , Hurray I For they are jolly
good fellows.... Thanks a lot, Kanpur ,
thanks for everything I MD6 were jubilant.
Someone started explaining that the calculations were all wrong, that MDS would
have come second even if KNP hadn't beaten
BMB in the last race. but nobody was listening.
Who cares I We came second. didn't we?
Kanpur were great guys, anyway. Three
cheers for them again I
Officials were asking us to fall in fol' the
march past. We were still milling round,
congratulating ourselves, making much of our
heroes, releasing all the excitements and ten•
sions of the past four days.

We did it •..• etc.-CcO/ttd. from p. I)
Before the two relays (4 X 100 metres and
4 X 400 metres) each of which carried 10 points
for the first position, 6 for the second, and 2
for the third, the positions were: KGP 73,
MDS 3°.5, DLI 27.5, KNP 26 and BMB 19.
KGP were sure to take the first place regardless of the results of the relays: and they had
a very good chance in the relays too. Our
position for the. general championship depended entirely on which IIT took the second
place in athletics, for this carried with it 12
points. BMB, with a total of 25 so far, were
