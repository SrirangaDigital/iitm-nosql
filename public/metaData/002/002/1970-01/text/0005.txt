We are aware of the fact that the people
at the Gymkhana have the gift of doing

a great deal of wrangling and
bickering, our Gymkhana came through
with track suits for the athletics team. This, in
itself, wasn't a bad thing; but like everything
else the Gymkhana does, providing the ' track
suits' was only a part of the story. Half the
athletics team found it impossible to get into
their suits, and the half that could looked uncommonly like scarecrows in them. The
spectacle of our brave track-&-field men in
sack-like costumes several sizes too small for
them, made Some laugh and some bite theirlips.
It was thoughtful of the tailor who made
these suits to have left out the lettering

which lIT these walking advertisements
represented, but a little common sense
would have singled out Madras as the only
lIT which does things by such sorry halves.

just about everything wrong, but this
time, the joker. responsible has been particularly brilliant. So much for those ·who got
the • track suits'; how about those who
didn't? The basketball team, especially. who
had to play their matches early at night,
needed them badly. Night, in the Kharagpur
willter, isn't warm by any means, and Kanpur
and Delhi will be a sight worse. The Kharagpur teams, who stood out as examples both as
regards their performance and the equipment
they were provided, seemed to find no shortage
of track suits. It is very easy to find reasons
why our teams cannot be provided with what
they need; it willlle more useful, however, if
the authorities went round trying to find
solutions to these problems instead.

wouldn't have made any difference anyway,
but that's not the point.

The type of cynical wisdom which makes a
horse-laugh of endeavour seems to have been
confined to lIT Madras, the Lord be thanked,
and the Meet proceeded in a spirit of keen
competition. That is, as keen a competition
as four-and-a-half IlT's could make it.

Anyone who followed the athletics events
through the four days of the Meet couldn't
but have noticed the number of athletes from
lIT Madras who were entered for the various
events but who failed to show up. We took
a rather nwnerous athletics team along to
KGP, but for all the good they were, we might
have taken Narendra Kumar and a couple of
others along and left it at that. This is not
saying that our participants were totally unsuccessful. It is just that, after having
travelled a thousand and odd miles for the
express purpose of taking part in an event or
two, quite a few decided not to take part after
all. Doubtless they had their reasons for
