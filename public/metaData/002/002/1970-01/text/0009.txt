KOP
Kharagpur is a ~me-horse town with IlT and
little else of which to boast. Railway lines
here with a few dingy dwellings in between,
and more railway lines there with a few more
hu.ts in between, and right over there still more
railway lines with a sprawling station thrown
in for kicks" " " that about sums up KGP.
The air is hC'avy with coal dust and smoke, and
a mist clouds the atmosphere from early in the
eveni~g till late morning. Daylight hours
are short .~jld by six it is quite dark.
The Campus is large: it covers about 1140
or thereabouts, and even though there is
no clear boundary between the Campus and
the town, one can make out very precisely
where the town ends and the Cronpus begins
by the comparative neatness and modernity
of the buildings and the surroundings. The
Institute itself is walled off and fronted by an
impressive building: the IIT tower, a part of
this building, is the tallest structure in,
Kharagpilr. The rest of the Campus is
neatly laid out on a circular pattern in park-like
surroundings, with refreshing variations in the
architecture of the buildings, especially the
hostels.
'fh,eJ:"e is a large, well-equipped, and efficient
hospital. Going thr~ugh the ~ospital buil:I~
ing,,· we were surprIsed by Its extent, lts
xiume{ous staff, the facilities available and its
obvious impot"tance in the scheme of things
in the Campus. We blushed to think of our
apology for a hospital at Madras and th.e paleo~
lithic medical facilities our Campus had to
off~r. The Swimming Pool at Kharagpur
."..a~ jI, big joke for a long time, we were told.
But a joke it is no longer. Now it is finished,
and fabulous is about the only word to convey
our jmpression of it. When, oh when, will
we see such a sight in lIT Madras? We are

a~res

1970
of a remarkably sanguine disposition, but
even a Micawber would find it difficult to
keep up his expectations in the face of the
progt"ess Ollr swimming pool is so visibly
making.
One building which has no counterpart in
our Campus is the Students' Centre. It has
an indoor badminton court and houses a
canteen, gymnastics equipment, gymkhana
offices, etc. We looked wistfully at the striking building and decided its high time Daddy
got us something of the sort. But will Daddy?
No dough, that's his complaint.
The Netaji Subhas Ch.andra Bose Audi~
torium, where the cultural progt"ammes were
held, looked the ideal halfway house between
the CLT and the OAT. On the day of our
arrival at KGP, a movie was screened at the
auditorium.
At KGP, there are no hostels ••. instead,
they have Ilalls of reSidetlce. Grandiose as
this may sound, wp can say confidently that
one of our hostels, say Kaveri, can aspire to
the title with equal justification. Our hostels
may be a little' colourless perhaps, but as to
making people miserable, they are about as
effective as their KGP counterparts.
The Jnan Ghosh Stadium is a little larger
than ours, and has the distinct advantage
of 110t being of the singing variety. It proved
adequate for the demands made of it.
There is a lot more to the Campus , .. staff
quartl.'l"s, play fields, Institute buildings ...
and places, perhaps, of whose existence we are
still unaware. But nowhere did we find a
Gajendra Circle: we suppose we didn't look
hard enough. We left with the feeling that
there }'I'2S a great deal of exploring we hadn't '
yet done.
