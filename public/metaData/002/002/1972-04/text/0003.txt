THE CONTINUING DIALOGUE
The Director talks to
Campasti mes :
The battle of Waerloo' we are told' was
won on the p\aY111g ficld~ of Eton and Harrow'
If the battle for peace and fnendshlp between
the students and the staff tn Indian
Unwer~ltles IS ever fought and won, It WIIi
be won first 111 the lIT, for In the person of
It<; DIrector Dr A. Ramach.wdran the
Institute has the epitome of fr.lnknes> and
frlendltness, the type the students the world
over want to have as their fnend, philosopher
and gUIde, and the \ery antHhe~ls ot established authortty. Time spent with hIm
setmed time spent III creatlllg a greater
rapproachement a part of a contlllulllg dlJlogue
of understanding. Views were expressed on
almost all IJIatters that Interest us, and what
touched one's vanity was the Interest shown
In one's views (What do you feel about It ?)
It showed a destre to understand more than
to direct

Campastmus had gone to find out hIS
ImpressIOns of the Amencan tour and he was
fast and systemattc 111 hiS answers. We quote
excerpts of the 111tervlew leaVIng the arrangement to you for you Will find out that they
were arranged even they came out.
"I met a lot of liT students fIght from
New York to Los Angeles. They have a umformly high reputatIOn and their faculty are
.all praise for them Students from the IITs
are given preference over their counterparts
111 other IndIan Umversltles.
Another surpnslIlg thmg IS that nearly
80 %of them want to come back. MahaJan,
for example You may not know him. When
1 talked to him, he was very keen on commg
back. He had already come once to India to
study the market He wants to set up his
own consulting firm
Some of them take up Jobs for 2 or 3 years
so that they can pay for thelr passage. When
I tOld the Deans there about thiS, there was a
better understandmg of thelr posltton.
There has been a drastIc cut m the funds
for research. Defence and space programmes
have been cut. The result IS that assistantshipS
are not forthcomlllg ThiS :.ltuatJOn IS hkely
to contmue for at least two more years. At
M.I T. the Dean told me that at the Asst.
Professor level there has b~en no recrUItment
for the past 2 years But only tf fresh blood
IS mfused 'WIll there be more mtaltty.

In the 60's there was a great emprasis on
Engmeermg sCiences nOw the emphaSIS IS on
Englneermg deSign and development. EnvIronmental problems are recelVmg a lot of
attentlon Very stnngent regulations have to
be comphed with even to sIte a thermal power
station.
Systems engmeenng has been developmg
..ery rapidly and IS getting lots of Federal
grants. ThiS means an Integrated approach
to a problem Urban engtneenng, tlansport
and commumcatlon problems are bemg taken
up very senously. People come only to
work m the centre of the City but have their
houses III the suburbs. So rapid transit
systems are developmg very fast. You see
how you need an mtegrated approach to solve
your pollutIon problems, your urban problem,
your transport problems.

I would like to mention the CO-OP system,
somethmg like the sandWich system here. In
a number of unIversities, upto 10% of the
students have opted for It. The student
-spends alternate periOds m mdustry and m
the class. So the students are better motlvat-ed and fit III better after graduation. They

arc also setttng up Industnal Research Palks
In the \ IClIIlty of rhe campus for; oOphlstlcated
Instruments and devlce~, lhe faculty acttng
a~ consultants Often here, thlre I~ no contact
between tndustry and the Umver~ltles. Why
are we havmg semmars here? The purpose
l~ for people from IIIdustry to come and meet
the faculty and try to see If they can work
together 0\1 problems of relevance 11l Indian
mdustnes.
Tn several of the UnIVerSIties, research
programmes on the transfel of technology to
devdoptng countnes IS gOlIlg on. In the
Umverslty of Cabforma, I saw a theSIS on the
condition of Madras city tn the year 2000 An.
I \Vas told that graduate students had come
here and analysed the problems, the amount
of power, housmg, and so on reqUIred.
Similar work has been done on Bombay
and Calcutta also.
There are educatlonal development centres
III many UmverSltles for Improvmg SCience
EducatIOn III schools and cfll\eges. Table
top expts. teachmg aids. etc. Tb.ere are also
the ASSOCIate degree mStItutlons, SimIlar to
the EngIneenng Grade schools In Germany.
There are 2 to 4 year courses where engtneerIIIg students are trahung.
Some people feel that there are too many
Ph Ds. The glut IS partly due to the cut back
space programmes. There IS even some
unemployment of Doctorates But they shift
to different fields. For examnle engmeer's
bias shIfted from aViatIOn research to BIOmedical engmeermg.

grapher but he IS applymg those methods to
BIOphYSICS Take Hydraultcs. It IS one of
the olde'>t subjects. But one need not always
work m conventIOnal areas. Ocean engtnecrIng offers vast scope for those speclahsmg
in hydraulics, structures etc. Why should
we allow the RUSSIans and the Japanese to
take all the fish m the Indian Ocean? It IS
we who must be explOltmg them.
Estabhshment? Wellm America, you can
say there does eXIst an EstablIshment 111 some
cases. The Ul11verslty PreSident IS never
approachable and the students hardly see
him except on convocatIon day. It IS
difficult to meet even the Faculty deans. If
there IS an Estabhshment 111 lIT, It has to
be me.
About the ConvocatIon? Wei J, It IS for
you to deCIde. Kerala scrapped It, Madras
hastily scrapped It but had to WIthdraw the
deCISion Our convocation used to last over two
hours Now It la.Hs fOf only 60 mll\utes.
ConvocatIOn addresses can be bormg. But
I always try to call emment people from the
field of sCience
Dr. Bhagavantam, Dr.
Menon, Vikram Sarabhal; and Mr Gtr1IS
the VISitor of the Institute. You know, we
used to have celebratIons on both August
15th and 26th January I thought one was
enough. I have tned to cut out a lot of
fanfare and pomp."

Yes, there seems to be a greater mvolvement In Internal affairs. They are trYing to
spend more In Improvtng the quahty of hfe
of the people.
AcademIc<; are very fnendly to IndIa.
There are many student newspapers and the
faculty schools also put out magaztnes; mostly
frontIer articles In a popular way. There IS
also an annual magaztne. Campuses have
qUietened down conSiderably m the last
year. Their mamattack was on the VIet Nam
polu..y but there IS a pull out from VIet Nam
no\', Also the difficult Job sItuation may be
a reason. There are of course a few mCldents.
The Stanford mCldents; you may have read
about them tn TIME But even there the
faculty conducted an enqUlryand only a few
polItically motivated students protested.
Well, you want me to wmpare the freedom
that an AmerIcan student gets and what an
IITlan gets? Well they are the same. Same
tests same grades. JITlan students fit 111
eaSily there In former tImes, the subject
and tests used to be annoWlced at 5 p.m.
the prevIous evening. Later, It was agreed
that the subject at least should be announced
beforehand and after that, now the schedule
IS put up for the whole semester You may
lIke to study on Sunday and go out on
Monday. There must be scope for adJustments I am not baytng our system IS perfect,
we must keep changmg.
The young people III the U.S. tend to
blame sCience and technology for all the
SOCial Ills They are turmng their books on
Technology and are optmg for the SOCIal
sCIences. ThIS IS eVidenced by a 25 % drop
In undergraduate engmeenng enrolment.
SOCial or SOCietal engmeenng Will receive
high Priority m the comIng decade accordtng
to Dean Chauncey Starr of UCLA.
Even in research, you mllst shift. Work
for a year more on your thesis tOpiC after
your Ph.D. and then shift. If you go on
workmg on the same tOpiC for twenty or more
years, you might make Just fTlnge advances.
Prof. G. N. Ramachandran IS a crystallo-

And so the pleasant sessIon hke all good
thmgs, comes to an end and one comes back
filled With the deltghtful feehng that here IS a
man who IS fnendly and to whom you can
take your problems. The dialogue has not
seen any pIOUS pronouncements, It IS true,
but It gave one the feelmg of warmth, a rare
commodIty these days.

The Passing Show
(At a Social function)
Faces, places,A passing show.
A congregatIOn collects
And smIles and nodsSuperfiCial emotions
Play false notes.
Intermlxmg, a SOCIal rabble
Each With hidden mner thoughts
They all come to
Talk-meamngless, dull, trtte.
None With mtelltgence
None WIth WIt.
For m the passing show
There are few thrills
And fewer memones.
With the end,
The festoons come down
The' Shehnal ' stops
The group breaks
And each returns
To hiS own shell of existence
And salls along With the current
Ttll the next passing show.
