CAMPASTIMES

Spring 1972]

7
minutes'-and that could be the funeral for
this break.

To a student of psychology. the change in
behaVIOur observed, m an IlTlan, when he
enters the tenth semester, "ould be Mrang e
and fascmatmg A new sense of responslblhty burgeons III hIm. Gone are the days
when he used to cut class Without a second
thought Gone too IS the vacant stare that he
used to dIrect at the blackboard or alternatively
at the lecturer's mug. There 13 a sprmgy
purposefulness III hIS walk. HIS eye IS clear
and the perpetual hangover, resultlng from
gUZlhng too much liqUId inspiration, has
dIsappeared.
On~ .eason for thIS transformation could be
the fact that folks have begun to treat hIm downrIght decent nowadays. Attenders bow and
scrape before him and lecturers crack Jokes
and expect hIm to laugh at them. Even HIS
MaJesty, The Head of the Department, consents to give hIm an audience Without the
usual hour long delay Some people are of
the opmlOn that the neW nse m statUS may be
due to the fact that, In a few months' time, he
will be a free man and perhaps In a pOSitIOn to
retaliate. I do not personally endorse thIS
VIeW.

Let's get back to the subject of our study.
He spends a good part of hiS time hangmg
round what were once rarely vIsited places,
such as the library and the department. Reference IS always bemg made to some strange,
exotiC creature called the guide. These references are usually derogatory and rare mdeed
IS the speCimen, who IS Willing to admit that
hIS gUIde knows more about hiS project than
he does.

Our In.,tltute IS perhaps held higher in
esteem than It really deserves-much has been
saId (and wntten I) about the so-called' cream
of the nation' and' one of the best Institutes
for hIgher technological educatIOn', leavmg
very httle for the reformer to face the facts
as they eXist and to shape, straighten and
paint the misshapen, crooked and scratchedup system (or Its mtsuse?)-for sttll the pamful fact remams that III more than half the
sublects It IS a test of the capacity of the
students to by-heart and the shockIng fact
remalO<; that even If the dream comes true-If
a good system IS estabhshed-It IS only a small
frachon of the cream that IS gOIng to take
mterest-the others are satisfied WIth what
they have to do-they rest 10 peace amIdst the
decent marks they have managed to secure
by muggmg m the real sense of the word.
But what one falls to understand IS the sharp
retalJatlOn, the hot reactIon and the locally
steammg reverberation after the Creation of
the brIght Image and the halo. ThiS act has
ItS equal m the case of the French student
who burnt hIS dlstmctIon certificates m front
of hiS prmclpal's room. Why not we just
catch the Idea from the Image and try to Improve what eXists?

A fflend of mine compJamed to me that the
administration of the Campastlmes had become too centrahsed. As a result, the magAzme h.as become a htde more lso1ated from
the student commufllty. An ObVlOUS remedy
to thiS situation would be to have an elected
or nominated candidate from each hostel ill
the adm\filstratll)n of the magazIne. further
thIS would be of great help to the Editor because he could hand over the task of huntmg
for artldes to the hostel representatives The
Literature SectiOns of the hostels are of not
much use for thiS purpose mamly because they
have a lot of other thmgs to do. We could
glv.e It a try.

ThIS seems to be an era of change for our
Institute and the break between hours has
come as a welcome change to many of us,
though It mIght not make a difference for a
few ThiS might help the second hour lecturer aVOid the pamful expenence of standmg
opposite the classroom lookmg at hIS watch
and peepmg mto the class room once ln thIrty
seconds and gettmg cold stares from WithIn 10
the process. But thIS new system might go
well for some time till someone gets a brIght
Idea and says' well, you don't have anythmg
else to do, so I wdl take that extra fifteen

If you happen to step mto his room, you
are likely to find yourself wadmg through a
sea of apphcatlOn forms. Sometimes he may
be found muttenng strange oaths and curses
to htmself Don't get alarmed. He hasn't
cracked up under the strain. He IS Just trymg
to mug up some tough, new words for some
entrance exam.

A deeper study of the phenomenon Will
probably be made by some up-and-commg
student of the behaVIOural sCiences. So I'll
ditch the tOpiC till then.

The average IITlan IS over-worked-this IS
an accepted fact-he works hard for five-and-ahalf days and goes to the Saturday movie to
relax-agreed? The open air theatre IS perhaps the only placc where hiS stram IS released and hIS tops are cooled-agreed? And If
•facts of hfe ' and mls<mes arc <;hown on the
screen-he gets Irfltated mOre IrrItated than
even 1£ the movie IS bad-agreed! But sull
we have to face the facts of I1fe sometime or
the other and If the plain truth about the happemngs III Bangia Desh IS screened-If one
doesn't like It. let hIm Just keep his mouth
shut, lean back and relax-but what one fails
to understand IS what certam people here find
so funny m such a senous matter that they
should start laughmg, Jeenng and passing
certaIn nasty remarks! But there are even
certain desperate, underdeveloped, nasty and
stupId degenerates who look for I somethmg
good' III movies such as thiS and JOI BangIa
Desh. When are we gomg to learn to be
senSIble if not patTlotlc ?
