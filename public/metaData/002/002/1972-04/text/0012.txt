CAMPASTIMES

, What major difference do you find between
the students here and m the US ? '
, Studentq In both countrles are confused.
There, the students feel fatalisltc on account
of the draft Some of them do not even
IdeologIcally. Here, on the other hand,
students feel restles. and Insecure. They
have no Ideas about socIety.'
• About the American students' how does
one correlate the Armies of the Night With a
non-IdeologIcal fear of the draft? If people
risk gettmg theIr skulls bashed 10, they must
beheve m what they are fightIng for.'
• True, such students do eXIst. Most of
the committed students conduct debates on
important political events and various v/eWpomts are exchanged. TopiCS of debate at
our Institute level are tnfantlle by comparison.
To make an Impact one has to be of some
relevance.'
C What sort of an unpact do you have
In
mmd?'
, In the States, parents are totally mdIfferent
to theIr offsprmg, whereas In India, parents
exert an overbearing mfiuence on the kids;
sometImes they are even oppressive. One
must re-educate one's parents and others and
change theIr statIc values m a society whIch IS
d\ namlc by nature.'
. One had VISiOnS of that plastic sermon by
Stepen Stills .
• How does one
re-educate
one's
educators? '
'By exchange of Ideas and by anaiysmg
together, to brmg about an ideological change.
In IndIa-at least In colleges other than the
IITs-the teachers are overworked and underpaId. BeSides, our institutions are Just exam.
-glvmg edifices. In such an atmosphere,
the mtellectual cannot grow. The poittlclans
make It ImpossIble for us to build up our
resources even In the academiC level. We
end up borrowing technology indlscrimmately.'
, Don't you thmk our system of educatIOn
IS sufficiently totahtarlan to stunt growth of
any kmd?'
He smIled at the generous uSe of the word.
, Here, the exammatlons are meant to find
out what one doesn't know and not what one
knows. There seems to be a miSOrientatIOn
of the system. In the States, take-home
exams. are common. ThIS of course IS
faCIlitated by the use of the Honour Code
system which only means you don't fudge
your home-work. One feels a sense of achl~
evement m dolOg a problem on one's own,
rather than In wntmg exammatlOns which
are only tests of memory. If such a code
can be followed here, there Will not be any
need to have an endless senes of exammatlons.'
C Are there any particular
writers you are
fond of ~,
'Frankly, I don't read any odd stuff

is the same. It changes one's outlook completely. One sees money not as the ultimate
end of everything, but only as a temporary
reallocatIOn of energy. The urge for acquIsition IS no more, for energy IS everywhere
and the distributIOn IS dynamIC.
• But consldenng how these potentials are
mterhnked--one can't be an mtellectual after
years of malnutntlon as a chlld-, don't you
agree that M.lrx was stnvmg towards the
same goal of evolutIon? '
· No For Marx said that the mmd is
matter and so man IS an economIc bemg. As
long as hIS economiC needs are satrsfied, he
IS happy. Marx mIght have been adequate
for hiS age, but then, recent find lOgs have
shown that there Iq more to the mmd than
matter. Marx took a specIal case of the
phYSical potential, and of course there IS a
tangible connection WIth the other, but I
thlOk It IS wrong to evolve an Ideology on
the baSIS of eCOnomIcs alone. If the mmd
IS reany matter, how do you explam the
fact that a maJortty of MIddle Amertca,
whIch IS very affluent, IS frustrated and
depressed? '
· I see It now. The Silent Majority IS not
.evolvmg Intellectually.'
True, the reference to psychiC potential
never registered m the reporter's mmd.
MystiCism has always been associated WIth
religIon and pure Black MagiC. Yet, Dr.
Ghlstha spoke warmly of the mystIcs. One
had heard that he IS an Anand Margl, or
could It be that such close acquaIntance With
the Mystery of the Cell had made him respect
the psyche as a tangible entity, dtfferent
from the mtellect?
C RIght'
saId Dr. Ghlstha. 'In our
technological SOCiety, we are not used to
thtnkmg about the problems of the mind.
India IS supposed to be full of mystiCs. But
we never let them evolve wlthtn our society;
they hve m caves. We deprive ourselves of
theIr psychiC strength.'
No, It was difficult to talk of such thmgs.
ObVIOusly one had not paId much thought to
It, yes, there were elements which were
totalttanan m thiS reJectIOn. One wondered
for a fleetmg moment whether one part of
the self had Just curled up and died. And
there was sorrow m thiS death.
We moved on to the next questlOn.
'We have talked of an Ideal society. What
-can the UmversIty do to help 10 Its
.evolution' ?
'The hitch IS that the educators are not
.aware and they do not want to deCide about
society In view of such lack of IDltlatlve,
the st1ldents should be conscious; they should
analyse the problems a..d give thought to
solutions. In the States, students, however
:great the odds agamst them, have made thelt
Jmpact. We could aclueve the same Impact
here, prOVIded our students start thmkmg.'

nowadays. The only exceptIons are scientific
Journals Ind books on SOCial philosophy and
econoIlIlCS by P. R. Sarkar and spIrItual
philosophy by Ananda MuruJee. I find that
mo.,t wnters do not help tn one's evolution.
So I do It myself. There are some, of course,
like O'Casey, who, I feel, IS much better than
most of those pseudo-phIlosophers'
• What about Camus or Sartre ?'
'I have even seen some of Sartre's plays.
But what I wanted to say was that these
people are admittedly confused, and how does
It help me to partake In thIS confUSIOn ~
They do not offer any solutlon'l, nor are they
certam about anything.'
For surely, I Come qUickly, sweet chaos.
One had the theory that perceptIOn IS almost
always killed by certitude. One wasn't
really prepared for a depressmg discussIOn;
It was gettmg late. So after an abortive
dabbling !D eXlstenttaltsm, we came to drugs.
It was a replay of the YogI tn 'Woodstock.'
'The argument that marijuana gives one
greater awareness might be genume but not
wholly acceptable. For If one can find some
other way to InCrease one's awareness permAnently, why fisk boddy harm?'
'God, you sound hke the Reader's
DIgest' I
With a hlOt of Innocence, he smJled.
'Does anybody ever read It? I haven't
for tW() decades Only hIgh school dropouts
and seml-ltterates do.'
Then we talked of the endless coldwar
stones, J. Edgar's storIes and tons of pletJsms
rampant III the mag~llle. Then, fitttn!;ly
enough, we turned to the local press.
'I feel Campasttmes would serve a better
purpose If you could brmg It out more often.'
He pronounced It often. C You can dISCUSS
pohtlcal events bke the Indo-Soviet treaty
and create an awareness all round.'
The interview ended.
One had mIxed feelmgs about the mterview,
but sornethmg remarkable had happened.
Somewhere m the middle of the rap, the
reporter had sought a repneve, a relaxed
moment, In a guessing game.
• Are you from Bombay?'
eYes '.
'Tardeo? '
, No Grant Road.'
, Sleater Road ?'
C No.
But m the neIghbourhood.'
• You must have gone to Xavier's!'
'No, I went to ElphInstone.'
At which pomt he gave up at the mindlessness of the Interlude. Amused, he said,
, People are always askmg me about where I
come from and which caste I belong to and so
forth. It doesn't really matter, you know. I
tell them, " I'm just a cosmic entity.'"
That's hlm-a cosmic entity that says 11
