CAMPASTIMES
wtnd whlsthng between the ears, creating
IClcks on a denuded head-It dId not really
matter whether the last named object looked
boulder-hk<." bare, empty ,\lld desolate or not,
and so I paId up and walked home.
'Good" said neIghbour I, 'You don't look
like one at those hipPIes any more '.

HAIR AND THE MOVIE
The first mkhng that It needed cuttmg was
a 811ght Itch, then greater dIscomfort untIl
finally there I was, walkmg Into a barbershop,
setthng down on an uncomfortable bench
,valtlng for the man behind the now-snlppmg
sCissors and the gleamIng razor to do hb work
on my shock of hair. My surroundlllgs were
famlhar enough-there were the usual calendars
deplctmg languorous, Improbably-figured
ladles stretched out on fantasy-landscapes;
photographs of the NatIOns Leaderb and the
barber's family between these, and a large
framed picture ImpressIvely titled 'Catalogue
-of Human HaIr dressmg' showmg weIrd
heads equipped WIth weirder halr-dos. The
eye roamed over all these until finally my
turn came and I clImbed tnto the chaIr,
glanced at the thmg stanng back from the
mIrror and went tnto my usual state durmg
halr-cuts-a trance like state m whIch the
mmd was set to work on problems of the
cosmos, warnes about the Future of the NatIOn
4lnd glfls, until eventually the barber stated
that he had finl~hed. that would be x rupees
please. The time had come for the second
glance tOto the mirror and I duly glanced,
only to look back over my shoulder to venfy
that no one else was lookmg mto the mirror
at the same time. Yes, on second look, It
was me, but never mmd-apart from the
shght dlscomfort of feehng the cold wmter

And there was the sad, CUriOUS, depressmg
part of the aff,ur. Why does the middle class
thlllk that hippies are Bad, DIrty, Immoral,
pot-headed, and a million more words with
bad connotations? That It does thInk so
thclc i~n't much doubt about; one has only
to look at the magazmes It reads to find
stones where the villatn IS a kurt a + beadweanng-kmfe-wleldlng
und gang-runmng
gent WIth long haIr. Granted that thebe
magazmes have no mtellectual ment whatsoever, they yet reflect a stute of mInd, an
attItude whIch IS bl.lsed very much agamst
these people, whose only CrIme, as far as I
can see, IS that of wantmg to lIve theIr own
lives and havmg that certam, very childlIke
naIVete which makes you teU the tIcket
collector III the expre",s 'You have so many
seats on thIS tram, please, please give me Just
one' • But there It IS. They can't see, and
they won't even try.
Because unfortunately, Oh so unfortunately,
they don't see the need to. Complacence,
the dorrunant state of mmd of the fat-assed
proVIdes the mabliity to thlllk and envy,
commg from deep wlthm the sub-conSCIous
mmd of the always oppressed M.C. agamst
the free and beautIful people, bubbles out
mto spasms of hate that, at their least harmful
makes them gIVe bad connotatIOns to words
like 'hippie', 'drugs', haIr etc and at their
worst, Into blind, downnght anu-IntellectualIbm True totahtanaOlsm IS not dictatorshIp
or commumsm but the unwLllmgness of the
in-between people to accept or tolerate any~
thlOg they don't understood anythlOg that
does not fit Into their groove. Covered 1D
Fuller's earth and water, unable to see
through the soap-suds they have created

[Spring 1972
around themselves, they may be pItIable, but,
all the same, Its hard not to scream.

Crltlclsmg a movIe has always seemed to me
to be a pretty tough Job-elther It IS too
tnte be worth wasting paper, 10k and time
over, or else It IS So mtellectual .md New-wave
that one always has the nagglOg feel 109 that
one may have wlssed out something Important, that one IS IcavIng a breach for
somebody to entel IOta and CritiCize you, the
pOOl fool out of eXI.,tence It seems so much
easIer to ,Write. about tec.iIngs, (for one thlOg
you don t have to gIVe your opmlon on
matters Itke photography, direction and all
that I) because there are, m an absolute
sense, no 'correct' feelmgs, but only fashIOnable ones. And so the feeling mduced by
, Dastak' IS a beautiful fcellOg, naiVe and yet
very worldly, full of hope and promIse (m
an age where CYntClsm about matters lIke
trust and hope IS the fashIOn) very earthy
and tam liar and ContaInlOg a staggering
amount of empathy , Dastak' I am told,
means knock In thiS context It IS not
Postman's but the other kind, th~ one all the
dIrty books rare about, and the mam theme
of the film IS the effect of thiS tvpe of knock
on two people who have Just -hmshed the
rItual walk around the fire and have come
straight to the Big City With the same Ideas
about people that We had Just before we
came mto thIS mIll. ThiS being so, It IS
mevltable that the mOVie be about sex, and
yes, sex IS there, but It IS a taut, restramed
sex, full of dark forebodings of uglIness
rumblmg WIth the dIscontented, laboured and
paId-for sex Just outSIde the fear-bolted door
contammg a warnIng that thIS IS a~
mtlammable, eaSIly perverted thmg, very
dependant for Its fragIle compleXIon On external forces and con.dltlOns. LIttle touches
scenes of great sensItIvIty-like the depiCtlO~
of the herome's sister In adolescent love· the
tIme when Salma tries to waken 'her
boredom-drugged mtnd by smokmg her
husband's cIgarettes, all these Immerse you
in a great river of empathy flowmg gently
throughout the mOVIe, broken mto little
streams finally by the musIcal reaffirmatIon
of patnotlsm, to be collected afterwards and
remembered fondly.
BOBO.
