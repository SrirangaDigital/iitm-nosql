CAMPASTIMES

Hats off to Vaidyanathan on being
chosen to represent the state zn
Badminton (shuttlecock) We expect
more from him zn the days to come

BEATEN AT THE POST
IIT'~ performance~ m thL Inter-Untvel"'lty
Champlon"hlps make sorry TL "Idmg
We
alwa\s beg!'1 wLlI, plt\ \\ell but end badh
Year hefore last at Hubh, WL could have
easily reached the final, but for a la~t WIcket
Karnatak p'l£tner~hlp whIch tIlted the ~cales.
Last year, \\e all but had the matLh In the
bag agaln"t Andhra hav1l1g taken the first
InnIng' lead but thr~w It away becau,c of
some Indlfflrent fieldIng, a mIddle order
co\lapo': and It be admitted, some amateUrish
umptnng ThIs year wa<; no ell.ceptlon, ,~e
had the hIghly fancIed Mysore rumllng only
to lo,e the InItIatIve and the match as well
We started well on the first dav and diSmIssed Mysore for a low total The chIef
wreckers were Gowrlshankar and Murahdharan.
The former, an off-~p1nner who bowls WIth
the popular c1ose-m leg Side field struck a
deadly length and made the ball rear up dlsconcertmgly off the true Manna Wicket. He
wa,,; easily our outstandmg Cricketer and under
the captaIncy of th." former Indian schools
Cricketer, next vear mIght mean the golden
year of our Cricket. Ma} be I am thlllking
aloud I don't know Anyway all eVidence
seems to pOint to It Murahdharan our leftarm medIUm pacer bowled with ,enom and It
was obvIOUS that our coach Ramsmgh had
done him a world of good. Whcn We ,tarted,
all seemed well till the spate of run-outs
began and for sometlme the whole mnmgs
went berserk But some stout resIstance by
Ramesh saw u~ creep past Mysore's total and
the Vital fir~t mmngs lead was ours
When Mysore began agaIn, they understandably went for runs but Gownshankar ''vas
again too good for them. When theIr Innlllgs
ended, we were really slttmg pretty, havmg
all the tIme In the world to get the necessary
runs or If we wanted, to pull down the
shutters and play for the draw which would
make us wmners But our batting wIlted
agamst some aCcurate left-arm Spill bowlmg
from Mysore's pmt-sl7ed No. I I and we were
shot out much before the target Mahesh
batted WIth pleasmg stvle to carry hiS bat
through, though one felt that With WIckets
falling all around hIm, he might have tned to
hit the ball harder and take more of the
(an bowling OplI1lon which the big !IT crowd
there shared WIth me). However as an mntn!!S
it was flawless and showed the batsman's
class.
And so we returned, beaten at the post
again.

The Untold Story

A Letter to the Editor

TillS not Lt. Gen. Kaul wntmg an article
m CampastmlCs but a sportsman who 1<; qUltc
oftLn rec\\gmzed .1.<; tomm.tnder of the cTlcket
ttam hy those young Godav,\f1 sportsman
Th~ ~ports ,Iet!\ Illes started thIS year With a
deterrmnauon ot bewmmg all-IlT champIOns
onLe agllll Unfortunattly' b,ld-Iuck' proVIded .I. blockade whIch saw the abrupt end of
the meet Anyhow good show by the Football team In the Inter-collegIate league
brought back confidence III Mr. Anantharaman's he.lrt ,,111ch probably made him
thmk of the day we would have been the
football champIOns among lIT's.
Back dgam to the turbulent tOPIC' The performance of the cflcket team', mdeed It was
far bdowell.pectatlOns. Even though we were
undefeated III the Ill\er-colleglate leaguc, we
suffered an unexpected defeat III our first
But I am sure that
IIlter-unlverslty match
the team WIll be pulled back by Gounshanker
under the gUidance of our staff-member Dr.
G. N Gillsta, next year.
Anyhow, thiS year saw administrative reformations In the cTlcket actiVItIes In the
past Gymkhana has been spendmg Rs 10,000
towards CTleket whIch was used tor material,
travel, camp, relreshments, umplTlng charges
and other contlngencles.-(Blazers
\\ere
separate) With an overall cut III budget,
Cricket was gIven Rs 9,500 thiS year. I was
not only able to Include all the above but Was
also able to allocate money for shoes (Rs 2 2 5),
Coachmg (R,. 650), Blazers (Rs 420) and
Sweaters (Rs 300) (Hats off to Mr. Gupta).
Indeed these fact~ made the crIcket team and
the PreSIdent to VisualIse that all was not well
m the proper use of cncket funds III the past
An Interestmg pOint to note IS that our everhard-workmg hockey coach was transformed
mto a temporary Cricket Manager.
The
Cricket team feels sorry to have dlssappomted
him but we try to wIpe off hiS unhappmess by
openlv extendmg Sincere thanks to hun for his
token services to the Cncket team.
I am doubly sure that by nOw Prof. Gupta
IS aware of the loopholes In Gymkhana.
With two years experience backed up by hIS
mherent quality of makmg reformatwns, I feel
GuptaJI should spend conSiderable energy thiS
summer In makmg Administrative reformatIOns It IS mdeed a pathetiC Sight to see
captains cuttmg the fourth hour class and
gomg to Gymkhana office. With apologies to
whomsoever It may concern, I disclose the
fact that our hterary secretary and myself are
workmg more as ASSistant PTls than as student members
To some extent the same is
true of Narendra and TV. I

In the prevIOUs ISSUe of Campasltmes there
appeared an artIcle prot{'stmg agamst the
screenmg of a certam mO\1e at the 0 A T.
ThIS movIe happened to beltttle the German
NatIOn
One tact the writer of that article
seem~ to have mIssed IS that the O.A T IS In
India and not m Germany, so we need not be
b13~ed towards anythmg wluch lowers German
prest'ge. The fdet that our Institute IS partly
supported by the Germans does not mean that
we should bc theIr lacb.eys and refuse to speak,
hear of ~ee anvthlllg agamst them.
ThIS partIcular person's anger seerns to have
been aroused because the movIe In question
happened to be a SOViet product A lot of
Amencan trash we observe so lovmgly on the
o A.T screen IS nothmg but propaganda. A
• dlfty dozen' Yankees or Tommies bashmg
away mto German fOrtIficatIOns IS a common
SIght and mCldentally much admired by the
audience. Nobody so fa!' seems to have
objected to such obvIOUS lies Anyway If we
take thiS as the standard, I don't understand
why we should object to a slIlgle Russ13n tank
playmg havoc amongst German forces
Another IIlteresung pOint about the movie
was that It showed German soldIers as humanbelllgs With human hearts and not Just automaton, under Hitler's command ThIS IS seldom
seen m other popular war mOVies
The myth of Amencan fnendship has long
ago been exploded. I don't see why we should
turn a blmd eye towards their ::.lyness

lIT FINISHES ITHIRD
IN THE STATE
Just after the mauguratlon of the badmmton
court In lIT a State league champIOnship was
held In shuttle badmtnton at the Nehru
StadIUm
IIT represented by S Valdyanathan, EdWin Snmvasan and Sastry did extremely well beaung most of the teams 3.-0.
Only the star studded teams Sterhng club,
Martme C.ub and Ruby Sports gave some
trouble to liT
HT beat Ruby Sports 3-2
and lost to Sterling Club and Martm at the
same scores. A notable fact IS that III the
entire champIOnships both EdWin and Valdyanathan did not lose a match. Now that we
have a court for ourselves we can expect lIT
to go higher up III the years to come.
