Dr. Ghistha-A PsychoSocial Political
Philosophical Rap
(The followmg mterVJew, due to lack of
proper recordmg eqmpment, has been retonIn the narrative style of the mterviewer Though the attltudes reflected are
necess:mly those of the mterVlcwee, rephrasIng of his prcclse statements becomes unavoIdable)
Reporters have a ~ense of smell EspecIally
the dle-h<lrds In Campastlmes A wluff, a
flash and an mtervlew Issues torth The
people arc chosen by mstmct and so are the
<{uestlOns asked to fill 10 the reqUIred eIght
hundred for your money's worth In the P1St
we have been InspIred by all m'lnner of odd
.objects Ii blond beard, :l paunch coupled
WIth a genl\\l smile, an obstmate beret. ThIS
tIme we opted for flowered ties. A c10setful
()fthem
The proud owner of the saId closet IS Dr.
DhanJoo N Glustha, the Head of the FdCUlty
ot BIO-engmeenng He has been around
since July last Dr Ghlstha IS n'Jt too fond
of taU,mg abou.t IllS ongms However we
managed to get the lowdown on him. he IS
fair, five-foot-slx, 130 lbs. or so, sports a
-cherubiC smlle and pots of flowered tIes-;usually with pmk shirts to match Born m
Bombay, he graduated from the VJTI, went
2.broad for higher studies and was at large In
the United States for nearly a decade. HIS
last stint was at the Umverslty of Wash\llgton after which he arrived at our own
Ins~ltute for settmg up the latest of the
Department,,-BJO-englneermg Dr Ghlstha
IS mdrrted and has two children Whew
Now, to the rap.
One IS loath to deSCribe the conVersation
.any further than what the Imposmg tItle
aff<Jrds, for, gentle reader (no holy wrath
nOw I), a post prandial seSSIOn With a pleasant
man of gClllal diSpOSItIOn mu~t be of equIvocal relevance, If only because the reporter
15 biased upto here regardmg the Issues mvolved A casual glance at the tOpiCS dls-cussed may not shock an UT(an, bu.t It
mIght easIly bore him. At any rate, we
chose to talk on a v:lTlety of subjects which
might be of Interest to the readers SOCial
commItment of the academiCIans, pohtlCS,
progresslve utilisation theory, Marx, the parental lfi'\tltutlon, evolutIon, mmnc, Readers'
Digest, drugs and an assortment of other
thmgs. which one no longer remembers,
because, as the wISe edItor put It, reporters
iigure small In the matter of rote memory.
Dr. Ghlstha, whose attitudes go farther than
Ilberal-a hmt less alIenated m fact a suggestIOn of ongmal analYSIs-had a lot to say.
One began by askmg him about the vanou'l
faculties of blO-cnglnCenng Apparenth, he
loves IllS work Offhand, he mentIOned a
number of applIcations medlcme, for one
especlallv re<;on,tru<:tton engmeenng, surgery
and so forth BeSides, blO-engmeenng lends
us an IOslght Into the sClentdic detaIls of
the vanous blOloglcal functions.
'How doe'l It feel to be back here~'
• Even If the atmosphere IS what one IS
used to, the technological level IS not msplring enough' Fear of the technology-hound
gnawed at the roots MisapprehensJOn ' In
a technological SocIety the goals are dliTerent
In India, the objective IS to give a decent
kind of hfe to our poor mJillons.'
, Granting tflat It IS a worthy cause, what
part docs a techologlst have III It ?'
'Technologists should be conscIOUS enough
to evaluate the role of technology m the
vanous maladIes of our society So theirs
IS a positIOn of responslblhty They should
prevent the abuse of technology. Yes, one
must be soclally committed. I used to work
at NASA but I qUIt.'
'Take NASA. Do you think the amount
of money Spent on Its varrous projects could
be spent 10 better ways, for example, In
~Id of the under~pnvlleged ~,
'I thmk II IS an Improper allocation of
pnorltles. But the most blatant breach of
SOCial trust IS hemg carned on III InStitutIOns
like the IDA-Institute for Defense Andlysb.
'ThiS was one of the baSIC Issues behmd
the Colu.mbla InsurrectIon.'

• In MIT too. They have branches 1D all
the top ulllven.lties, where the bram~ of the
country carryon thiS kind of research
'Does that mean the effect or napalm on
the human ~ystcm or so?'
'Yes. That and many other. Which 1$
wlw I chose blo-engmecrmg I feef. all
sCIentIsts <>hould come together and deCide
not to work for technology associated wLth
destruction and ,mmhl1atIon Of cour'le,
natlOnahsm and pohtlcal paranoia play a
major role III thl'> Situation The poittiClans
play up thIS feelmg to a frenzy As a result,
the technologlst~ spend their time working
on how to kIll people mO'lt effiCiently, thmkIIlg only of the
mtelleCtual challenge

• SInce the academICians are the men who
an m~trumental. Isn't It obvIOUS that they
should be aware of the purpose behmd
theIr work?'
'PolitiCians mess up theIr mmd'l WIth
natJOnallstic Jargon PolLucs IS the only profeSSIOn With no quahficatlOns for entry In
fact, nobody IS better quahtied than the
academiCIans to deCide on the use of technology If we had tntelhgent polIttclans,
things would be a lot bettt'r '
'But dren't they taktng an eXistential fisk
regardmg the tntelligence of the polttlclans?
Why don't they make theIr own deCISIOns If
they are better qualified?'
'Such deCISIOns cannot be made by the
use of technology alone Onc has to thmk
about other aspects. other ImplicatIOns'
• Wouldn't It be better If all technologIsts
Were Left III Ideology ~.
, Depends entIrely on the cIrcumstances.
An extreme Left SCIentist m Commumst
Chma would prove to be as harmful as a
flght-wmg WASP m the IDA. The pomt,
however, IS that a responSible person should
not submit hImself to totalttanan Ideas.
Rather. he '\hould develop analytical solutions
on hiS own to ~octal problems. Th!s of
course would mean that a technologl~t needs
to develop a philosophIcal attitude and an
awareness of SOCial 'lclences. Then, perhaps,
we Can talk of a global society where natIOnal
barners are SpUriOUS, petty po\ltIcs dl,>pensable Then we could evolve a mori> rational
dlstnbutlOn of resources among the peoples
of the earth Some say that wars are meVltable on account of the riSIng population
But It IS a fact that OUr ablltty to reproduce
Will come down drastically as the envl1:onment becomes less hostile. We don't need
warS for our problems.'
I Talking of global sOCiety, o~ what Ideology
would It be based? •
'A total Ideology whIch encompasses aU
walks of hfe Tota1 but not totalItanan.
Apparently that IS what IS wrong WIth cap Italtsm and other Ideologies. In the fOlmer,
one uses the yardstick of whether It promotes an mdlvldual matel'laJlv. Mixed economy, as It IS practised III Indta IS wholly
JIlcongruent I, for one, am fond of the
Prog'resslVe UtIlizatIOn Theory, proposed by
P R "arkar. The theory advocatea that all
raw produce should be with the State.
Steel plants and other mdustnes should be
10 the hands of co-operatIves.
We can leave
the small bustnessmen to their eXIstential
gambles Only so long a, they are small.
'Would tflat mean the amount of capItal
mvolved? '
'I should think so. Then we can evolve
a practical and Just socIety free of explOItation.' The dITty word.
'What IS your Idea of an Ideal soctety?'
'Mv Idea of an Ideal socIety IS where
every smele person ran evolve to the fullest
extent. Everyone has three different kmds
of potential phYSical, Intellectual and psychic.
The tendency among the people IS to respect
only the first, and they onent all the rest
towards one's phYSIcal potentIal-money and
other mater131 acqulsltlOns-, which IS very
wrong. ThiS means you are sttfhng the tntelkctuals and other people with psychiC
potentIal. People must be made to realIse
that they can be happy even without
money'
'How IS that possible? '
'There IS a theory called SubJectlfication
of ObJectiVity. One views every object as a
crystalh.:atton of cosmIC energy. The Source
