OVER A CUP OF AYE-AYE TEA

The new class tlmlOgs cannot pass off as a
change for the better. because It IS not, however much one m'ly try to defend It. The
four periods iO the mornmg were not tlrmg,
unless you wanted to dunk 111 terms of hoursh s What then about the poor fellows

hours togethcl IS a. bit more tmng phYSIcally
than raking d\lwn lecture notes Is-mentallv, If
an equatIOn of thIS sort IS at all possIble.
Whatever has happened, some people have
been fooled
We have kept the Gaj., we have kept the
deer and the speedbreakers. Now, are not
we proud of the crazy hours we keep III the
mornmg?

Have you seen small lIttle JUDlor englOeers

remove honoured guests of the Insutute from

(ThIs story comes first-hand-from a hand
that stuck me a coke-not Just to get thiS bit
pubhshed-but some more too. I Will keep It

WINTER 1971
Come hither, and have a look at our very
own lIttle hut, called the Shuttle-badmmton
hut In wluch \Jne plays shuttle-badmmtontwo' If one plays doubles (Oh hell I)
SUMMER 1974
• BUilt m the year 1971, thiS structure, made
entirely of local timber, tougher than even
steel, With thatched roof, more lead-proof
than even concrete, among the bushes and
trees of the lIT, thus provldmg easy access
and an excellent resort for the buds, ants and
wood-eaters (little creatures that eat wood),
was when It was, the best roof under the best
sun provldmg the best of Shuttle-badminton
to the Shuttle-badminton-hungry mllhons

The wood-eaters,

In

the early Summer of

1972 moved In on the rafters of which there
were'many. After about three years of hectic
heWing and digestion, the greedy hoardes
brought about theu own downfall, and the
roof toO came down With them-and these
feathers you seen on the ground before you
ladles and gentlemen don't have nothmg to do
With the birds Don't let them fool you any.
I Will tell you what they are

(If you really are the smart type don't
read thiS story backwards. Try to figure out
the case all by yourself.) 'Case of the
precIous pmky.'
You see, I have been having thIS Itchy
feelIng m the pinky of my rIght hand, (the
fourth finger from the thumb and excludmg
it), smce my 14th birthday whIch was the loth
of February 1966 - Monday? Tuesday?
Wldnesday? I can't say which I should ask
my mother, or better stIlI my grandmother.

And then comes a doctor who says • you
mUSt rest thiS Itchmg member, my son,' and
polItely puts my pmky m my front pocket
(the back \\ould be uncomfortable, in case I
happen to SIt down) and asks me not to take
It out under any circumstances. [Ha 1 ha I a
dumb cluck, thought I, In a tone packed With
downflght sarcasm-(I can be very sarca.tlc
at times) what you don't know IS that thIS very
thIDg has been my favourite pastime. Smce
my fourteenth bIrthday.]
For forty days and ferty flights, the Pinky
rested m my left front pocht (two days thiS
Side of SIX weeks as you might or mIght not
notice, I neither complamed, nor grumbled,
and boy, can I complam and/or grumble at
times), after which period, the doc. came and
ceremonlously hftcd the now pale-looking
finger and shook IllS head tWice to the rtght,
once to the left, like when you are takIng
weights and dropped the pmky With dIsgust.
It stili Itches there and I have ants 111 my
pants and m my pockets. Never agam shall I
stIck my pmky III my pockets or In my pants,
(It IS hoped, 1t IS needless to say, that thiS
IS not a true story, but a false story, the
proof for whIch can be obtamed from my
mother, or better still my grandmother, who
IS all set to testIfy that I was born m March
and not m Mayor m the other ten months of
the year, which I have so very arbitrarily
missed out. My apologies.)

THE REFUGE
The warmth of the afternoon sun and the
monotonous whlspenng of the Wind brought
about a sleepy affect on me as I sat In a
relaxed holtday mood With my back to
the sun. The newspaper on my lap read of
the oppression III Bangia Desh and the plIght
of lakhs of refugees I was pondermg over the
outcome of the recently announced ceasefire.
All of a sudden I heard a muffled cry
followed by a loud plamtlve wall piercmg the
Silence ot the afternoon. I turned, and
shadmg my eyes from the duect sun witnessed a SCene that disturbed my tranqutlhty. A
small child aged about three rushed out of
the servants' quarters which are Just behmd
our bungalow. The child was being followed
hard on heels by a woman who looked flushed
With anger. She was brandlshmg a stlck-a
piece of firewood to be more precise-hke a
sword longing to unleash Its wrath un a
delIcate mass of flesh and bones. What
CrIme the child had committed to Instigate
thiS woman to reloort to such ruthless
vengeance I did not know; the pIcture was
one nobody would be eager to sec.

Before I could thlllk further the pursued
child ran through the open garden gate
straight mto my arms (which I had unconsCIOusly opened to receiVe It). Innocence
Itself, thIS small girl's face was marred by
welts obViously from a beatmg she had already
suffered Uncea~mg tears poured from her
gleaming eye ... !Ike an uncontrolIable nver
from the high mountams. In that moment
of confUSIOn I did not notice her SOiled green
frock and dIshevelled half which all went to
reflect how neglected she was.
The child was In my firm gnp as It clung
close to me for securIty from the chasing Jdde.
The woman, obVIOusly one of the servants
was dressed III a dirty whIte saree. Shew as
puffing and panting as she came into the
garden after the chIld. She stopped short as
she saw the child WIth me. She started
mumblmg some mproper reasons about the

9
child dlsobeymg her. I reproached her WIth
all the seventy I could command, though I
did not read out any moral lectures to her.
The child was pressmg (closer and looking
into my eyes hke a hunted animal. After
gettmg a word of assuranCe from the woman
about not beatlng l the chud any more I let
go the chtld reluctantly.
I remembered my newspaper. I went
back to It and picked It up.
The refugees are on the way back again,
Hmmm . . . . .
PRADI!I!P.

Random Reflection
The flames of love
kmdled by a surge
of a paSSion now dymg In embers
In the mormng calm,
as a tender kiSS, the rustle of sdk
fade mto the dawn
'
HoverIng uncertamty,
the bee transcends to a new level
the throes of death lurking.
Dreams-the pores of creatIOn
edlfymg realtty,
Flowermg, FlallJUs, fluctuatmg
-bones of Contention
Creation an mtrmslc expenencedIssonant, Vibrant and distant .
a clap of thunder,
heraldmg stormy days ahead
Meandering, distracting, millinsthe mflux
of a stream of thoughts unfathomed'
Fall's messengers
'
Flxmg the deadline of declSlon profound.
Gropmg, Gnppmg,-a struggle eternal
agamst odds heavy and mfernal,
The reVival of hope,
A flash to dazzle
the bleakness wlthm,
nurtured by Ideas unfounded;
empty of mmd, empty of hfe,
the chord twangs dangerously-yet
love IS not forlorn,
memor es of :rester-year
crowd fondly
the delvlDg eye
Life, In Its charIsma,
IS a joy to behold,
now frowmng, now smdmg
1U a manner bemgn.
TWilight fades-a lazy splotch of red,
hearths are ahght,
togetherness IS • In '.
As the beams of the receding ray cluster,
a streak, famt yet distinct, deepens,
deadenmg the stmg of years
gone by

Plaint in Despair
o

Moon! Sweet Moon! Come! Come
SWiftly and smile
The grIsly gloom th'ilt rules thIS realm of
mght.
Dark, yet for my gloomy heart, full of
hght.
Come 0 Sweet Moon I In vour romantic
form,
In your misty arms, In your glowmg charm.
I find, to soothe my bleedmg heart, a balm.
Yea 0 Moon' Bleedmg In the heart of
mme,
By sorrow squeezed and rack'd by ragmg
pam
While 10 the past sojourn my JOYs balfslam.
But they won't die J They ta1l me tho' not
lead,
For whIle the thorny tracks of life I tread
Thlckenmg shadows of Wild gloom precede.
While I thus search for distant paradise
HIS S"ble Majesty blmd-folds my eyes
WIth unwanted pams in luring disgUIse.
