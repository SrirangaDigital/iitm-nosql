UNCLE SAM'S

There is somethmg refreshingly simple about
IndIan mythology; about any mythology for
that matter. I am reminded of the one where
the poor elephant-always a symbol of
blundenng goodness ill these fables-on bemg
attacked by a crocodile unplores the Almighty
to help hIm. The plot here IS the one and
only plot of all eXlstenc~-the temporary
trIUmph of treachery over SimplICity followed
by the greater trIumph of Good over EVIl.
But when people' advance' m cl\'lhzatJOn, In
addItion to buddmg skyscrapers they forget
these elementary truths. ' Ah ' look at thIS
young Blackle trymg to compare himself to
God' the cyntcal Yankee may scorn. But
somebody must tell hun that God does not
mean just the biggest Phantom tn the biggest
space SUit chewmg the biggest gum and
watchmg the biggest ball game(. slttmg In the
Whitest house.
There was a wicked man calIed Yahya
Khan who deCided to kill everybody In hIS
house who wanted to be frec. As he
could not do It fast enough he asked
another wicked man called Nixon to PATTON
hIm on the back. NIxon, who had a sense of
humour, liked the Idea Immensely because
hiS faVOUrite Joke dUring Saturday ntghts was
how everyone thought he was a champion of
freedom. But there were some people who
had heard that Joke before; a lady called
Mrs. Indira Gandhi was one of them. She
asked him politely why he had sO many black
stams on blS .... hlte coat, bemg a frank lady
she told him It remmded her of all sorts of
thlnga-' VIet Nam' she said; 'Cuba' she
added 'Dommlcan Republic' she persisted;
, Alabama' was almost on her hps. The host
became very angry. He told her that she Will
not receive any more gifts from him. She
smIled and went away. When she went home,
she found that her house was full of people
who had fled from her neIghbour Khan,
NIxon's pal. She pohtely asked her neighbour
to put hIS house m order so that she could
hve peacefully. He replIed by callmg 'her
'that woman' and NIxon was so happy with
hIS friends' politeness that he spent a whole
day with Yahya Khan's frsends shOWing them
all hIS trophies of war. But the lady had had
enough. Sh{' went mto Yahya Khan's house,
qUietly removed hIS millIon from It and gave
It back to the Innocent people who had come
to her for succor. 'AggressIOn' started the

We had fflends the world over in our
struggle for the hberatlOn of BangIa Desh.
People everywhere who believed Ifi baSIC
human values rallied round to our Side. I am
remmded of a comment which struck me as
tYPical of the mood. ChIldren of Sixth grade
of an elementary school In Texas held a debate
on the right:. and \\fongs of the Indo-Pakistan
conflict and took a vote which was overwhelmmgly m IndIa's favour. They wrote to
Mrs. GandhI' , We know that our country IS
agamst you: but our class has voted for you '.
But III all thiS, we seem to forget one thing;
that Amenca IS a democracy and Mr. Nixon
is the popularly elected leader of the Amcncan
people. All the ttt-bits of news reachtng us
from that land don't add up to mean that
American LonSClence has been stncken by
what has happened. The American people are
by and large Indifferent In spite of some glOriOUS
exceptions hke Chester Bowles WE SHOULD
NOT FORGET THAT IN SPITE OF THE
INHUMAN ATTITUDE OF NIXON, HE
IS ALMOST SURE OF WINNING THE
PRESIDENTIAL ELECTION
LATER
THIS YEAR. ThIS only shows that an
Amenean PreSident can break all moral laws
and shU be the Man of the Year If only he IS
selfish enough to see to It that Amencan global
mterests do not suffer. In fact the most
stnkmg truth of the twentieth century has been
the amazmg IsolatIOn of the Amencan people
who constitute the SIlent maJonty. May be
Bangia Desh might be a nice change on their
T.V. from the usual cornftake and filter upped
ads but nothmg more. For the average
Amencan the most Important thmg IS hiS
comfort, hIS happmess and hiS cock-eyed sense
of morality. That has been the lesson of
Iustory , and to people who talk about AmerIcan
Aid I can only remind them of Mrs. GandhI's
explanation of the nature of ' ForeIgn Aid'.
Which does not mean we are not selfish.
The mass exodus that takes place every September from IndIa to Amenca IS the most
selfish movement I can thmk of. The reason
most often put forward IS that facIlities commensurate WIth one's talents are not available'
In thIS country.
If these 'talented' people
contlOued to stay m thiS dirty country, they
WIll become frustrated, .... e are told. I DO
NOT QUESTION THE FACT THAT
OUR INDUSTRY AND RESEARCH are
not as advanced as Amenca's. But what I
cannot understand about thiS dIrty bUSiness
are these two pOints; one how many of our
young graduates runmng away from realIties
have actually reached that standard where IndIa
cannot offer anythmg mOre to them. Remember
they are not gomg there for theIr doctorate (It
IS a debatable pomt If even that IS Justtfied)
but for Just a degree The only explanatIOn
I can thmk of IS that It IS their baSIC fru<;tratlOn that makes them run away. You may
qUip back saying all top posts In Indian research and mdustry are occupied by people
who have had some sort of trammg In the
Western world, I don't deny It. But what
I detest IS the tendency on the part of the
young graduate admittedly bnlhant graduateto go to the 'UtopIa', get some sort of a
degree and then take a Job and deCide that
the happy endmg has come. ThiS pleasureseeker can be only compared to the hungry
Easterners of the Gold Rush days. There
must be some concerted actIon agamst such
unpatnotlc desertion. As long as people with
thiS mentality eXist In thIS country, Nixon
can be sure of his pOSitIOn m India.

We as a peop care S I. When Pakistan
launched Its dastardly attacks on us on the
rd
3 December, though our armed forces hIt

back WIth llghtmng speed, the clvllran populatIOn was slower to respond. But the slowness of the reactlon m our Institute must take
the cake. The Saturday mOVie, believe It or
not, on the 4th December, featured Mr.
Nixon's' hlstonc peace talks With YugoslaVia
In the greater caus<- of democracy and Irct dom.'
In any other country It would not have been
shown. Bllt If It had been shown, It Would
have been hooted back to Its grave. We dId
none of these. We sat and watched as the
sabre-rattltng hypocnte talked of people's
fights and the moral law. I prayed that all
our students had been there and had not gone
away on vacatIOn. They would definrtely have
put thmgs nght.

ThiS new part-time work system mtroduced
by the Library AuthOrItIes seems amuslOg.
One wonders what they are trymg to do, anyway. I would like to pomt out certalD facts
to them. Nobody tn the IlT IS all that
poor; not so poor that ten rupees a day IS
going to make much of a dIfference. India IS
a country WIth fantaSbc unemployment problem. If there IS work to be done In the
library we can advertise for some people to
apply and do our ltttle to give employment to
deservmg young men. We students are not
gomg to be affected matcnally by the lIttle
money we mIght make but If even half-a-dozen
young graduation are given Jobs we would
have done a lot more.
Perhaps, the Library badly wants some
pubJrclty and the system they want to rntroduce
may look mce m an annual report. But If
they thmk that are becommg very advanced
In theIr methods, I can only say that they are
hving In a world of theIr own.

It was mdeed a great pIty that the meet was
cancelled; expected and Justified as It was.
Our contmgent was really confident and would
defimtely have run through any oppositIOn.
Hard luck, boys, show them next year.

STORM
Rlow, blow 0 you brave and balmy Auster
And roll the waves that rave and dance In
glee,
You're the WInner of the grave disaster.
Go WIld or mIld and hnger O'er the lea
Where no cow lows, no blade of grass now
heaves.
o see the SIght you're never wont to see.
Nowhere you'll find a tree wuh trembling
leaves
And the nesthngs scattered from ItS shatterarms.
All have come to gnef; no one ltves, and
grIeves.
The unrelenting queen of sea and storms,
The partner With the wend sisters three,
Made you mad to man her own crested
charms.
Soon the sun to the darker world did flee
And the grey storm-clouds dId mvade thesky,
While you echoed the roanngs of the sea.
It ram ed, it thundered, the bIlIous leapt
hIgh
And roused the sleepmg ham to meet lts.
doom
In grIsly gloom; none escaped to Sigh or
cry.
To see the ever charmrng beauttes bloom
The sun came mountmg up the eastern
sky
And saw none but the stIll lmgermg gloom.
