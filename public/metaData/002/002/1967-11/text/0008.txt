CAMPASTIMES

I am Maithreyan - - the Maithreyan, of course. My vital statistics
after the summer vacation are
50 - 60 - 50. In the language, of
the layman, this is the equ.ation to a Barrel. I have a
great physique. (Any questions?) when I walk, no guy
ever misses me; I rarely
miss anyone', I speak
well. Even my seniors
who ragged me know
this. I have defeated left
Ronb!. Parameshwaran
(III/S) by speaking for
hours on nothing.
I am the chief distraction
in the N.C.C. It is funny
this year the uniform does
not fit me. Last year it did
--almost; So I attend all
parades in mufti. The other
cadets envy my unceremoniousarrival. I roll into the parade
ground five minutes late and get
my attepdance,The way I charge
up to my officer is a thrill to
watch. It is ~citing as I stop inches
·of him. My body vibrates, setting
up sympathetic vibrations all round.

I am a good sport. Only occassionally I borrow drawing paper,
pencil, tape, etc. from my
friends. At other times
I take paper, pencil, tape,
etc. from them. I have
been e~ected representative
of the IllS class. , I. did
, soiicit ' the votes before
th e election. However,
the 'work of a class
representative is not
defined well. (Pssst!
I hope it remains
undefined.) I need
hardly tell you how
much my parents
love me. They .claim
that I am as good
. as ten geniuses put
together. It is p art1 y
true. The II year
morons call me Hardy
not the eminent
author, but the famed
Oliver Hardy. 'They tell
me :-' Mike, never bike, (you
can't), just hike P Goodbye, now;
I'm getting late for the parade. Time
to be rol1ing on.
