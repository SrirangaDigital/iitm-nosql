CAMPASTIMES

brush have been the result of involuntary
jerks as new dimensions in sound were
attained next door. But its all been worth~
while, for Jain's interest in jazz has greatly
multiplied; in fact, he's recently heard to
quite casually drop tongue-twisters like 'Ella
Fitzgerald' !

COMIC STRIP-

ARUN JAIN
. If, one night, just as you're. setting off
for an after~dinner stroll, you are shaken out
of your reverie by someone who approaches
you in what can only be called a sinister
combination of The Crawl and The Mexican
Shume~ don't be alarmed ~ it's only Jain
taking his digestive walk (he'd never walk fOl'
pleasure). If he further proceeds to thrust out
his hand, jerk his head back, shove his foot
forward (right hand-left foot) and laugh, don't
be alarmed-he is only greeting you. Some of
his older acquaintances have compromised by
adjusting themselves to his sequence of
movements, at the same time keeping a wary
eye on his left foot. A sensitive plant, he'd
no doubt be greatly hurt jf snubbed and
would turn away with a wounded, • O.K.,

He is' equally conspicous during the day
and can be spotted as the guy groping his
way along the HSB corridors with his dark
gags on. According to him as long as there
is light, • A gog is man's best friend: Someone
quite cattily suggested that he should sleep
with them on in case the sun shOUld peep out
in his dreams r
Come 4- o'clock and Jain locks himself
up in his room, dead to the world. No
amount of knocking disturbs him-mainly
because his radio is on so loud. Bitter
complaints and wrathful. glances have been
cast in his direction but his faith in loud music
remains unperturbed. Many a stroke of
Femi's (his Saraswathi neighbour) paint

First on the list of Jain's interests is Jeeves.
YOUl'S truly knows from bitter experience as
be was cornered the other day to go • halves •
on a new P.G.W. book. Riding has been
pursued with much doggedness and, though
grave doubts were cast. as It.e was seen off on
his maiden ride, last year, he has managed to
stay on the horse and has, contrary to popular
belief, turned out to be a medium~rare rider.
His exploits on his cycle have not been so
uneventful. One's mind reverts to that sunny
day when Jain had a head~on-or rather,
midriff-on-collision with a village woman
which led to some unsavoury remarks on her
part and a misunderstanding among the
male folk. Anyway, Jain came through. a few
words the wiser but unscathed.

Unlike his extra~curricular activities his
academic perf9.rmance has been very good
and he's been hitting an average • A'. When'
called upon to., he can pale the top~brass
• Crammers' to insignificance and turn up at
the exams looking like something out of Edgar
Allan Poe.

One does not see eye to eye on everything
he does, but, 6n the whole, Jain is a very .
likeable sort wit'll a natural flair to amuse; as
his friend Jeeyes would say • QueUe Vistas
Sans Viere' {m-which, I suspect, is only
why he likes himself so much t

Who cares
about your air travel?

iii

You do, of course. But so does BOAC-very much. BOAC has a worldwide
reputation for taking good care of its passengers. Each flight with BOAC
seems a new experience-because BOAC is never happy to stay the same
airline two days running. All the time, all over the world, its planes shine
brighter, its seats feel deeper" its food tastes better. BOAC Cares about
people-that's why people care about BOAC.
