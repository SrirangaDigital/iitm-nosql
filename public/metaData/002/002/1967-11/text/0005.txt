QUICK CROSSWORD

Examinations in IIT are not extraordinary,
n(>r the students who write them day-in and
day-out; but the interaction of these two
has produced unique results. Fundamental
to any investigation of the interaction of the
IITian and his milieu, is that great phenomenon responsible for the distinctive vitality
of our classroom lives-' the stooge acts '.
The term is self-explanatory but a definition
follows for those who are not tuned to the
local frequency. I A stoog~ . act is a :wo~d
or deed of exceptional stupIdtty, reflectmg a
mental age of 6 to 8, perpetuated on a fellow
human. designed to provoke a reaction in
the form of a word or deed of comparable
stupidity, reflecting a mental age of 4 to 6.'
The age limits are flexible but only on the
lower side.
The most widely performed one is
the production of sound and pain by
masterminding the collision of a projectile
with a front bench nut. Having been organically connected to the nut part of the collision
pair several times, I can vouch for the
intensity and the effectiveness of the sound
and the' pain in producing the desired
consequences. A normal guy would wait
for the end of the class before locating the
moron responsible for the act and try to
help him back into society, but who wants
to be normal anyway. Alliances are initiated;
pacts are sealed; the War is on. Files go UP.
heads take cover, fire is returned; pain is
shared; the act is on. Never having taken
to range-practice seriously. the chaps are
awful shots. More nuts are hit; more reta1ia~
tion ensues; a blood bath commences.
Then ...• a miscalculation; a cock eye;
a sucked target; a shell overshoots on to the
p1atform.; soars higher; hits the blackboard;
sometimes the man. Deathly quiet. Inner
jubiliation. Great expectations.
Being more normal, the man on the platform
doesn't return fire and, thank God, he
doesn't; for, if he did, he could cause havoc
with his unlimited supply of ammunition.
Instead, he delivers a harangue on how
we will be engineers in a few years and how
we must grow up and things like that. He
doesn't stir a conscience nor enlighten a soul
for he is up against a grass roots lIT
occurrence-the stooge act.
A timely jab in the ribs when the neighbour
is talking to the lecturer, can produce results
with high "entertainment content. Retaliation
will come but who cares, that's half the
show. Then there are the routine cases of
vanishing glasses and slippers. of restless
fingers and of itching feet.
Stooge acts are, by no means, confined to
the classroom. Can a man and his nature
ever separate? . On Saturday evenings, after
a whole week's contact with the Cenvironment "
congregated under a topless roof, exposed to
the scintillating caresses of nature, resonating
with a thousand throbbing hearts, every
IlTian sheds his last veneer of normalcy and
here on display is the total outcome of the
interaction between man and his 'world'
in IIT-his neuroses, his geniuses, his
frustrations, and his P,I's. The biggest act
of buffoonery in the world is better witnessed
than described.
For ages, men have been searching for an
elixir to jump back from old age to you tho
We, here, obsessed as we are with fundas,
have gone to the root of the problem. We
have evolved a simple ritual for jumping back
from youth to childhood. We have proved
that no man need grow up, who does not
wish to do so.
