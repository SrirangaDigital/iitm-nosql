Letter to the Editor
A NOTE OF DISSENT
Dear Sir,
I hope you will be kind enough to publish
this criticism of the synopsis of the discussion
on regionalism etc.

f;DITORIAL
Having dispensed with a major issue the
Terminal examination, the IITian, nat~rally
wishes to sit back. But, with the Inter-IIT
Meet not very far off, our Institute's performance in the field of sports in retrospect is
worthy of scrutiny. The review would definitely show that our potentialities as sportsmen far exceed our achievements. This is the
time when our sportsmen should put their
best efforts into the game-free as we are
from academic hindrances. The captains of
• the team.s ar.e optimistic about Our performance, Judgmg from our record in inter. collegiate matches this year. Team spirit and
enthusiasm should help us to come up to the
mark at least this year.
The inclusion of cultural activities in the
programme should help to make the Meet a
fuller and more satisfying experience. Surely
the debates, quizzes, etc., added to the Mee~
~ill more than justify the extra expenditure
Involved. Two or three of the IIT Directors
did favour such an inclusion. We hope that
the proposal will be implemented as soon as
possible.

The very first sentence is highly illogical.
If making an Indian language the link language
is unfair to the majority, is not giving a foreign
language that position unfair to a much
bigger majority? In a multilingual society
such as ours, it is rational and sensible to
use as link language the one known to as many
as possible.
The masses do not require a link language
-indeed! This approach is remarkably that
of a detestable snob who has nothing but
contempt for his fellow countrymen. It is
such talk, more than anything else, which
harms the case for English. How can the
people be expected to listen to a set of
persons declaring in all seriousness that a
large majority of them do not require a link
language? One ~an only feel sorry fat' people
who are so completely out of touch with
reality.

number of literatl! persons is many times the
nun:b~r of t~ose' who k~ow English. If the
partiCipants In the semInar believe that the
literate have English as their link language
they are either very ignorant or very much
given to day-dreaming. They seem to have
confused literacy with knowledge of English.
It is very unfortunate that the participants
have done exactly what they warn others not
to do-bringing in sentiments and personal
and petty thoughts when dealing with national
issues. Our proficiency in a language and/or
our love for it should never blind us to the
larger interests of the nation. .
Tb~ other conclusions are noteworthythe one .advocating restraint in the
mtroducuon of regional languages in higher
education. One wishes, however that more
attention, had been paid to the problems of
staff-student relationship, to the solution of
which the participants could have been expected to make worthwhile contributions. Uttering
well worn platitudes will not solve the
problems.

Though; ~e stentors are free to' hold their

The easy beginning of a new term reminds

into the sWlmmmg pool. It is a pity that
the work done by the Nee cadets last year
and that of other volunteel'S, has not bee~
rewarded by the completion of the pool.
That we have the means, the materials and

THE CASE OF THE POISONER-COOK
• A most curious affair, Holmes,' I said,
Closing the paper and shaking my head.
He was, as usual, smoking a pipe
And gave me a smile with meaning ripe.
, Read the paper and tell me the history
Of what is called the Alaknatzda Mystery.'
• Four students,' I began, • have been sent
To the hospital with the stamp .. urgent. II
• The sam bar has been declared suspect
the Law is out the cook to get!
Said Holmes to me, , All's not said and done
This came while you were on your morning
run.'
A~d

He gave me a letter with profound glee.
What do you make of it?' asked he.
• Nothing at all I '-What could I say?
'Tis tough to copy his discerning way.

C

• This paper,' said he, • is full of meaning.
Written with the left hand, for a beginning.
Also, the man is a cook by profession,
And meeting me tonight does seem his
obsession.
• This cook,' Holmes said, • was in a
hurry.
Don't you see the mark of the curry ?
That shows he's a cook, beyond all doubt
And he will be here before day is out.
'
I That he's a lefty is shown by this ink·
And here he is now,' said Holmes with a
wink.
Both of us heard a knock at the door,
And now a man shuffied across the clean
floor.

« Good sirs,' said he,

help me you must.
The students, they're swearing they'd turn
me to dust.
I

I'm a good cook~ well known for my soups.
And have testimonials from big men and
dupes.'
• We shall certainly come,' Sherlock Holmes
I
boomed,
Not knowing (or knowing?) the danger that
loomed.
The poor man departed, his cheeks wet with
tears.
And we went there next day to allay his fears.

, The students will be back,' he called out
to us,
.
And suddenly kicked up a row and a fuss.
• I made this poison • • • er • • • er • • •

I cooked it and cooked it and made it

Holmes took it from his hand and vehemently
drank.

Ha t said the scoundrel) , My work here is
done.
Professor Moriarty can have all his fun.'
Holmes got to his feet, and spat at the
skunk;
,;
The rascal grC\';; pale and knew he was
sunk.
e I knew this,' said Holmes, with a wink
and a smile.
And before speaking further, relaxed for a
while.
l His acting did give me the required clue,
And when he. said co poison ", away my
doubts flew.
Arrest him; MacGregor 1 '-for he too had

• Now comes the other big case On page one.'
