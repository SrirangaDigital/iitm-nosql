CAMPASTIME·S
CARICATURE

M,. S. ehanaramouli
If you were to stand ill front of the Krishna
Hostel and yell C What ho I' yeiu' would .
naturally expect an answering c. What ho .r'
But when you hear a series of C What ho's I
emerging from the top floor then yoU: are sure
that it is no echo. The' What ho' I '-er is a
character whose .looks are similar to Wodehouse in every respect except perhaps ill
appearance. This is M. S. 'Elvis' Chandramouli whose hero-worship .for two opposite
characters like P. G. Wodehouse and Elvis
presumably has made him what he i!l at
present (?)
Being a sporting chap he never refuses to
sing when called upon (this is rare)-'-usually
after debates. The gyrations of Elvis Presley
would seem like a gently swaying Hula in
comparison with ' Elvis' Mouli. The series
of contortions he undergoes would remind us
of a firewalker whose feet have been badly
burnt. The queer high pitched sounds emanating from him immediately set an Applied
Mechanics expert in calculating the natural
frequency of the building to prevent failure.
It is usual for Elvis Presley fans to yell
• Crazy, Man, Crazy' but here they probably
mean Mouli.

Letters to the Editor
Rise in Price
. 1 am pleased to see that you are no longer
the . lousiest zO P. 'rag mainly because you
are now in the 2S P. bracket.
PETER FRANCIS LOBO.
Capt.
Campastimes has reached a new 'high'mainly the extra S P. in price I The rest of
it hit the same old low II
SURESH N. SHENOY.
I know that many people will complain
but I'm glad you raised your price. In fact,
I wish you'd raise it more and more. Then
it will reach a price where I can no longer
afford to buy it, and I'll have a chance. to
grow up normal and healthy instead of becoming a raving lunatic (like you).
SANTOSH (Pop) NAYAK.
As far as I'm concerned, you can raise the
price to a buck and I still won't buy it.
YATIN R. VORA.
[How come all four of you laid your hands
on Lhe same issue of Mad Magazine ?-Ed.]
Sir,
Your last issue was flat, insipid, and a few
other unmentionable things. To put it in a
word, it was TRASH. No poems, no limericks, not even a teeny-weeny article by S.
Ramajayam. If this sort of thing persists, I
will refuse to subscribe any further.
Yours etc.,
LOCAL.

THE PRELUDE
My days of repose have come to ' an end,
I know.
.
The din that I hear informs me it's .time lor
woe'
.
While de~p in my inner spirit are voices
which urge me away.
.
Fr?m the hateful sequel of that music with
Its one more round of ten more rustic
tUlles that mar this day.

THE SONG
Our quads are alive with the sourid of
• music'
Which throb in my head while I'm reading
Sears.
Those cl4morous songs which should make
even you sick.
Are bursting the drums of my anguished,
ears.
My heart wants to beat like the wings of
the birds and escape to. the quiet of the
trees,
For I'm forced to give ear to each tune
thrice a day as it floats on the breeze.
The radios and players arc streaking my
hair with a premature gray j
To. sleep through the night I have ne'er had
a chance to this day.
I sing to. myself when my 'heart feels
burdened,
To crowd out those so.unds that I've heard
befereSo. at last when I'm deaf to the sound of
music
I will sing no mOre.

An avid reader, he laps up all types of-books
but has a special affection for Wodehouse and
Karl Marx. It has been said of Churchill that
he could recite • The Lays of Ancient Rome'
without an error but Mouli could probably
repeat 'Carry on, Jeeves' along with the
foreword. His admiration for Marx increased
when he found out the meaning of the first
word in Da$ Capital during the course of
the German Lectures in the II year. Henceforth everybody was his comrade and he was
seriously thinking of going on a mission to
canvas the Formosans. But the Chinese invasion made him return to the capitalist fold.
With his wit and swagger he could probably beat Casanova hollow but he is very
shy in feminine company. He is so theatrical
that one very rarely knows when he is acting
and when he is not. Once a visitor to one of
the drama rehearsals in which Mouli was
taking part could not differentiate between the
actual rehearsal and the rest period in. between.
His love for Campastimes has earned him the
Tamil nickname of Paper Kara.
Reading all through one is apt to think that
he is an undesirable in Society. But on the
contrary, it is such chaps who help deviate
this world from the part of monotony. He is
the Krishna Hostel Shuttle Captain at pre·
sent. (This is actually top secret.) He
probably doesn't know I

into history than '62.)

Going one up on the Indian Railways, a
member of our illustrious Staff applied a
literal transform to solve a persistent problem
for many IITian lecturers:
Less luggage
Less verbiage
More comfort
More facts
Make travel a pleasure. Make correction a
pleasure.

(And the editorial board got its kicks too, in

Sorry!
We regret to announce that not a single
correct entry was received for last time's
crossword, The Square Dance. Hence nobody
gets the handsome prize, which, incidentally,.
was a free trip to Europe.

The Fly in the Soup
.We all know the case of t.he drowning fly

he smells the squeezed fly, grunts C sayspose I
whadyucaU eat this Aam gonna do the whadyucall Svaals in the smission and prodical

Urdu V. Mohindru: Drinks gths of the
soup, calls the waiter and points out the fly.
Krook K. Batra: Takes along a handful of
dead flies in his pocket and slyly drops one in
(after slogging ~ths).
V. P. S. A. R. J. Nadar alias Jack alt'as
Kattan : Calls the head waiter and shaking
his head, and unruilling his hair asks with a
demanding air, why they want to cheat him
with only one fly.
,Sir R. Tuttipa ,: Seeing the fly floating,
watches it carefully for five minutes and mut·
ters, Ha, fly, fly, fly, yes, fiy, soup, fly, yes
