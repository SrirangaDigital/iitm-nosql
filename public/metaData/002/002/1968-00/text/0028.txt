Why':beat"around' the bush, we will get to
the point right away . This is the story of
two young 'men, 'WhO" are a"piring to be
engineers. As with all .other final year boys,
they are; also stuck -with a project. From now
on, we will let them do the talking directly.
, • I am told we have to do a prujl!ct this
year, yar. Thrilling,' what? · WE design,
WE make the decisions. Now that is what I
call education," said Chaman.
• It will be fun,' admitted Vanky.
And soon enough, the projects were
announced. Chaman and Vanky were grouped
togethe~ to design :3 Still Mill. Halt million
ton capacity, to be located at Timbuktoo.
~, Oh. no I Not Him/: groaned Chaman.
'Had it,' thought Vanky with a feeling of
despair.
Having started with such a deep sense of
under,standing for each other, one could
see they would reach a new height. Explore
new horizons. They would nut do the
norinal, routine thing-thinking, reading pertinent . literature, consulting their guide etc.
No, they, would .be different. And believe
me, they were. They started by talking.
They had obviously read Ho'\}l to Win Friends
etc.
, I say, all jokes aside, we will make a fine
job of it.' said Yank with a smile which had
nothing. behind it ,put teeth. (I still .don't
see what chances t have with him around.)
• Ja, . Ja we will -lick ,'em,' said Chaman
diplomatically• . (We will never get started.
Not a chance.)
,
'.
'And 1 .got relatives down there in' Timbuktoo. Tliey can help-like surveying the sight,'
offered Vanky.
'There I We already got a lead. We will
get it hound in real style, black leather cover,
gold letters-the complete works,' agreed
Chaman.
Vanky rememb~red. sQmething. «Talking
o~ bindmg reminds me. We must first get it
lyped, man. And typing is vel y expensive.
Fifty paise per page. That is a' lot of
money.'
'
, Don't worry. I can type, I used to make
paper name plates for ' my bocks 011 my pop's
typewriter. I can borrow a typewriter,'
(~xplained Chaman. '"
Vanky was deligl).t~d. 'I knew we two
would click. Thef"say marriages are made
in H~aven. I say all partnerships are made
1n Heaven. You will do the typing then.'
Cham an could exploit the situation as well
as the m:xt guy. 'Fail" enoug'1. You do the
work and I will do th~ typing. We will go
halvers on the cost of the paper.' ..
\
Vanky still aid not see rig"t: 'You got
yourself a deal,' he said, satlsfi'·d.
To reach this stage, our friends had taken
about three week~. Meanwhile, the other

fellows were doing the usual things. They
were working. reading, calcu1ating~ and
drawing.
'
But Vanky knew when and where to draw the
line. 'I have always believed in one thing.
If the work can be postponed. drop it. Notice
I say ~ if' and' can '. Well, it can no longer
be postponed. We must get started. Now,
what is it they want at Timbuktoo ? '
One could see that Chaman was embarrassed. 'I am afraid••.• .'
C Nothing
to be scared of, yar. The
procedure is standardised. We will manage,'
assured Va~·.ky.
, Let me finish, you mutt. I am not afraid
of that. I think I have lest the problem! '
Vallky was positively t«ken aback. His
eyes popped out because of the shock. He
thundered just as soon as Chaman had put
them back in the sockets. C You moron! How
could you? We had it! Doomed. Do you
hear? Doomd. That project is worth 100
marks I'
'Aw, c'mon. Dont sound so desperate.
We know it is a steel mill. All these mills
h~ve a blast furnace. We can safely design
one.'
. Cham an did not but Vanky saw the snag in
this otherwise brilliant suge;estion: mainly
which blast furnace to have. Vanky told him.
'Fear not. I will think of s~mething,'
assured Cham an.
.
'And he did, two days later. C While I look
for the problem, we can decide about the
general features of the mill, Canteen, cyclestand, common-foom etc.
Vanky was impressed. • I say you got
helluva point there. Why didn't I think of
that. Let us work this evening.' ., .'
, N,it today. yar. I am going : for a movieKiss Kiss. Kill Kill. Full of action. We will
start tomorrow.'
But then Vanky was a busy man also. • I
~m g ling for Tiger Agent Prefers Dynamite.
That's where the action is I'
That wa!l ten days bac~. Since then, they
have decided . on a number of things. They
have agreed on the number of watchmen and
even the bus timings. But the path to a steel
mill is not all smooth. Fer example, they
do not see eye to eye on th~, important matter
of iccwcreams. Chaman feels Chec Bars
must be available ' in ,the canteen. But not
Vanky. The quality is so poor, he feels they
are Siwck Bars. Elsewhere in this Campastimes, ,they have asked for public opinion.
They a.,sure us the matter will receive their
most serious consideration.
As for the Steel Mill, that will come just
:IS sonn as the problem is found.
But by
Jove, they tell us, Timbuktoo WIll have its
Steel Mill-onlyon paper!

A SWEET BUNCH', OF KIDS
• They're the sweetest bUnch of kids I've
known.'
'What? I'
• Honest, Dad.'
'So you've been taken in by their sick
grins,'",
, Feeling malicious, aren't you ?'
'Okay, 1 won't say anything. Let's hear
about it.'
.
,
'Well, I bounced in feeling nervy as hell.
Them folks were wearing their ' best smiles.
A couple of "Present Sirs" jolted me. Then
not a squeak out of them while I
lectured.'
, Did you dare to look at them?'
«Natch,'
, Bored expressions?'
, I've never seen a more attentive set.'
, Attentive to what, I wonder .... Nvone
sleeping in the last bench ? ' '
'Nope.'
« Wait till the novelty wears off.'
'Dad, I think I'll ahvays love teaching.
No chance of me getting .' .. ,' .
, No, no, no, no, not that. ' I mean, the
riovelty of a beautiful lady lecturer.'
, Hey Pop, you mean them guys don't give'
a hang about Eco? They're just being
interested ' 'cause I'm a woman and ·that ·sort
of thing? '
• You're getting bright, l'i'l gal.'

'What ?'
