CAMPASTIMES

!Aa~ ~~~1,

~~~~l§j~~~~~

This now is our second issue of Campastimes,
yes, • our' issue and, unfortunately, still not
, yours' I We had thought it was sufficient
that word went round, lIT Madras were to
publish its own newspaper. • A monthly,
bah l' 50 what? It's still a newspaper, isn't
it? And with some sort of a future, we hope.
But hope is all we can at present, because
it's only a matter of a very short time that
the handful of those who make Campastimes
now, will leave the Institute with • B.Tech.'
written all over their front and back. And then
what? Well, that's precisely what we keep
asking ourselves.
We know, not everyone of you is a writer
of sorts, not everyone is able to put his thoughts
on paper, 1\ot everyone is an artist. But do
you, in all seriousness, want us to believe that
there are no more than can be counted by the
fingers of less than two hands who are capable
and willing to contribute to Campastimes ?
Do you want us to believe that there is not
one in I Year who has the ghost of a literary
vein? Or-are you, by any chance-shy? Oh,
come!
Campastimes No. 2 has eight pages. Not
because-in spite of you 1 But how long do you
think can a few fellows fill eight pages every
month without your contributions and suggestions? And-let's not forget-your criticism?
Or do you want us to splash • Space Donated
by Tom, Dick & Harry, Ltd.' all over six
pages? Hardly attractive, don't you agree?
Well, there you are.
So, let's have a sample of what you know
besides B.Tech. After all, it's • your' newspaper and not only • ours'.
Yours etc.

and a

frielld are sitting on a ledge. Some01le comes out. (
Higgins: Look at him, a pris'ner of the gUtter, condemned by
all those who mutter, • By right he should be taken out and sh?t !or
the lousy mess in which he's left the pot.' (A lomld from w:thzn).
Heavens, what a stink I
This is what the local population refers to as hygienic education.
Friend: Come, Sir, I think you pi~ked a poor :~?,ample..
Higgins: Did I? See them down In lIT, Tapltl or Godavan ..
Leaving bathrooms anyway they like.
(Someone else comes out) I say. you've pulled the chain, I hope.
Reply: Vart you take me for. a dope?
Higgins: No one taught him what that chain was really for.
In Narmada it's worse
You may even need a hearse;
I'd rather use the Buckingham Canal.
Pigs living in the gutter
Just like this one.
Sound from within: S.plutter.
..
HiggitlS: I ask you Sir, what sort of hfe.ls ~at.?
It's lack of common decency that keeps h1m 1D hiS place.
Not his deadened sense of smell and corny face.
Why can't the Indians ~each their children. how to flush?
This squalor .we adore IS apt to make a sador blush.
If you behaved as he does, Sir, instead of the way you do,
, Why, you might be a ruddy Pig too.
Friend : I beg your pardon, Sir 1 .
.
.
Htggins: An Indian's sense of hygiene absolutely classifies him•.
The moment he uses a bathroom, he makes some other Indian
despise him.
A clean mode of living I'm afraid we'll never(get.
Oh, why can't the Indians ....... .learn to ........ set a good
example,
To people whose habits are painful to your nose.
It sickens all outsiders, I suppose.
There are even places where cleanliness completely goes.
The ground floor guys don't count it among their woes.
Why can't the Indians teach their children how to flush?
Norwegians, Greeks and Scotsmen always make the water gush.
In France they'll yank the thing even when they have to rush.
The French don't care if no water comes, actually, as long as they
pull the chain.
But tell these guys to do it; You're regarde~ as. insane:
Arabians use perfumes to make the whole affatr a I1ght thtng.
The ancient Hebrew idea was an absolutely bright thing.
Why can't the Indians - - why can't the Indians pull ....
the .... chain ?

One of the new machines in the hydrometric~ laboratory is a progr~mmed universal pedicyclode. Employing tandem numerical control Untts, fully automated Jl~ contour generator,
reversing tesseract stator, and a ring field rated at 200 ~w, the apparatus weighs 2! tons and was
designed entirely by the personnel of the hydrometries laboratory. The power system was
installed by Bessling Industri:l.l Corp. At present, a research ~eam. led by Professor Kornie
Scoeffer is engaged in finding out what exactly the corny contraptlon 1S supposed to do.
