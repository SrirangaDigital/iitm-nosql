VIJAY REDDY

fllall .. ~f.h!~~

Its about a year now since Vijay Reddy
started brewing those delicious little cups of
tea. Each little cup had a different flavour,
but none has tasted flat.
One publications committee after another
has tried to outdo itself in the pursuit of
humour. Successive editors of Campastimes
have hunted wit and laughter with missionary
zeal like Galahads after the Holy Grail.
Th;y missed the whole point. Humour can
be forced. And when they couldn't find the
genuine stuff they settled for less and filled
the iag with mongrel wit and sick humour ..
. . . • the sicker the better. Editors have come
and editors have gone, with the fond belief
that the lIT ian must be dished out jokes and
more jokes and nothing more but jokes. The
assumption is that the average clod over
here can appreciate nothing else. Pardon
the long digression, but Vijay Reddy has
time 'and again nai~ed tl,Us l.ie with h,is 'cup'.
'By no stretch of Imagmatlon can his column
be called hilarious ..•. in fact it is a little
(only a wee little) pontifical. But it captures
the reader's mind with its sense of timing,
uncompromising forthrightness and apt simile
(remember the one about ostriches ?).
There are gentlemen who sneer superciliously that .they dont care for the serious
criticism and thinly veiled sermonising' over
a cup' . Yet, in a deep recess of their
thick skulls, even they, I'm sure, cannot help
-but admire the honesty and conviction that
concocts Vijay's column, and the strikingly
effective language in which it is dished out.
Vijay's 'cup' has always provided drink for
-thought. It has been the saving grace of a
couple of otherwise mediocre issues.

Now to come to grips with the subject
'proper. It is difficult to write anything
funny about Vijay. There is no nonsense
about him.
He is quiet, unassuming and patient.
Genero~sly endowed with grey matter, he is
-a topper in class and an excellent sportsman ..
•.. he plays tennis and T. T. and was a
member of the rowing team that went to
Ceylon. Vijay is deeply interested in nuclear
~ngineering, and right now he is constructing

an • Atom Smasher' with Dutta and Kimbo.
A true all-rounder, there are very few things
he cannot do (like tying his lungi properly).
Tall, lanky and gangly, he is a living proof
that Adam really swallowed the apple in a
hurry. Guys in class sometimes wipe their
inky hands on his mop of hinky hair. Thammanapalli Narayana Reddy Vijayanarayana
Reddy hails from Patagonia.
Ramani Swamy insists that Vijay once tried
to kill him with poisoned mutton puffs.
Knowing Ramani as I do, I wish Vijay had
tried a little harder. However there is evidence to show that Vijay is a warmly human
creature. He once decorated his room
(which badly needed decoration) with a fish
tank. However he soon found out that tending fish was a trifle tedious. So with a sad
heart he gathered his pets in a jar, took them
all the way to the river and with loving care
released them. So that the poor mites could
tide over their acelimatisation period he
dropped a week's ration of fish feed after
them. He came back to Tapti and hogged
fish curry for dinner without batting an
eyelid.
Vijay has a polite way of saying goodnight
to nocturnal guests. Just before going to bed he
always brushes his teeth. If it's past bedtime
and the conversation shows no sigh of flag~
ging, he pulls out his toothbrush, applies
paste and starts brushing in situ. The hint is
invariably taken.
You can get to know Vijay better by reading in between the lines of 'cup', then by
reading this apology for a ' caricature '.

In retrospect, one sadly wonders whether
Vijay's brilliant, bubbling cups of tea have
been wasted on those for whom they were
intended. The C kattans 'at OAT are still
going strong with their antics and orange
peels; the ostriches have dug their heads in
deeper; the two oafs at the Gajendra circle
continue to change colours; Knick-Knack's
menu still flatters the fare and mocks the
purse. Sometimes, in exasperation and
despair one wishes for a cup of tea that not
only scolds but really scalds.

On
Happiness

TODAY I was very happy. I'll tell you
why. I found a cockroach in class. If
you go to class you can find a cockroach too.
That is if you sit in the back benches and
searcb. You have to search hard. But it
works. So I found a cockroach.
I pht it in my pocket.
If you have a shirt. And if it has a pocket.
And if you go to class. And sit in the back
bench. And find a cockroach. Yo~ can put
it in your pocket too.
It flln up and down in my pocket. This
madel me happy. I looked down with interest. The lecturer saw me. He saw me
look with interest in class. So he became
happy. My neighbour saw the lecturer. He
saw the le!!turer see me. He thought I was
caught. So he became happy.
Dopy saw the lecturer seeing the back
So he stopped
benches. He got scared.
looking at a picture. (It was his own picture.)
He looked at the blackboard instead.
The others saw Dopy looking at the board.
They were surprised. They thought there
was something about the lecturer on the
board. Something funny that he had not
seen. So they looked at the board. They
looked very interested. They were happy.
The front bench saw the lecturer looking
at us. So they looked at us. They saw us
looking at the board. They thought that
maybe they had missed something. So they
looked at the board and copied everything
dow1)o again. This made them happy. One
blok~ copied everything down again twice.
He was a thorough bloke. This made him
very happy.
The middle benches did not look anywhere.
That is because they were benenes. Benches
don't have eyes. So they can't look--there .

happy.
The cockroach started nibbling my shirt.
This made him happy. He liked the taste.
Besides, he was hungry. For his mess grub
was bad.
The lecturer saw the whole class looking at
the board. He sawall of us looking interested.
He was very happy. He hopped about on one
hand. Then he gave all of us attendance.
And let us off. He even switched the fans off
himself.
We all became happy.
AlI but the cockroach. He had bitten a
piece of soap in my pocket. It was N.C.C.
soap. He choked and died.
But that does not matter.
F,or we were all happy. I went home
an<~: had a bath. And became more happy.
The blokes in the front bench went home
and copied everything again. They missed
their grub to do this. So they became happy.
The others in the middle benches came back
from the pictures. They heard they got free
attendance. So they became more happy.
--AU because of the cockroach .

Moral: If you wear a shirt. And if it
has a pocket. Apd if you go to class. And
if you find a cockroach. Remember to put
it in your pocket.
