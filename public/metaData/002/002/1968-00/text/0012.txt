CARICATURE

SUDARSAN
The proud clan of the Penubolus have had
to put up with many a hardship ever since
they migrated to Madras in 1876. But the
greatest calamity that hit them was in the year
1946, when Penubolu Balagurumurthy Sudarsan Chettiar (I) descended upon this earth.
People have laid claims to have been born
with a variety of appliances - - a silver
spoon in the mouth, for example; but Sudarsan, in his freshman evidence before the
learned Seniors, beat them all. The bloke
came into this world with a set of rippling
muscles. Which explains why. in an age
when lesser men are known to have sought to
ventilate themselves at the bare mention of
< pants', Sudarsan got away with a hundred
buskies and fifty push-ups. This enthusiastic
voluntary demonstration (' My usual daily
exercise, anyway' he claimed later), one
would expect, should have helped establish a
certain rapport with the seniors, had Sudarsan
not decided to delve into the deeply religious
issue, with D. V. Singh,. as to who should be
visiting whom in hospital,
Ever since that day, this nadir of the
Penubolu clan has refused to let his bubbling
congenital energy and wit be dampened by
time, tide or the periodicals.
He took to the debating rostrum with a
passion and an emotional involvement second
only to that of the inimitable Sir Venky
Kotpath. And his Sf 3" frame was no bar.
Where Kacker thumps the table and surveys
the audience to determine where exactly the
difference lies, Sudarsan seeks to emphasise
his point by jumping up - - in the innate
Orang-UtalL style - - behind the podium,
giving the audience an opportunity to' locate
the source of such unbecoming noises. In
the years gone by, Sudarsan has aped Western
manners, banned the bomb, blasted Christine
Keeler and Engish politics (' She pulls out a
drawer and the whole cabinet falls') at Kharagpur, and, more recently, embraced the loop.
His acrobatics on the stage are marked by
similar zest and bounce, skipping (1) in
clerical robes (II) with Gope ( ! ! I'), modelling the minilungi; or discoursing alternately
in radhur prophsent Sardarji Ingleece and
chaste Chenn Temizh, on the ghumi adi
executed by the paithyam (muttal would have
been more appropriate) in the I.C. engine;
chirping in from the announcer's booth
between the acts to ensure that the audience
is thoroughly bored.
On the sports field, however, his attitude
is distinctly fatherly towards other creatures,
who, he feels, would be performing a great
national service .by staying in their rooms.

He is particularly irrepressible on the volleyball court, bellowing away every now and
then: 'Stop banging the ball, finger it ! '
And the haven of such recluses, Cantpastimes, has accepted this specimen with unconcealed glee. With sickontributions like
'Jesuspend your blabominable twinterlocutions .... ' , 'litter lcks', sexetera for which
the Editor sexpressed himself most profiligated), Sudarsan has provided ample spoof
of the aboriginality of his sinventive mind.
Yet, his greatest scoop in this field has been
the publication of the EME Camp newspaper, Aaram So; a task to which he devoted
himself with such invigorous zeal and
irrepressible enthusiasm, along with Mahajan
(who else 1), that they brought the issue out
just in time on the last day - - even though
they had to romp all over town, or stay at
home to do so. Even Pilot Officer Sankaran
did not fail to be properly impressed, when
on his usual midnight inspection he dis-·
covered that our friend was away on Aaram
So work.
There hardly seems to be a pie in this
Campus without Sudarsan's stubby finger in
it. And organisation is his forte. The
countless successes of the Institute's cultural
activities are due, in no small measure, to
him. About the only , extrawcurricular •
activity to which he has not taken kindly is
his studies 1

P. J. Session
HERE are a few P.J.s that I think you must hear.
First, a few cracks that you can use on those guys who pester you
about the exam you'd rather forget. The method is quite foolproof.
I have used it with total success and assure you that if you use all the
cracks mentioned, the guy won't bother you for years. And it is my
guess that you play not ev~n haye to use all of them.
The conversation goes like th1s.
The inquisitive bimbo: 'How was the paper? '
You, the' wise cracker: I It was white and had things printed on it'.
Bimbo: 'You have mistaken me. I mean, was it tough?'
You: 'Yeah. I couldn't fold it with even both my hands.'
Bimbo: • Was it long? '
You: 'Yeah. About fourteen inches, I should think. And before
you ask me, it was eight inches broad and eleven microns thick.'
Bimbo: (Persistent) 'I mean, how did you find it ?'
You: 'That was no problem. Nobody hid it. It was there on
the table.'
Bimbo: (one last attempt) I How did it go?'
You: 'It didn't go no place. The guy snatched it after two hours.'
That ought to settle any Bimbo. If you meet a Bimbo that is too
persistent, let me know. I'll avoid him.

on the theory of the Helium
atom.
One day, as I was walking past the post office, I saw an electron
making a phone call. As soon as it finished and replaced' the receiver
on the hook, twenty Paise fell out of the box. The electron took
the money and calmly walked out. I, who sawall this, could not
believe my eyes. I rail to the electron and said, 'Hey electron, how
come the dough fell out when you made the call?' The electron gave
an enigmatic smile and said, 'Come with me to Knick Knack, and

A veritable genius, this man! That is, if

Early indications were not lacking. In fact
at the very age of six, he set his Principal
and his teachers to consulting volumes on the
juvenile manic~depressive tendencies (whatever that means) associated with kleptomania.
Of late, of course, Sudarsan has cultivated
these impulses to a degree that has won the
admiration of eminent psychoanalysts of
Mr. Govindarajan's calibre - - and the
indignation of his wing-mates. (It is worthless to investigate. You find yourself baulked
by a sturdy 10 pounds lock of Kharagpur
ancestry.) Though, perhaps, his most dangerous relapse occurred in an open-book
periodical, when he handed in his notes and
walked out with the answer papers I
Yet his honesty is not to be doubted. In
fact, his immense popularity with a wide
range of students (Daloyes, Wads, and Salamis
alike) not to forget the one and only triple
poinF, is probably more due to his deeply
religious sense of justice and fair play, and
his inoral courage, than to his brains, brawn,
or organisational skill.
Speaking about his muscles, he claims that
his long-standing challenge to any four persons on this Campus to catch him and give
him'1' bumps' is yet to be accepted. Strong

we'll talk it over there.' The electron ordered a hamburger and coffee
for the two of us, and quietly ate the stuff. Soon the meal was over,
and the waiter came and gave the electron Rs. 02.3.0. 'What about the
tip,' barked the electron. The waiter apologised and gave the electron
twenty·five Paise and said that that was a ten per cent tip. The
electron seemed quite happy. Before I could ·ask the electron. my
question, we had finished a fat lunch at Gaylords which brought the
electron Rs. 18 with the tip. I was really confused. I pleaded, ' Don't
torment me like this, tell me what all this is about. How come people
pay you for your pleasures?'
The electron called a taxi, put me in it and told the driver to drop
me in lIT. The driver coughed up Rs. 7.so.for the fare. At, the cab

Now I know what holds the Helium atom in one piece. Don't
believe the guys who talk about covalent bonds. It's actually two rich
electrons feeling sorry for a bankrupt Alpha particle, which, as you
can readily guess, was cleaned out of its cash, being doubly charged on
each occasion•••
If you found the story confusing the first time, read it again.
Chaps have brought out a theorem of (N-x) friends. The theorem
states that if vou have a vehicle of N wheels, the number of friends
you are guaranteed is (N-I). The proof is given by induction stunts.
Mandip Singh lucidly demonstrated the validity for N equals two when
he bluffed he had sold his scooter.
Mimani proved the validity of the theorem for N equals four when
he acquired three new friends over the week-ends, when his uncle's car
came on Saturday. What do you do when the car has four wheels
but happens to be very small? • Use small friends,' says T.T.J., to
prove the theorem.
