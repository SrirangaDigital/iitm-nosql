Psychology Study Circle :
There was a group discussion on I-I-70 in
which representatives from all the city colleges took part.
The topic:
The Post-Freudian A1uzlysis of Parag1lOstic
Ego-drifls i,i the Retroactive Sublimatio7' of
the Attentionitis Drive-or Wily Girls Wear
lIfi"iskirts. Hemline data sheets were distributed by the Secretary. A monograph
prepared by Sri N. U. T. Shrinker was
released. It comprised a detailed historical
survey of the development of the mini from
Palaeolithic times, with special notes on topics
such as C the grass skirts of the Upper Congo',
• the Generation Gap', c the Exposure
Threat " and C the Panic in the Textile Industry , • A resolution ~v~s I;'assed saying that
girls should not wear minIskirts. (They look
better without them.)
Dispute:
The Outdoor Club Secretary alleged here
yesterday that some members of the Art Club
had illegally removed the Outdoor Club's
canvases, tent-poles and kitchen utensils. No
modern art exhibition, he asserted, justifies
this sort of vandalism. Besides, in the place
of tent canvas, the members of his Club have
to use lungis with psychedelic patterns on
them and that hardly looks becoming. Last
week '3 group of villagers from Koddlaipidungur attacked an Outdoor Club expedition
camping near the village for just this very
reason, he said.

Radio Club:
Tenders are invited for the supply of a 2 pf
ceramic capacitor to the Radio Club. Tender
application forms can be had from the Registrar, IIT, Madras, on payment of Rs. z each.

Opening lead: The

of Clubs.

East wins the lead and continues with a Club which is ruffed by West•. West leads a'
small diamond which the declarer ducks in the Dummy. East wins with the King of Diamonds.Now it is time for East to think. From the bidding, South probably has a sbc~carder Spade. He
also has a four-carder Clubs. His ducking the diamond indicates a probable diamond doubleton
to a Queen. This leaycs him with a singleton Heart, which the declar~r obviously hopes to
discard on the Diamond Ace. There are 3 Spades in the Dummy, WhlCh means that West
probably has a singleton Spade. A Club continuation would therefore give the contract to the
declarer. It is also quite probable that West has the Heart Ace. otherwise the declarer would
not have ducked the Diamond small, knowing that a Club continuation can be ruffed. Hence
the propel' play for East is to switch to a Heart after winning the trick with the Diamond King.
Losing a probable Club ruff is not important as against giving up the game contract.
