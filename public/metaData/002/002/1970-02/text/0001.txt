'COMPUTER
Duriri.g'the Director's visitto West Germany
the aid agencies agreed in principle to supply
the Institute a full-fledged computer. In
all probability, the, computer will reach us
by the end of this year. It is a third
generation computer: size-medium to large.
This high speed computer will be the heart
of a computer Centre to be established at the
Institute. The facilities of the centre will be
made available to other educational institutions also'. The present estimate of the
computer's cost is about three to four million
DM. A decision is yet to be taken on the
make and type of computer to be installed.

WEST GERMAN DELEGATION VISITS THE INSTITUTE

REPUBLIC DAY
~;ight

and early one fine morning, a SUIprtsmg number of IITian Staff and students
converged on the stadium-to watch the NCC
at its tricks. Senior UO Venkatraman led
the first and second year cadets around the
uneven ground to his heart's content. The
unfurling of the flag, the national anthem
, played very loud, and commands barked in
the peculiar NCC lingo formed the prelude to
the Director's speech. Dr Ramachandran
observed that in spite of everything, it cannot
be denied that India HAD made considerable
P!ogress since independence. But it is high
time the leadership of the mediocrity gave
way to the leadership of the meritocracy if the
wants of the hungry millions are to be met.
Wealth must be created before it can be distributed ; to create wealth, everyone of
us must work-' work is worship '-and
instead of emphasising the differences among
the classes and sections of the nation it is
ti~e ",;fforts were made. to tighten the bo~ds of
umty mstead. • Long hve the Republic! ' And
awaY,went Senior UO Venkatraman leadinghi~
juniors round the course once more, and away
went the Security Officer distributing sweets
to all the little kids who had dropped in for a
bit of 'innocent fun.

A ,little noticed visit by a top-level delegation 'of German' bankers and industrialists
to' India marked a definite reinforcement of
general interest. in the national economy.
Among them, th~ m~mbers of the delegation
represented firms whlch own just about anything worth owning in West Germany. Never
before has such a delegation from Germany
visited a developing nation. They were here
to take stock of the investment climate and
also to gain' a first-hand impression of the
working of the three, hundredwand-odd IndoGerman collaborations all o'\'(r the country.
The foreign press is not considered a very
reliable Source of information on such
matters.
The four members of the delegation who
visited the Institute were all bankers. They

were given the usual red-carpet treatment:
official luncheon+a tour round the bearable
departmental sights +i1~ter'{)iew d 1a Campas~
timBS.
,
They ''tere of the opinion that the Institute
compared with the best in Germany. Not
unexpectedly, they were full of praise for the
achievements of the private sector undertakings in India. Too much planning, they
remarked, ,~ould be harmful to the economy.
I Ask not what we can do for you, but what
we can help you do for yourselves,' was the
suhstance of their comments on the lIubject of
further aid commitments. At this point our
news writer began to look desperate, so we
eased off on the questioIls and gracefully
made our exit.
