These things happen in the best regulated
families.
The second evening saw entertainment of
a 111,0re enjoyable variety put up. Playback
singers P. B. Sriniws and S. Janaki held the
audience with. their multilingual. songs;
Mr. Srinivas e~ded his repertoire with an
amusing venture into the realms of w.estern
musk. Professor Sam path came down on
both of them with resounding citations.
After this we saw a remarkable exposition
of some classical'dances of India by Kllmari
Pankaj Rao. AU in all, it was an evening
\;"ell spent.
. The third evening brought a drama by
~ Ashok Entertainers, lIT, -Madras', of the
Staff Club. Unlike their student counter~
parts, they tried to entertain. Fortunately the
large audience was composed mainly of the
Staff and tl:.eir Velacheri cousins, and no
indecorous vociferations took place.
