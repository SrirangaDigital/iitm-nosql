It was Diwali morning.
Breeze in
dazzling silk kurta was holding
stage on the first floor corridor.
Which means he had rolled up his
sleeves and candle in one hand
was lighting and tossing with the
other, with exaggerated casualness, 'oosi pattass':
piddly
crackers that make about as much
noise as a snake with tonsils.
On Diwali moriings, it is the
custom of some people from
civilisation to diop in here and
see how their wards are getting
along in Sing Sing and it is also
customary for sisters and aunts
to tag along for the ride.
Such
a

troupe had

landed

in Narmada,

swathed
in rustling silk,
clinking bangles and layers of
flowers.
Breeze saw them.
He
brightened.
This definitely
called for something hotter than
with
'oosi pattas', he felt.
mounting excitement, he tossed a
couple of lighted matchsticks
to set him on

the way.

The story of Breeze and the Bomb
has gone down in IIT lore as a classic
example of 'How Not To Lose Your
Head while Trying To Impress The
Opposite Sex'.

Their eyes settled

on our intrepid gunman.
A thrill shot through Breeze.
This was IT, he felt.
The big moment.
Very
very casually his hand
came up with, yes, a big fat
chocolate bomb.
A chocolate bomb,

you understand, is anything but
sweet.

The noise
