FOR
6253 IN THE EVENING
While the dusk darkened into night,
the cigarette ends glowed,

the lights came on,

and the noise in the room,

strangely silent,

whispered that it was time,
I was lost in a gypsy trail,
that meandered around you,
strangely passionless, poignant thoughts,
who suffocated me, the sheer intensity
who surprised me,

That
While
While
while
While
While
While

I'd never have realized,

the dusk darkened,
the noise grew strangely silent whisp ering,
illogical moves corroded the chess board
thoughts raced across the universe,
you who never thought of me ever,
you who never know me ever,

While you would be sitting 1000 miles away somewhere,

You affected me by your sheer beauty,
Thoughts flood back
She is a photograph,
Into nothingness.
Inpressionistie, why think?

Pealitu, as usual, acts the villain, and Cupid

You wait,

little lad, in the fresher stage

For Fate to turnthe

Your mind little lad is a vacant page
That many a fox would write.on.
THE ADVANCE

Sonny its time to think.
IIT life with hazards is rife
And you might be left to sink.
You are sixteen going on seventeen--
