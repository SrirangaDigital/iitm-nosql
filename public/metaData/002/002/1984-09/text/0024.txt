CAMPASTIMES

September 1984.

Seniors will fall in line.
Mystic experts and gastric perverts
May offer you grass and brine.
Totallw unprepared are you
For tortures in this den,

‘Timid and shy and scared are you
0f candles

lit at

ten.

You need 'guidance' from someone who'll
Tell you just what to do,
I am seventeen going on eighteen
I'll 'take care' of you.

eqrgrzsupr
I am sixteen going on seventeen
Innocent as a Joe,

Seniors I meet may tell me I'm sweet
And I must believe, I know.
Tlough I'm sixteen going on seventeen,
Hoping to save my pride,
I am aware my chances are bare,
Yet I know who's on my side.

Still unprepared I well might be
But I am backed by Sen ;
Timid and shy.
I do agree,
Now I'll be bold again.
Wardens' Council, robed in gowns'll
Willingly see me through.
Since you're seventeen going on eighteen
I'll beware of you.
