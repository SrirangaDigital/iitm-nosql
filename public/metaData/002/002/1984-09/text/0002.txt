CAMPASTIMES

September 1984 -

Vat-23, NO- 2
While admiring the stately galleon that
adorns the cover, you would have noticed
the singular absence of oars of any description.
There's a reason for this. It's

It is time to continue your education

In response
to the competition advertised in our
first issue, from the 250(‘ students
plus the staff, we have received 3 whole

One last thing.
Instead of drawing
aside an editor and telling him that
