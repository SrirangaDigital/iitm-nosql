Many 'thinkers'

in the past have commented on it.
Articles have appeared in
Campastimes, Focus and other
cesspools of our thoughts.
So lets

not talk about that, but of what
happens when THE CAMPUS IS A PLACE
OF PUBLIC RESORT!

I believe that this is the key

frequently lamented upon in these
pages.
A striking example is the
ready solution to the Mardi Gras
problem - it simply won't be
necessary anymore.
