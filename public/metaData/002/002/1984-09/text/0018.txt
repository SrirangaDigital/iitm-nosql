Gini learns that XXX

and Co have nothing to do with

He ought to
go to official YYY!
He is beginning to get the hang of things by
now.

hostel must nevertheless pay a
variety of specified hostel dues.
Gini's case seems to be quite the
reverse and he wonders whether
regular

students

and

research

students fall into different categories.
He is but a fresh graduate,
and his opting for a research
career reflects a mild temperament
and certain introvert characteristics.
A glance at his wrist informs him
that it will soon be 9.00 a.m. when
the adblock is expected to start
its day's work.
After extracting
his certificates etc. from his
trunk he confidently leaves his
belongings

and

trudges

off,

hoping

to finish off quickly with the
'formalities'.
The relevant floor
of

the

adblock,

Well, not absolutely, for

this

one

gentleman,

who explains that everybody is
'busy with the convocation' and
therefore it was quite impossible
for any admissions to be effected
that day.
Gini is advised to come
the next day and also cautioned
about the possibility of it being
a holiday, as the convocation is
traditionally followed by a day off.
He fishes out his admission offer
and carefully verifies all details
about date, time, month, and year.
No, he hasn't made any mistake at
all.
The kindly gentleman observes
his perplexed expression and after
some queries expresses the opinion
that hostel accommodation could be
arranged

even before

formal

admission.
Well, there's nothing to gain by
inhabiting the adhlock any longer
and our chum pushes off in search
of XXX.
When he finally locates
the office its worthy incumbent is

But here weAare at official YYY's
office.

It

happens

to

be

the

right

place for dealing with matters of
hostel accommodation.
Gini is
promptly asked

to

explain

how he

can expect to get a hostel room
when he is not yet a student of
the institute.
He ought to get
admission first!
Our friend has
no reply which can beat that sort
of logic.
This time he learns
that only the official YYY himself
(who is not the:e, naturally) could
possibly take a decision in such a
situation - 'I :m only a clerk,
saar, I must fol-‘w the rules'.
Furthermore, Gini is chided for
seeking accommodation so late.
The session has started over two
weeks ago and the hostels are full
by now.
His next move is obviously
to enquire about where and when he
can locate the illustrious YYY.
But the telephone interrupts the
proceedings.
Meanwhile other new
hopefuls like Gini also arriv: on
the scene.
With sudden inexplicable
authority the clerk distributes
some printed slips with appropriate
notings.
Gini makes out that he
is now authorised to part with
Rs.500 by way of hostel deposit,
and it is to be paid at the adblock.
He realizes he will be in deep
trouble if he is expected to fork
out a similar sum 'to the hostel
direct' as indizated in his admission
offer.
