A few minutes before the sun wrinkles

its nose and rises over yonder Oxidation
Pond, as the early worm toodles about
keeping one eye peeled for hopeful
early birds, a burly figure advances
menacingly down one of the sleeping
wings of Narmada in the grey gloom.

There is menace in his every step.

For
five unf agging years thus has
Breeze kept his end of the malaria
eradication programme up and rumour
