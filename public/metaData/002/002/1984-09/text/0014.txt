comprehending you.

I've always

admired you for your immense
mental capacity.
I've seen you
sad and gloomy.
But, I've never
seen you confused.
The clarity
of your thought has always fascinated me.
You were restless when
you couldn't give suitable outlet
to\the creative energy surging
within you.

CAHPﬁSTIHES

I wrote

that story.
The scientist there
doesn't stand for a particular
individual.
He represents the
present institution of science

which aims at controlling nature
and humanbeings through the
knowledge of their working rather
than unravelling the mysteries of
nature.
I didn't show you the
story before publication because
I thought it would be a pleasant
surprise for you.
From my friends'
opinion of the story, I expected it
to be discussed even in scientific
circles.
May be your colleagues
made fun of you.
(Actually you
must be happy about that.
That
only shows how powerful a storyteller your beloved wife is.)

You
Are you still angry With me?
don't believe what I say.
Perhaps,
you think, this is yet another
story and that I've already Sent a
copy of this for publication.
Please come.
I miss you so much.
Are you wondering as to how we'll
start talking again?
We'll go
about it in the usual way.
You'll
sit at your desk pretending to
solve equations.
I'll sit at mine
pretending to write stories.
