-5J:lOW I SURVIVED

(An entry in the diary of Time)

I've seen the dawn of ~reation
live watched the birth of man
I am the 4th dimension
I am •••• TIME.

I saw you walk on four leas,
Then watched you stand on two,
As you swept your way to supremacy
How I admired you •••
••• For here was a creative species
Who could my powers preen
You can imagine my apprehension
When you wrote of a Time Machine •
••• Came along a man called Einstein
Who talked of the Relativity Law
Now I was getting worried
My power beginning to thaw,
Just as my apprehension
Began to rise and swell
You discovered the A-Bomb
And rang your own death knell •••
The people asked for PEACE
But the message wasn't clear,
Gorbachev and Reagan were deaf
So they heard NUCLEAR.
Came the weapons stockpile
And away went my fear
I knew I had won this battle
For the 21st Century was here.
Then one day some old loony
I won't mention his name
Put his hand on the button
And that was the end of the game.
There was a big explosion
And you were blown away
To disappear forever
While I remained to stay.
