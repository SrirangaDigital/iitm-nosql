I years (July '86 - June '90) - This sem. sees
computing and Thermody. moving into the A-slot.
Pisku and Resnick & Halliday remain in their old
slots. But Shames moves into ascendancy by
entering the D-slot. When combined with

toughness. But NCC/NSO moving into the Sunday
slot shows that a very hect1c and ti~ing period
You will not have much time for friends and relatives

Important nos:- 10,30,10,50.
Important dates:- Quiz, mid sem & End sem dates.
Prominent colour:- One colour dominates your mood-Blue.
II years (July '85 - June '89) - In this sem.
Physics, maths(Core) and Chemistry move out of
your slots and this shows signs of a good time
ahead. The possibility of cool electives enhances
the above viewpoint.
But Elec. Sciences II

as easy as you thought he was, while the two
~ranch courses leave most students in the lurch.
Of course, the muggoes
manage to find themselves a perch.
Important nos.:- 10,30,10,50 (Marks you can't get in ESII).
Important dates: Registration date for next sem.
