A FAREWELL NOTE
""

The occasion -

Po

SeShu,

PhoDo

213 Tapti.

That was so far, is so near:
Written it is, we are to part

Reconciliation doth seem impossible.
To live,

for me,

is not to leave you;

To live, you are to leave me.
How subtle it is all -

I bid thee farewell, dear.
Morrow comes
Sun dawns on the world, not unto me dear
The shrubs, our companions,

The trees that saw us when we knew no time
Standing under them,
The paths we tread together,
Ask me in one voice 'Where's he?‘

Where am I to fetch you,
The lamp of my life,
Without you, void is my life.
Yet -

To live,

for me,

is not to leave you

To live, you are to leave me.
How subtle it is all I bid thee farewell, dear.

§§§
Most people would succeed in small things,
if they were not troubled with great ambitions.
