-+But the world did have one weapon against him - he needed food
and gasoline for his craft. This became his undoing. Food and gas were
not sold to him any more. He became slowly desperate and hungry. The
breaking point came when he began to chew his buttons. He got into his
craft and decided to search for food and gas in the past. His many trips
had, however, made him an all-time fiend.
However hard he tried, he could get no fuel any where. His
hunger forced him to one decision. He would make a trip to a time when
there was no human. He travelled back 300 million years. Getting out
of his craft, he noticed that even his fuel stocks run out. Looking
around, Dr. Gasser noticed one thing - there was nothing which looked
edible.

So there he was, empty fuel can in his hand and nothing in his
stomach, while dinosaurs watched and pterodactyls flew.

A FAREWELL NOTE
- P. Seshu, Ph.D.
The occasion 213 Tapti.
That was so far, is so near:
Written it is, we are to part
Reconciliation doth seem impossible.
To live, for me, is not to leave you;
To live, you are to leave me.
How subtle it is all I bid thee farewell, dear.
Morrow comes
Sun dawns on the world, not unto me dear
The shrubs, our companions,
The trees that saw us when we knew no time
Standing under them,
The paths we tread together,
Ask me in one voice 'Where's he?'
Where am I to fetch you,
The lamp of my life,
Without you, void is my life.
Yet To live, for me, is not to leave you
To live, you are to leave me.
How subtle it is all I bid thee farewell, dear.

§§§
Most people would succeed in small things,
if they were not troubled with great ambitions.
