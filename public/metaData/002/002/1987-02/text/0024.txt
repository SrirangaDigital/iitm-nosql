RE-QUEST

- R. Balaji,

Sitting in class one day I thought,
It was high time I found the girl I sought,
Thus began the everlasting search
Which I have carried out without a lurch.
And find her I did, one day Going with her boyfriend for a sundae.
Disappointed I turned back to the multitudes on Earth,

Amongst whom, I must say, there was no dearth
Of beautiful, nubile girls to suit my taste,
From whom I was afraid to choose in haste
One, who would sit and be my friendTill my very end.
Nubile girls are not hard to find,

Even if the one who searched for them was blind,
They are, everwhere, floating around
As headswill on a merry go round.
But the most difficult task I found
was to accost them, when they are around,
For if they don't like your sound,
Their slippers would make you bound.
The fear of a slap on my face
has considerably slackened my pace,
And so I stand today
Without a girl to keep me gay.
I'm sure that there is amongst you now,
Someone who would like to be my lady love,
I would like you to write and say Whether you would like to make my day.

251 Jamuna.-
