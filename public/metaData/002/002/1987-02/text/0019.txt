out. And now the power-cut! Luckily, he had remembered to switch off
the pump.

thought Arjuna. Today's mail contained an information sheet on certain
experimental set-up from the manufacturers - versatile, microprocessorbased and all that. All these years he had been trying to make a
similar set-up in the lab.
If only I were having this to work with"
Suddenly, the door opened and his guide, Dr. Krishna entered the
lab. The characteristic smile vanished from the guide's face as he saw
the expression on the face of his student, Arjuna.
"What happened, my
dear young man?" he asked.
"Sir, I want to quit." said Arjuna, "no equipment, no facility,

What about the research

"I am coming to that." Sipping his tea, Dr. Krishna continued,

something less ambitious.
But then, the experience gained through the
hard work and the training will surely prove to be of great use to you
in future.
You know about many of our previous students who have made
bright careers, both in India and abroad, based on the experience gained
