TV - THE IDIOT 3033
They sit like ruminating cattle
Chewing their daily cud:
Of inept actors and newscasters.
Jarring jingles — ad mantras
Tired dramatics - strained cliches
Token murder,
Prodigal son,

desperate crime
pregnant daughter.

And they see him smile:
Reassuring lullaby of rhetoric 'Education Policy','New Attidues',
'21st Century' - all platitudes.
Avoid the gawkers on the streets
Craning by the TV stores, peering

Masala magic, inspired bore:
Cricketers run casually on the pitch
Politicians promise dreams without a hitch
Detectives chase women and crack lousy jokes.
Children starve, cooked food burns on stoves
People die of emptiness, every where
How much food has the flickering box bestowed?

Just tired truths, clumsy lies,
The fatal fascination of fairy tales.
Some starve and die
Some thieve or murder
Most find bosses to kill them
Others embrace the troubled streets
Find their gin and cause.

Above them all reigns the New Pied Piper
Piping his prescribed tune for the masses

As they creep slowly, surely, towards the lake.
