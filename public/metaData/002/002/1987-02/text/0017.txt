A.N.H~.

•••• no time for sleep. This year's stock of fresh air supply
reservation is gone. I may be fined for breathing extra air soon.
Ed~-Apparently air was not free - supplied only against fresh-air
coupons. Each coupon had to be obtained by filling in one form. As
people consumed more air while filling in the forms, they were continually
filling up these forms.
At this point the narrative ends. PC/XT turned into a bat and was
recovered buried under a file of forms by a routine patrol party. We
have not been able to communicate with him so far. We haven't found his
body, so he is leqally missing.

21st

century
- Sriranjan Chaudhuri.
st. Joseph's, Bangalore.

When mango trees
grow shorter than man
And when buildings shoot up
without man
When children grow up
Unlike man
And when life is lived
Like half a man
It must be the 21'st Century.
When books are written
Not by man
And food is eaten
With the help of man
When rainfall comes
With a wish from man
And when man is treated
Like half a man
It must be the 21st Century.
When I don't understand it
And I ask why
It must be the 21st century.
