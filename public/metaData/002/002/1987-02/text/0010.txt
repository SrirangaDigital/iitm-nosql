ONE AND THE OTHER

- P.

Ganesh.

The train moves slowly now

It's nearing its destination
A journey, unforgettable,
Yet not remembered now,

as the end nears.

The luggage is packed

And the bags ready.
The burden is heavy to carry
And the train is old.
Real old.
Uncertainty in the new Lands,
Insecure, Nervous.

Who will carry my burdens, the results of my desire,
Accumulated during my journey?
"You‘ll have to carry them yourself
My son," says our Father in Heaven.
"I'll carry them for your, Sir" I turn around and look to find
An old man, his back bent by age and load,
His eyes pleasing and pleading.
His stomach, empty.
The train whistle was shrill
It cut into his hazv thoughts.
And shocked him into reality,
He, of his dreams, of his youth,

faded away.

He, who lifts the burden of others,
Albeit for a paltry sum,
He, who was the shell of the egg
The ubiquitous but still the mysterious,
Useful and useless.

Man carries another's burdens,
He is called a Martyr.

Give your sins unto me
Give your luggage unto me.
Both demand a price,
One subtle, another gross.

One threatens you with hell
Another knows your luggage.
Both save you trouble.
