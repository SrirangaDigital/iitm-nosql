wants to shave every other day, eh?)

WHICH PATH DID I TAKE
(A poem written bv a young poet of fourteen years, M. Suresh
Majella, IX B, K.V.I.I.T)
Why did you search for me,
Beloved Lord,
When I, devoutly knelt,
Before your shrine,
Praying for your blessings •••
The path I pursued,
Though the one
You yourself gave us,
Was so unfortunate
That it did not touch
The fringes of yours •••
If only did I know
That you to my humble abode
Would arrive,
I would have eagerly
Prepared my heart •••
Now, so abruptly
You are
Before me.
Lord
I offer you
My gratitude
For that is all I

haVe with me.
