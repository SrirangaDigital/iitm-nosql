and often expounded his views on various topics in the inside pages.

His

first trip through time was scheduled to start on the first day of the

summer vacation.
Where was he going to go? His first trip would be a
short one into the future, to see how long the world would last before it
was blown up.
The appointed day came.
The time-craft was loaded with food
supplies and of course, gasoline.
Thousands of flashlights popped as

Dr. Gasser's bulk ascended the steps to the top of the craft.

Opening a

latch, Dr. Gasser began to descend into his machine.
The gathered crowd
cheered as he waved and shut the door.
The crowd became silent.
History

was being made before their eyes.

As they watched, the craft became

brighter and brighter, ultimately so bright that they had to shield their
eyes.
The light's intensity then decreased.
The craft was disappearing.

Finally there was a man in time-travel.

The crowd gasped at the empty

area where the craft had been.
And then - what was happening?
The craft
was coming back into view.
There was no doubt, the same machine was back.
What had happened was quite simple.
Dr. Gasser had merely come
back to the same day and the same time as he had left.
The crowd refused

to believe this fact then, no one believes an honest man.

Dr. Gasser

told them what he had seen.
A major disaster in twenty years time would
completely destroy civilization.

This made him a media celebrity once again.
Headlines across
the globe praised Dr. Gasser.
"Time traveller predicts end of the world",
was one.
Another was "Traveller in time becomes prophet of doom."
Dr. Gasser was endlessly interviewed and became a TV star of sorts.
All the glamour went to Dr. Gasser's head.
He began to wonder
what would happen if he changed the course of history.
His second trip
came soon after this idea.
He went back to 1964 and averted Kennedy's

death.
Then he was back in 1986 to see what had happened.
What he found
was - nothing!
An unknown man had saved Kennedy's life.
That was all.
