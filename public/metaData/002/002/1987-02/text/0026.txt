THE MOOD

(TARAMS POLAMAA?)

- FLASK, 127 Narmada.

One could feel it. Almost touch it. Think it? definitely. It
was in the air that night, then. The mood. The mood for a break. To
break away from whatever was on hand. Mugging? Maybe. But one thing
was sure. It was there. Came a call - Shattering, piercing - rending
the silence of the night like a hot knife would butter.
'Tharams
Polamaa'? 'Hang on I'm coming'.
It had begun. The exodus. To the Mecca of the midnights. That
revered place. Oh! for a cup of single SP chai garam garam! The stones,
the dogs, the buffaloes. But then the pigs, the shit and damn- the
mosquitoes.
At 10.00 p.m. began the vigil. Two dhothi clad figures walked
out of the darkness into the light. -2 SP coffees, one less sugar.Simple, short, but effective. The chaiwalla got to work. Two glasses
emerged to do duty. Chop! chop! Two spoons of coffee. Chop! chop! two
spoons of sugar. Whirr! A stream of milk poured in. As he 'stretched'
the milk, now one with the coffee they wondered. -Why tharams, why now?"
But 'they couldn't answer. The vigil was on.
Retired on stones, discharged by that behemoth: The structures
lab under trees of tranquility they continued the watch. Sipping coffee no not iust that, but Tharams SP coffee; they waited.
The smaller of the two sensed it. First it was on them. The
mood! A tingling! Up his spines! It was coming nearer. Wait, he could
hear it.
'whir! Whir!' As spokes went up, then down like a wheel of
fortune. Voices! Two! one high, one low, one loud, one muted. Was
it them?
They consulted in hushed tones.
'Is it them?'
'Yes?'
'Sure?'
"Never more than now!"
He was right. He could see them now as they came in coasting, braking,
hopping off - grins on faces. Yes it was them. The mood was in the air.
'Two SP teas, two bun omelettes'.
Simple, short but effective. The couple retired to blocks near
the path.

The vigilantes hid. Their time wasn't yet come.
for the mood was on them.

They had to

The omelettes and SP's came. The couple munched hungrily unaware
of human presence. Lost in thoughts of spokes whirring up, then down, up
then down. Behind them foot steps. Short, swift, muffled whispers,
raised hands 'glinting' in the moonlight. It was on.
Heads turned
Mouths opened. Silent screams as hands 'thrust
violently. As he thrust the smaller one the vigilante gasped. For he
had seen it - his face masked with death. He screamed ••••
"Tarams Polamaa .•• Hey! Gopsi are you sleeping? Wake up".
He arose. What? He had crashed? Then he saw his hands. They were
red. In the corner lay a shattered mirror. Victim of the Mood Tarams Polamaa.
