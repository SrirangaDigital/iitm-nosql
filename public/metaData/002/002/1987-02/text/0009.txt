The further prognostications based on the Diogenes Law are
slightlv less reliable, but we present them all the same. By the turn
of the century the lIT will only conduct entrance exams for which a
ranking certificate will be given. Anyway everyone would have realised
that the only worthwhile instruction in this country is provided by the
likes of Agrawal and Brilliant Tutorials.

§§§

DISTANT STRAINS
As she stood, stilled by chill
The distant mullahs called to Allah
The strains straining to reach her
The wind blowing right across her.
In sti~lness we see things clearly.
Turbid,waters become pure mountain streams
And muddled minds become cleared up.
She saw the primitive, undiluted animal 1n man.
Did
Did
Her
Her

she pray to the Gods for help?
she think of her husband and children?
body was rigid, eyes dilated,
sari crumpled under her fingers.

Nothing moved in that
A sudden wind brought
Loud and clear to her
And took away with it

§§§

one moment
the prayers
ears
her fears.
- P. Ganesh.
