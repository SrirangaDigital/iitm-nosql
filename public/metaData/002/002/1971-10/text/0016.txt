CAMPASTIMES
never heard of the slam-force by blddmg
opponent's SUit? Philosophy man! ! You
must have a certain amount of philosophic
resignation ID fd(.tng all SituatIOns In lIfe;
esp\-clally the moron opposite the bridge table.
With a poor partner, you HAVE been preempted Well Just bid the game that's
cel tam
4H or SD-preferably the heart
with l\1m for a partner and write m your own
httle red dIary before gOing to bed that you
ml%ed a cold slam. Its so much better than
gotng 6 down on the wrong contract.
There IS no use In shouting at your partner
or explammg to him patiently at the end of
the game that your bId meant an Impregnable
game 111 anyone of the two non-bid SlUts;
and that With Just three cards or a doubleton
honour ID one of the red ~UltS he could go
upto slam, and that the only difference
between your blddlOg It and hiS would have
been that he would have played It IDstead of
you, and that m most mstances of thiS sort,
It would be better to have the lead from East;
and that ....
He WII! hsten mcely or SUlkily and on the
next hand you overcall 2 clubs over I club
holdmg AK xxxx and 14 pomts, he Will Ignore
the level of the blddtng and the fact that a
second SUit has also not been bid by him or
by the opponents He wdl go on to game ID
one of hiS two red SUits 4H With Q, x, X ID
which you hold Jx. The great secret of
rubber bridge IS to play your pdrtner as well
as your {)pponents, and never exhibit knowledge which partner cannot comprehend. Its
much better to make the best of eXisting
conditions than strive for the best, assummg
absolute conditions.
P. N. VIJAY.

THE FOLLY OF BEING WISE
Yes I know you. You are the guy who
knows' the system you play pretty well. Sull
you get • that nut' for jour partner and
Invanably land up In the wrong contract on
strong hands The result, If you are crazy
about the game like me. lo,mg your temper
and USIDg words that would make you blush
If you heard them from someone else; If that
Ignoramus tnes to Justify hlTn~e1f, such fury
as to give vou an mdlgeslion, and pOSSibly an
F In the next penodlcal. Unless you are
already B C.G.-PosltlVe (BTIdge-ContractGUiles), let me try to moculate you agaInst
that paraslte-I mean the moron ill front of
you at the table.
Where Ignorance IS bhss Its folly to be
Wise thiS mundane, over-worked and almost
meamngless old saw acquires new life and
prevails With double sway-yes, preventmg
doubles aga1Dst you-when It comes to the
bridge-table Take thiS Instance: You are
south and Moron IS your p~rtner. Pitiless,

kinds of pressures that our young people live
under begmnmg as early as age three or four.
Our young people spend a very large part of
their time, even before they go on to college,
domg what the schools thrnk the untverSlties
want; they go on domg what they want whde
they're at the umversltles, which may be anythmg from four to heaven-knows-how-many
years; and, as I said before, they carry 011
them for the rest of their lives whatever sort
of brand the ulllverslty has chosen to put on
them. Their demand-that SlOce Umversltles
exercI~e thiS enormous control over the lives
of theIr students, students should have somethmg to say about them and the way they are
run-seems to me to be altogether right and
Just. If umversltles want to say to our young
people m effect, 'We are Just a gathenng of
scholars domg our thmg, please stop bothermg us and mterfermg With us, and let us do
our own thmg the way we want', then they
have got to get theIr feet off the collective
necks of the young and give up the extraordmary and unjustIfiable power that they
have acqUired over their hve~.

PitIless deals and pre-empts wIth 3C. Your
partner, unusually for him, makes the correct
bid of over-calling 3S and Wise Guy doubles
hopefully and qUite wrongly. You know that
your hand IS worth a slam In one of the two
red SUItS. And so you make the unassailable
master-bid of 4C The poor moron, not
understandmg what IS gomg on, and m all
good mtenhons very happy to have you, the
better player playmg the hand, passes with
hiS A xX}.. • Support'. And true to hiS name,
Wise-Guy does not take you out with a double
and you merely lose them III IOO'S
On second thought, IS It not all your fault ?
PlaYing against a good player, your bid would
ha"e been more than bnlltant. Because, m
addmon to showmg sky-high red SUits It
would also have been a good cue-bid telImg
him the club \old you hold. But walt ..... ' '
