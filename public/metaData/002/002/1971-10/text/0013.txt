CAMPAstIMES

Fall 1971]

The Russians ~e coming
Many people do not seem to like the comIng of the RUSSians, with theIr movIes to the
OAT Worse IS the case WIth the shorts, that
come along wlth. Few are llltere,ted III knowIng that the SavItt workers work III theu
vacatlOn~ also, on theIr own accord, Without
allY incentives whatsoever. FantaSIes such as
t1us. "hen there I~ the lure of the sun and the
strand nearby arc for nIce old malds only.

Choose a nice I.ttle Ume IJke the Summer
Yacatton. take a good clean road, raIse a few
hIdeous bumps, here and there, everywhere.
Pamt them black, pamt them "hlte (m alternate strokes) and you h3\ e effectIvely
made yourself object of fooltshness and nasty
cntlClsm We do not blame the authOritIes
What they dId was Just to choose a mce
htde tIme hke . . . ~
'When people can r31se a hue and cry,
and sometimes even a small fund In aId of
refugees f~om East Bengal \\ ho are the
majorIty people m that regIOn, It IS surpnsmg, that the student population, whIch IS
undoubtedly the majority lnslde of the
campus, "as not even consulted on the advisablhty of puttmg up those ugly breakers
o\er much trafficked macadams. The ImmensIty of such wasteful spendmg IS particularly jarnng when we have to make
do "ahout a proper cycle stand In anv of
the hostels. An abysmal lack of a sense of
priorIties IS eVident.
When Summer brings its gJoty
In came the seven httle bIrds In the beglunmg of the year and the year began
Last reports mdlcate they have been flying
hIgh and flymg low, sometimes rolImg on skates,
sometimes fillmg up deflated cycle tubes. It
IS hoped that they would take a general Jrtterest In the actiVIties around and not find
themselves 10 the second posman, as 1S the
habIt WIth German regular verbs, as also wlth
prefixes of the seperable German verbs,
",lule not many of us know of the awnflary
verbs v.luch have a simIlar taste
A Case for more Semesters of German
Three seme5ters of German are bemg taught
at the U G. le\el One should at least be
gIVen a chance to explOlt thiS begmmng more
frUitfully. A few mOre semesters of German
wouJd do no one no harm, much more expertise could be obtamed III puttmg the
German regular verbs etc. m the second
posItion In the sentence, where they naturally
belong
N.C.C.
And when the cadets came marching In, It
was a pItIful Sight Not many In the N C C.
or out of It, are 10 love WIth thiS organtsatlOn
More plea~ant prospects lIke IdZY evenings at
home (lIke for those In the N.S 0.) to name
one, are dented the unfortunate lot who are
rash enough to sIgn along the dotted lme of
the forms dlstnbuted at the begmnmg of the
year by the N C C authOrtties. It would be
oilly falf that the N.S O. guys be gIVen a
chance to put up their sales talk at the same
time, unless of Course the academIC sectLOn \S
prejudiced III favour of the N C.C

Hearsay
It IS u<ual practice for PTls or some
such authontles to be present, representmg
theIr Institute at the draw for fixtures of
any tournament It I~ a pity that due to
some oversIght and hence non·repre~entatlon
at the draw, last year's Jomt Tenllls Champs
In the Inter-collegiate tournament have had
to fight It out fIght In the begInmng of thIS
year A recent tennis encounter led us to
much embarrassment when La) ola beat llT
by two matches to one. It IS hoped that
the PTIs take more Interest III sports
actIvitIes m and around the campus, and give
our lads a fightmg chance.
Passions
It IS frustratmg to know that access to a
certam hostel IS to be gamed only after
filhng up some Irrelevant details in a tattered
old regl~tef-book, even about two months
after commencement of the semester There
could be only one plaUSIble explanattoneJther the warden or the watchman or both
of them are excessively found of collectmg
signatures.
Farewell or an Obituary
The gas-column, a sort of semi-personal
collectIOn of anecdotes, by AaJoo Will be
seen In the columns of Campastzmes no
more. AaJoo has passed out. ThIS column
had never faded to mterest, With Its usual
sort of caustIc humoul:. We shall miss
It.
