Authonty which IS supposed to repre~ent the
that he IS supposed to fight.
Yes, the chOice IS not ca"y but nevertheless
crUCial Any authOrity that IS entrenched and
wIelds power because It I" entrenchcd and
estabh.hed IS the Establishment.
The radlcahsm that eXists In our country
to-day IS totally different from that eXlstlflg In
the We~t. Most of It has been the use of
revolutIOnary methods to achIeve tnvlal ends.
Changtng SIgnboards, re-routtng buses, may
seem glOriOUS for the passing hour but are
about as permanent as the dancmg wasp on
the foammg crest. LIfe, most of our leaders
don't seem to understand IS not one long
Journey of cheap thrills. Milhons of our
generation In Amenca thronged Montgomery
to protect agatnst segregation. How many of
us have bothered to raise our vOice agatnst the
way students are admItted to Umversltles?
But when
, Not my problem' you may say
He gets the pull that pushes Him before you,
than the whole thmg might seem shghtly less
academlc. Lethargy among the maJonty and
confUSIOn among the tntelhgent have led to
the absolute bankruptcy of progressIve thm·
kIng In Our campuses to-day. No doubt,
there have been excepttons, Mr Keatmg spent
an 'awful wonderful' day at Kanpur trymg to
explain away to mtelhgent and mdlgnant
students the tndlfterence of hiS bosses up
there. ConfUSIOn among liS can only help
the con men around us
ThIS life IS yours
and If VOll are not sure with all your sCientIfic
outlook what IS gomg to happen to It-not
In termS of Jobs and helluva time yar,,' but m
terms of happiness-you may be sure that
In the words of an Amencan girl
nobody IS
tn a state college .-' I leal nt more about the
workmg of our Umverslty ill a week of the
Slt-tn than tn 4 years of study'. ThiS IS not
a call for you to go and SIt on some costly
eqUipment and promptly break It. It Simply
goes to show that unless you are prepared to
look around and questIOn every God-forsaken
half-truth commg out of pIOUS !Ips, you are
gomg to end up as a log of wood. In the
words of Abraham Lincoln ThiS country
belongs to the people. 'The laws ot thIS
country are theirs, they have the constttutlOnal
right to amend It or the revolutIOnary TIght to
overthrow It' and Lmcoln, my dear Joe, was
no Naxahte Take the UmverSltles. From

CONFUSION IN THE CAMPUS
Berkeley-Chldambaram-Cohen BendltDr. Kalalgnar - Estabhshment - ,'Vomen's
LiberatIOn - Rosa Luxembourg - amIdst a
maze of such seemmgly IrreconcIlable
IdeologIes, the student feels hIs way about hke
Mankad at a late outswmger from Sno", . HIS
problems and hIS declslon~ are the poltcles of
the future for he belongs to the generatton

agamst this IS the lad lost Ifl mundane tTlvlahty,
adding a touch of pearl grey to hIS Ivory
tower We babble on hopmg that the latter
IS In a bltssful mmonty.
Much of the confusIOn that eXIsts In student
campuses to-day would be cleared If people
knew what they meant when they s:ud '\ hat
they thought. Words have begun to dance
round hke the dance of St Vltus thatthey have
as httle meanmg as NIJahngappa's soclahsm or
IndIra Gandln's conscIence. Take the much
maltgned \\ord, Establtshment, as a case m
pomt. It ha< been beaten around so much
that one would find It tough gomg to make a
chap understand that It dId not mean Just
that tutor who gave him a B Just because he
expressed the work done In calone. The
great hberator thrOWing hIS hordes to help
doddermg army generals plunder mnocent
freedom fighters IS as much a part of the
Estabhshment as the ChampIOn of Democracy
who thinks that a pmg-pong table IS a good
~nough substitute for the
UNO
The
trade umon leader who basks m the sunshme
that a well· engineered birthday celebratIon
affords IS as much a part of the Establishment
as the Cap tam of Industry who becomes the
VIce-PresIdent of the SPCA by selhng mmk
coats; and the student leader who thmks of hIS
post as a prelude to a place m high socIety IS

Illustrate grievous mlsl.lbhng of an Ideology of
competItIve aggrandIzement
As might be
expected therefore, academIC hlflng exhIbits all
the ethIcal deJtcacy of real estate brokerage.
SycophantIC salesmanshIp controls the acqUIrIng of prestIgIous Jobs, awards and pUblicatIons In the current expansIon of hIgher
education the tradlltonal ehtlst and paternal
master-protege placement system becomes a
mampulatlon of connections and Images The
appropnate morals and manners for all thIS
racketeenng help determine what happens
dally tn the class-rooms.
Students In our country have Isolated
themselves from the maInstream of the nat'on's
life by confUSing themselves WIth platitudes.
We as a commumty are ready to Judge harshly
and must be prepared to be Judged as harshly.
If you are gOing to wm an electIOn by plaYing
up Paul agamst Peter, then you have no
earthly rIght to fight the Harry whom Henry
pushes m front of you We are a pnvlleged
class, no doubt
But the amount of coheSIOn
that eXists m our outlook makes that pTlvllege
more of a mockery than an asset.
Where are we gOing to get mvolved I Are
we gOing to become Don QUlxotes for a
change, for that gentleman m spIte of his
rather eccentnc habIts had a remarkably clear
mmd , he was sure he was gomg to fight the
wmdmlll, can It be saId of you ~ That the
wmdmlll was not a demon, he dId not reahse
But your knowledge of the quantum mechamcs
of the ngld rotator could thmk up hundred
way" of blowmg the thing to smIthereens. If
only you were clear enough at least that It
needed to be blown up to smIthereens
There IS so much of filth around us; It
doesn't need an Edltonal of the Campasilmes
to say that.
But It does need some such
thmg to say that the filth can be somewhere
else
But If you and I are not deCIded
on puttmg the filth where It belonged,
well, If you and I are not even sure
that the filth should be cleared, If you and I
don't seem to agree on the nature ot the filth
Itself, If you and I hear day m and day out
that what you and I thtnk 15 good IS really
filth and what we had long ago deCided was
filth IS good, If you and I can't walk ten paces
Without pulhng In opposite directions then you
and I need not belong to the same generatIon
at all. But If you and I really started smelhng
around, It IS qUite pOSSIble that we mIght
agree on some mutually abhorrent filth and
then, well, Bamm goes the bnck wall and
down comes the house of cards. It IS as
simple as that.
