CAMPASTIMES
PNV What do you feel about the rules that
our hostels have?
VB : I tlunk "e arc old enough to realIse
our responsibilitIes Whenever rules
are made, It IS n\ore temptmg to
bre<1k them; these rules have no
meaning. In the average IITlan'<;
life the most cherl~hed part IS the
hos'tel life Even that shouldn't be
made miserable
PNV: Do you think the Gymkhana should
move closer to outside student
bodies?
VB
Yes ThiS has been neglected very
much. As far as student lIfe goes,
we are ~egregated and thiS IS very
undesl{able ThiS can be done III
many \\ays:
AssoCHltlonS, Conferences etc. We can't cut ourselves off from our own generation. You see, the lIT student IS
rather cut off because of the locatIOn
of the campus Itself which does not
gIVe you much chance to move
about. Also the academic calendar
IS so tight that we have no tune
to catch up. Because of a periodical, we practically lose 2 days We
must change thiS. Then, holV and
why of thiS should be worked out.
PNV: What do you thmk of staff-student
relatIonships In the lIT ~
VB . I thmk they are on a parallel path.
They are close but there IS no mmgImg. No student knows an) thmg
about the staff club except for
selhng some tickets fQr OAT movies
You see there IS a lot of lazmess;
too much of marks, grades and
hence grumblmg The root IS the
educatIOnal pattern. If there IS any
close relation, then Immediately sus~
plclOn spnngs up from both Sides,
Everythmg seems to be weighed
m terms of'S' average.
PNV: Will the Gymkhana tnVlte polttlClanS
to come and talk to the students?
VB . No. I don't thmk that students should
lIlvolve themselves m POlttICS. We
have too many problems ourselves.
PNV: There are a lot of slums around our
campus. Wtil the Gymkhana take
any mterest In their welfare?
VB
There are orgamsatlOns hke the Leo
Club for all thiS. We have to solve
our problems first

PNV: What do you thmk of drugs. dnnk,
etc., among the students?
VB : No comments please.
PNV Do you feel more girls ought to be
admitted Into the lIT ~
VB
From a socml pomt of viewÂ» yes, yes.
We could have aUG. course 10
Humanities, top technological mstltuttons m U S. have It.
PNV Gne the order of pnonty 10 which you
hope to ta\.kle your problems.
VB
The first and forLmost IS that the
Gymkhana must be made powerful
It has no teeth, to bite. If I made
the Establishment aware of the
eXistence of students, I would have
done a good Job.
I thmk the
amount of "ark I do hllrdly matters
MAKE THE GYMKHANA A
TRUE STUDENT BODY: OR
ELSE SCRAP IT.
PNV Your message to Campastmles ~
VB
There IS a lack of commumcatton on a
mass-baSIS between staff and stu~
dents Your maga7lne can act as
a bndge. You can lessen stram and
Increase understanding

What do you conSider as the secret
of your success?
Hard work, ablhty to convmcc my
colleagues m the Gymkhana, the
popularity I gamed by last year's
success as sports secretary of Ganga
and probably the good Impre~slon I
cleated among the freshers, the postgraduate,\ and the girls
What do you think of the present
system of electIOn ~ Do you thmk
the fine arts, SOCial and hterary
secrctancs and the editor ot CampastImes bhould be given chance to
vote? What do you thInk of the
'one man-one vote' syqtem of
e1ectmg the General Secretary of the
Gymkhana~

Ans

: Frankly speakIng, I am not for thIS
system ot dectlon But there can
be no remedy The maIO defect
hes III the fact that a certam member
may not be fully aware of the candIdate's talent espeCially If he IS
from another" Illg 01 the Gymkhana
but he may sull be aware of hIS
qualities like hard "ark etc. Captams could be given a chance to vote
ThiS system IS a bit odd I am
not sure of support from all the
sports secretanes But one advantage of thiS system IS that a spltt IS
not obvIOUS and sports secretanes
may not be fully a\\ are of my posi~
tlOn as far as majority In the committee
goes.
'One man, One
vote' system wtlllead to the danger
of unhealthy pohucs creepmg I n more money WIll have to be spent.
For the other secretaries, It IS
definttely
not
adVisable
One
advantage of the present system
IS that we get to know more
people.

: I have heard of you as a great optimist and an ambitious man As an
optimist, where do you thmk IIT-M
Will stand at the end of thiS year?
What suggestions would you hke to
make so as to bnng m any sweepIng changes III the sports wmg of
the Gymkhana) As an ambltlOuS
man, what do you propose to do
durmg thiS year' Any mnovatlons?
Any promises?

Ans.

Many others call me a pesslmtstI actually had a pesslmlsttc vIew
before Ganga won tho Schroeter
last year and before I won thiS year.
On the whole, I feel the postgraduates are bound to do better
thiS year With new talents commg
ill on their Side
In the Intercollegiate level, we might Just be
able to mamtam last year's standard
But "e are sure to Will III
the commg Inter-I1T Meet at Bombay (first place, of course) ThIS
year, the elections were held pretty
late and so many thmgs have to be
done
As far as the appomtment of captams are concerned,
have
certam
fixed
we must
standards
SenlOtlty should stdl
continue to be a CrIterion Voting
for captamcy In teams Will not be
senSible ConSideration of ment
may help m games Itke Cricket,
where he has a greater part to play.
I feel the prevIous year's cap tams,
the sports secretaries and the Gymkhana preSident can together meet
and deCide about thiS. Here we
have a lot of prohlems, espeCially
m provldmg transport for the teams
It mvolves a lot of time and difficulty. I feel the Institute should
prOVide a bus every time so that a
cheenng squad can accompany the
team.
Another problem concerns
money for the kit-I was told there
IS gomg to be a drastiC cvt \fl thIS
year's budget. A few new additions
thiS year could bc a shuttle badmlD.
