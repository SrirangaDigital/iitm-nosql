CAMPASTIMES

Fall 1971]

In India's national game we are quite
candidly nowhcre ncar top standard. We have,
It IS true, some 1500d victOries but the way m
which we werc mauled by Chnsttan showed
that there ~s more to a team than Just d few
good players. Any way, under Raghavendra
Rao they are tramcd hard and we hope to
bnng better tIdmgs on the morrow.
Mention must be made of the enthUSiasm
ShO\\ll by the crowds that throng our playmg
fields to applaud and apprectate.
We hope to bnng more news 111 the ISSueS
to come. Perhaps It WIll be our pnvllege to
WrIte about fenCIng, blllldrds and women
skating champIOnshIps 1£ our secretanes know
what they art. talkmg about.

The battle of Waterloo It IS said was won
on the playmg fields of Eton. Well, we
wouldn't really commit ourselves to say that
Our contmgent to Bombay might as an a~lde
liberate BangIa Desh. But more people seem
to be spending more time chasmg balls and
thrusting themselves Into unenviable shapes
and so we are happy.
The object rie art of the newS from the
plaYIng fields IS of course K. Jayant When
they brought the good news Ghent to Alx It
IS said the land was saved.
When they
brought Jayant from Bangalore , all mental
calculations for the Wmter festival of strategem
and spoil went up by 10 pomts. Well, not
really because the Nationals at Hyderabad
clash ominously wIth the Meet and we can
only keep our fingers crossed as to whether
Jayant can make It or not.
As a formal announcement of his joining _
the fray, Jayant won the Bertram thIS year
though one was unpleasantly surprised to
seem hlffi droppIng games like Elna's H's.
He told me that he has not really got Into the
groove as yet. Anyway not mto that groove
which made Mlf Kaslm seem like a Dacshund
on a Saturday night at Parry's last year. He
hasn't obVIOusly as yet found a formula that
wtll make hlffi determtne the Planck's constant
till 4 IS pm. and take all the lads half-anhour later. The rest oLour T.T. players
are IIDprovmg day by day (like the Rexona
~lrl) trymg to fit mto the New SOCiety. Only
tlIne, Inter-Umverslty and Inter-lIT can tell.
'Something IS rotten m the State of Denmark' said Hamlet Well, somethmg IS wrong
With our Cricket. The absence of some playen;
cannot really be Cited as the cause smce by all
accounts the newer crop 1S qUlte capable.
VaradaraJan IS however qUite confident of
keepmg up the i!:ood work that we have always
done m Inter-UDlver~lty (thIS year It IS at
Madras), With a catchmg cradle to augment
the' s\!p-snapplng', we had better bowl cut
the opposltton qUicker or Campastrmes and Its
readers would like to know the reasons why.
Our performance m lettmg Law make 250 for
2 down was very dlsappomtmg though RamakrIShnan's batting (hIS century agaIl1~t lOB.
IS still v.hlspered with awe among the City
grounds) has warmed the cockles ot many
hearts. Good luck, we say, and walk m when
the bowler runs up.
Basketball has always been our cup of tca
and thiS year seems to be no exception We
won Inter-lIT and bet on domg It thIS year
too. Our performance m the Inter-collegiate
league has been very good and wah NataraJ
(formerly of the Annamalat UmvefSlty) and
John Chand strengthenmg the heIghts, the
team has real depth. There seems to be a lot
of enthUSiasm for the game and one can't help
feelmg WIth John Mathai that we need a thIrd
Court. A concrete court can give a great
boost to the game. Well, keep trymg and
you may basket n.
The volleyball team IS still recovenng from
the shock of lOSing the skipper Kannan They
have been strengthened by the addlhon of
Syed Masuth and hopefully talk of domg one
bett<.r thiS year (they were runners-up last
December) Spike harder lads and the Cows
WII\ come home.
ThiS year's soccer hopes arc bnghter than
ever before Wtth the effectIVe 4--2-4- system
spearheaded by Verghe~e and Thamburaj, we
began WIth a traIl of vlctnnes over Stanley etc.
Kid stuff you may bay. But the well-mcrlted
draw With Christian was of a nobler upbnngJng. We led tWice and deserved to Wtn.
With the coach bound to return shortly,
Kharagpur may well be toppled, though
Calcutta soccer 18 80methmg qUIte different.

Letter to the Editor
That Awful
Generation Gap
It is generally believed (too damned
obvious) that the PGs· are out of step With
the acttvmes of the Gymkhana. ThIS was
borne out (beyond reasonable skeptiCIsm) at
the Inter-hostel entertainment competItion
last year. ThiS has had repercussIOns In
many quarters. •• and it IS not Without
reason that the PGs are often referred to as
'morons' by the majority of IITlans. But
then ..• where IS the lacuna? Is It the
dlSgw\1.e m attitude (PsychQ-l>OC1al) or t~t~l
lack of mterest 111 the cultural and aesthetic
hfe of the Institute? ThIS problem has
become so notOrIOUS that it would not be
mept to descnbe It as the 'generatIOn gap'.
Commg to thmk of the posslblllties, a
typical PG student would be 'desperate',
, conscIOus' and 'responsIble '-(at least
relatIvely). HIS reSidence adds somethlllg to
Ius way of hfe (Cauvery and Knshna hostel
guys are known for theJr ' presence of mmd '
even m those cncumstances where the OAT
audiences could not suppress their genume
feeltngs of sorts •.. ) But sadly enough, he
has never been an example for the younger
IITtan lfi Statesmanlike qualIties. . • . .
Last year the PG students were represented
the Gymkhana and It was only begmnmg... after sometune It seemed the
begmnmg of the end.
There IS a way out for this burnmg problem .••• and that IS.. . let Ka\'en and
KTlshna hostels be not the monopolIstic
reSidences of the PGs. Let there be proportIOnal strengths of UGs and PGs In
each hostel. Then these would at least be an
atmosphere that would secretly work In them
the ne(:d for a SOCial and cultural life that 1S
accepted by a majority of I1Tlans.

It IS time to bring to light some puzzling
facets of our maugural day. We we1'e startled
to read a rather cryptic notLce the day before
saytng that guest'l were not allowed. As some
first year girls had already been inVited by
their classmates, some agreement was reached
by which the guests were to be the Warden's
guests. S() the Warden could have guests
and the students couldn't. That evenmg
many of us had VISitors whom we kept 111 the
rooms while we went to have dmner. (It was
only then that we came to know that such
• dubIOus' arrangements had been made.)
Wdl, our guests didn't think too highly about
the whok affair.
We wish "to express our severe displeasure
at th{.se unfortunate happemngb. These
comlllg on top of some meaningless rules
about slgnmg a register If you came after
9 00 P m make a mockery of hostL! life. The
authontles should realise that two can play the
game.

A MESSAGE AND INVITATION
FROM mE I. LT. ASTRONOMICAL
ASSOCIATION (IITAA)
(A FOUNDER-MEMBER)

Birth of the liTAA
Nearly two and a half years before, a large
section of the lITlans were pouring mto the
open terraces of Narmada Hostel, day and
mght 111 response to an advcrtlsement Invltl11~ those who were Interested m astronomy
to Jam as an assocIation. The mvItees were
shown telescopIc Views of the mght sky and
gIVen opportunIties to diSCUSS their mterests
111 astronomy.
To most of them It was a
totally new venture and an mteresttng expenence. All of them agreed With the Idea
that an astronomical association would be
hIghly helpful.
The obJecuve for the formatIon of the
lITAA, m a nutshell, was to promote
knov.ledge In astronomy In every pOSSible
way With the combined efforts of the students
and staff of the IlT who are highly qualtfied
111 varIOus SCientific and technological dlsciplmes Thus the IITAA was founded by
Mr. Sathtamurthl with the actlve co-operation
of the IITlan under the prellldency of Dr.
Phil Werner Koch, professor of phYSICS In
the lIT.
History of the HTAA
The IlTAA had Dr. Phil Werner Koch as
Its first PreSident from whom Dr.-lng M.
Bantel took charge as the second PreSident
111 the Sprmg of 1970. Mr. M. Sathlamurthl
was the Founder-Secretary for two years
from whom Dr. Srivastava of Mathemaucs
Deparunent took over slllce AprIl 1971, as
the new Secretary. The IITAA has been
fortunate to get Prof. S. Sampath, the Deputy
Director as Its Vice-PreSIdent.
Activities of the nTAA
The IITAA h.as beeu rneetmg at least tvm:.e
in each month, on the first and thrrcl Tuesdays. The member used to give lectures on
selected tOpiCS 111 astronomy wluch were
followed by analYSIS and dl~cusstons. Apart
from these, a large number of demonstratIOns were conducted dunng several ntghts
• with the aid of several telescopes to explain
the celeshal objects through observattOns.
Two eXhibitions on astronomy were conducted 111 the campus one 111 March 1970 and
anotMr : in ' Apnl- 1971. Non-stop night-sky
demonstratIOns for 3 to 4 contlnUOUS mghts
With the biggest telescopes avaIlable 111 the
City assembled together at liT, were an ex.
cluslve feature oE these exhlbltlOns. WhIle
the first One was general m natlJre, specml
attention to ' RadiO Astronomy' was given m
the second. The exhibitIOns Included charts,
models, photographs, books, mOVies, slides
and other pertment mformatlOn on astronomy.
The exhibitions were financed by the donations raIsed from the students and staff of
the IlT and the voluntary contrIbutions of
the IITAA. members. The IITAA has
fnendly contacts With other mstltutlOns and
Similar aSSOCiatIOns In the City, espeCially from
the V Ivekananda College and Madras
Chnsttan College.
Scope and Prospects
The lIT AA IS plannmg to buy a foreign
made refractor-telescope With arrangements
for photography m the near future hy ralsmg
funds through speCial efforts. The level of
the lectures and diSCUSSIOns Will be gradually
raised. An exhibItIon showmg 'Exploration
of the Moon', as an exclUSIVe feature and a
