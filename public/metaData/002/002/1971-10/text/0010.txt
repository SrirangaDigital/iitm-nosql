CAMPASTIMES

Recently I had to go to one of those many
Government Offices which have sprung up
like mushrooms after the rain to submit a fonn
(see the endless, Impenshable spools of red
tape unwmdmg away) but was told that
nothmg could be done until the chief
who was on a three-week tour of Germany
arne back. Now this seems to me just about
the lunlt of bureaucratIc cowardice. Was aU
the bUSiness of the office to be suspended for
the duration of the top man's VISIt Just because
hiS mferlors at the office were too sacred to
take the responsibility or IS It Just another
scene In the Parklnsoman mghtmare that most
-of our offices seem to be, for that's Just what
these servants of the people are--hvmg examples of Parkinson's laws-movmg 10 a tWlht
world of chaos, ineffiCiency and blunder. May
be all thiS IS Just due to what IS termed the
• IndIan Character', Whose chief virtue or
quahty seems to be cravenness, laziness bemg
a close second, or may be as the amateur
psychologists put It, It IS caused by nearly
three hundred years of slavery during whIch
there grew up III Indians, the natural slave

In a dirty, smelhng street 10 North Madras,
there IS a printer's shop. It Isn't very blgJust two or three thousand sheets a day. A
black painted paper-cutter stands In one
corner Its bright blade hlttmg your eye as you
enter the foom, a few low slung tables crowd
the middle of the room, and In. the opposite
corner there IS the prlntmg machme whose mk
rollers and blocks are operated by afoot-lever.
And so, early every morDlng a man arrives at
the shop, folds hiS dhotJ to hIS knees and
then, wltho~t lookmg at the pile of blank
sheets on the chest-high stool near hIS
machme, he picks up the first sheet, puts
it agamst the block and presses the
pedal. The roUer runs over the ink, the
block moves down, then returns, and the man
removes the pnnted wet sheet, not seemg
what he has Just done, and slffiultaneously
pIcks up another blank sheet and repeats the
process, WIthout pausmg, Without stopping
except for a bIt of nce, untIl the evemng.
H1S 1S the ultimate drudgery.
He IS the perfect machine-WIthout thlnkmg, WIthout
knowmg what he does, he and the mtlhon
others hke hIm throughout the world, carry
out their bondage to the machme every day.
BOBO.

at all-on people, there is no doubt at all that
our UfilverSltles and colleges cont3mlarge numbers of regular and Irregular smokers. Indeed,
ID DelhI the girls smoke hash slttlflg at the tables
of India Coffee House. Personally, I find
nothmg wrong m thIS. After all, no one has
the nght to teU another what IS good for him,
and If anybody feels that he should drop out
of college, go nudist, become a hippie or
smoke pot, nobody-espeCially the Establtshment-has any eay 1D hIS actions. What
matters most IS that one should have the
courage of hIS conVIctions and be true to hiS
deSires and feehngs.

HaVing got that off the chest, let us go on
to another COntention of IDme, that the 50called debates held In lIT and dUring the
Inter-collegiate literary funCtions are not
debates at all but elocutIon contests pure and
Simple. In fact, they could safely be described In the words of the young miss who said
that they were a 'load of crap'. These
guys come up and say something and
half the audience IS sleepIng and the other
half IS boomg. If the tOpiC has somethmg
to do WIth women, some people go up to
the stage, say' I don't want to be vulgar,
but' say a vulgar thmg and then rattle
off the usual chches about woman by the
nature of her functIOns etcetera. Where are
the good old debates where the speakers glare
at <-ach other across an ancient table, funously
scrrbble notes and bang on. the table With their
siJppers whtle the speaker and the spectators
mmute by minute, grow excited and finally
dissolve mto two separate camps-or may be
they Just never happened. ThiS year, may be
we'll try to hold somethmg on the above
