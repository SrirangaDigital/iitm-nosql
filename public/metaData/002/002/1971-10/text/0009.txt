But I was puzzled by the proposal for open
admiSSIOns I found myselt thmkll1g, If anybody could get mto the Umver~lty, why
wouldn't ten thousand, twenty thousand, a
hundred thousand people come here, and If
they did, what would the Umverslty do with
them?
Then one day I found myself thmklng of
the Boston Public LIbrary, whlt-h I go to
quite often, more to borrow classical records
than books. Here IS what must certamly be
cal1ed an educatIOnal institutIOn. Yet It does
not make deCISIons and Judgment about Who
can come In and who cannot, and-what IS
more Important-who IS good enough to come
m and who IS not
It simply says like
libraries everywhere, • Here are some facllltleo-books, records, films, exhibits. If you
want come In and use them, as much as you
want: as long as you want'. I thought of
many other educational iDstitUtions that serve
society, none of whICh exclude anybody, and
It suddenly occurred to me that the admissions
problem of our UniversIties IS not a real problem but a manufactured one-that IS, It
eXIsts because the univerSIties want It to
eXist, not because It has to.
Why shouldn't a school, college, or university be hke a museum, a library, a concert
haIl, a sports faCIlity ~ Why shouldn't It like
them, say to the publIc, 'Here IS what we
have to offer you, here are the posslbllltles.
If they appeal to you, come In and use them,
for as hule or as long as you like.' If more
people want to get In than there IS room for,
let them handle thiS SItuatIOn the way a Concert hall or theater handles It Why not hang
out a sign saymg 'Sold Out-next performance tomorrow afternoon, next week, next
month, next year ,~ 1£ a student wanted to
take a course With Professor So-and-So and
there were hundreds of other students wantlUg

With fewer patIents
Let the student worry about overcrowding.
The Umver"lty can say, we can proVide
university hOUSing for so many thousand
students, after that, people w1l1 have to find
their own Large numbers of students at
Berkeley and other state UniversIties do In fact
bve off campus. ThiS often makes houslOg

both scarCe and expenSive, and thiS may In
turn make a student deCide that a particular
university IS or IS not a good place to go.
But let thiS be hiS worry, not the University's.
If the hOUSing faCIlities, and courses at one
university arc ternbly crowded so that deSirable course~ are hard or nnposslble to get
mto-a~ mdeed they are now In many cases at
places like Berkeley-the student can deCide
elthcr to try to walt It out or to go somewhere
else.
Nor IS there any necessary reason v.hy
umverSltles should ",oery so much about
qualifications. ThiS Will seem starthng at
first But after all, when I borrow a book or
record from the Boston Pubhc Library,
nobody gives me a qUIz to be sure I Will
under~tand It. It's up to me to deCide how I
want to spend my time and to run the risk of
wastmg It. Similarly, If I go to the Boston
Symphony to hear a piece of difficult modern
mUSIC, nobody exammes me In the hall to
make sure I'm educated enough to appreciate
It. I pay my money and I take my chOice.
If I go home later feelmg angnly that It was
a waste of an evemng, all nght, that's my
tough luck. But why should anyone else
make thiS deCISion for me ?
It IS perfectly true that UniversIties of this
kmd would be In Important ways different
from the ones we know today. The unl~ersi­
tIes as they eXist have come to think of
themselves as pnvate clubs. They are In a
race With each other for prestlge, which IS
qUickly translated mto money and powerthe professor from a prestigIOus university has
more chance of gettmg a big foundatIOn or
government grant than a professor from some
less prestigious one. Therefore, they have an
mterest m convInCing the world that thelf
club IS harder to get mto than anybody else's.
At the same time, they try to convince the
oncommg generatIOns of students that
membership m thiS club Will In the long run
prove more valuable-again In terms of
power and money-than membership in
any other That IS what creates the admisSIOns problem I make a great many people
thmk that my club I~ the one to be Ifl, and
then I stand at the door and tell large numbers of them that they aren't good enough to
get ID. On the other hand, smee the Boston
Public LIbrary Isn't trymg to convltlce people
that because It IS harder to get m It IS a
, better' library than the New York Public
Library, It doesn't have to urge large numbers of people to come to It because It IS the
best and then put somebody at the door turmng most of these people away because they
aren't good enough to get tn.
The UniVersIties that conSIder themselves

own supenorlty, and I don't expect them to

would think m other terms.
People ask, what about the grantmg of
degrees? If anybody who wants can come to a
University and there study as much or as httle
as he wantq, how will the ulllversity Issue Its
credentials? 1 don't thmk the unIversity
ought to be In the credentials-granting bUSIness Why should our UniversitIes be hlnng
halls for bUSiness and government? It does
not seem to me to be a Vital or necessary
or even acceptable part of the process of
educatIOn. In any case, people even now take
courses In the extension diVISions of umversltJes and, depending on the length of the
course, get a certam number of credits for
work done. There's no reason at all why
people could not over a number of years take
courses In an assortment of ufllversltles,
depending on where they lived and who they
wanted to study WIth, and SImply have some
kmd of certificate listmg the total number
of credits they had collected In any case,
there IS plenty of eVidence that educational
institutions do not and cannot teach competence. Smce they don't and can't, why go on
any longer WIth the pretence that an academiC
degree IS a certificate of competence? All
It shows or can show IS that such-and-such a
person has taken So many courses and played
the school game for a certam length of tIme ;.
It says nothIng about what he Will or will
not be able to do 111 hIS later workmg life.
The prestige umversltles have worked hard,
for reasons already given, to conVlDce
employers and the pubhc at large that theIr
degrees are Indeed certificates of exceptional.
competence and worth. They have to do thIS
to create among the students a demand for
these degrees and among employers a demand
for holders of them. But It IS a con, and there
is really nothing In It. If the ulllversIties
grew mterested In education they could gIve
up thiS fictIOn along With others.
To the dissatisfied, the UlllverSlues like to
say, m one way or another, 'If yo'\); don't like
our rules, you don't have to play our game'.
ThiS seems the height of reasonableness. It
is nothmg of the kmd The uniVerSities,
which In other cIrcumstances hke to thmk of
themselves sometImes as exclusJve clubs,
sometimes as temples of the higher truth and
learning, are companng themselves here to
any kmd of store. You go to the supermarket, pay some money, walk out the door
With a httle food. If )OU don't like theIr
food or thelt pnces, you don't go to that
supermarket, you go to some other. In the
same way, the llniVersltles say, we offer
certam kmds of learning, skill, and moneyattractIng credenttals, m return for a good
deal of the students' money and tIme. The
trouble With thls~and It should be obvlou~
to anyone who takes half a mmute to thmk
about It-IS that the stores we trade at do not
exercise the kmd of mfluence and pressure on
our hves that the ulllverSltles, smgly and
collectively excerClse on the lives of students.
The supermarkets do not post people at the
