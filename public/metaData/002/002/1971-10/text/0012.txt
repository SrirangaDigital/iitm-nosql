on the experimental verIficatIon of these
predictions.
A new look: A suggestion has been made
to take a quantum mechantcal mode ) of a
person. The clgen values of the characteristic operator H IS supposed to give aU the
pOSSible states (ground state and eXCIted
states). Also It IS mterestlng W notIce the
fact that the elgen values of the multlphcatlon operator HI H2 can be only mtegral
(such as 0, 1, 2, 3, 4 etc) the maxImum
bemg hmlted by the order of the day.

JF YOU HAVE NOTHING TO DO-HERE'S
SOMETHING FOR YOU
The mtncate human being IS best explalOed
If you agree wIth It,
come on Let us proceed, If you don't,
forget about It.
Every person can be represented, III general,
by a complex entzty H where
H = h ' +111." where I = y'-:::"i:
Men differ. You know that best. But
why? Here IS the answer. They vary becauSe their h' and h" factors vary. As sunple
as that.
N ow let us consider the varIOUS possIble
-cases We will classify the persons mto two
dlstI~ct categories, the values of h' and h"
bemg deCISive In so dOIng.
A i For all those who come under thiS
head h" (the Imaginary part) IS so small that
for all pracucal purposes (theorehcal purposes
not excluded) It can be taken as 7ero. Animals,
~f course come under thIS group. Some
human bemg too have thIS prIVIlege.
We WIll make an agreement (agreement
NO.1) that posItive sIgn refers to construction
.and negatIve sign to destructIOn (unless otherWise spectfied).
The real part, in general, can be a Surd
h' = a + :y;b
Sub-group (I) b = 0: Persons belongmg
to thiS type, though lackmg m Imagmatlon,
:are rational. An Ideal (I.e. unheard of)
-example IS, a SIlent pohtlclan People WIth
negative 'a' are cold, calculatmg villams.
Highly constructive people (lIke mel) are
thought to be haV10g a hIgh pOSitive value
• for a.'
S.G. (ll) a = 0, b posItIve persons who
can't Imagme totally lr~onal. No dou~
you would lIke to wnte y' b better as ± y' b.
So these Irrational ones can be destructive as
well. Such people are very dangerous.
B. Here comes the group With large h" and
<Jf course With ordmary values for hi but
negligible In companson With h".
• Lovers, lunatics and poets' along with
sClentlsts and artISts form tlus 1II0St lnteresbng
group.
Needless to say, 11'" can 10 general be a surd
h" = c +
Rere agalll, we agree that positIve and negattve sIgn for h" refers to optimism and
pessUTusm respectively.
(I) C = 0 People who do imagine-but
IrratIOnally. The Shakespearean trw IS a direct
InclUSion to thIS sub-group. Here attachmg
a Sign to y'd doesn't make much difference.
It has been reported, (and Will be discussed a
tutle later) that the factor
varies With time
and space co-ordInates; This In partIcular,
bemg worth nothing. The clasSIC examples
of thiS grQup are said to acqUire a fit of
spmtedness at particular mstants of tJme and
.a partIcular places (obVIously correspondmg
to the extremum values of d).
([1) ThiS IS a group With a large value for
-c. People who are capable of Imagmlllg meantngful thmgs as well as interpretIng them
rationally; or rea)lSmg theIr Imagmauon With
.an admIrable pIece of art. An Emsteln, a
Michelangelo, a Russell-all comb me to make
thIS sub-group a promInent one (It has been an
tnterestlng observation that people of B (11)
batch have 1n them an erratic dlstnbutlon of
factor d too).
So we arnve at a most general representation of a human beIng.
H = [a (x, t) ±
(x, t)
± i (c (x, t)
.L y'd (x, t)
It IS hoped the lOtroductory part given so
far IS not too difficult to understand.

Assrgnment to readers (1) For a particular
value for x and t plot the lOdlvldual probability dlstnbutlon for a, b, c and d.
(2) Plot the tIme varIatIOn of a, b, c and d

Readers are free to enumerate as many coeffiCients as possible, so as to make the problem look more confusmg and open out new
branches of research.
It would be worthwhile introducing a
couple of more terms charactenslng persons.
When a person can multIply, but has got no
smaller factors, we call that person a
pnme.
Squares are usually old fashioned. In fact,
persons who obey UnIverse square law are
always conservative.
OperatIOns WIth people: The primary operation m the case of people IS multIplicatIon.
The result of multtp\!catlon of two people
IS called a product, and multIplYIng persons
are called conjugates, we wIll represent them
by HI and Hz
We come across an Ideal case when Hi and
Hz are complex conjugates of each other.
HI = Hz'" In thiS case the product at the
time of formation would be purely real.
ASSIgnment (4) Give an InterpretatIOn for
the addition of two complex numbers, keepmg
In mmd that the sum of two complex conjugates IS Simply the sum of theIr real parts.
Appearance '-The factor h' is supposed to
playa major role m decldlOg what IS called
the' beauty' of a person The space part of

body.] The
values of the functIOn at mmtma and maxima
give what we would lIke to call 'vital
statistics '.
Mod of a perron :-At this juncture, we
can define a quantity called the mod of a
per<;on. It IS a characteristic length associated
With a person (not to be confused With the
length of side burns or depth of waist hnes).
For example HI = 4
5i IS mod. than
H2 = 1+ 4i
and hence I HI I > I Hz I
Note that In the case of multiplication of
complex conjugates the Mod IS conserved.
ThIS has sinCe been confirmed JIl many
cases.
