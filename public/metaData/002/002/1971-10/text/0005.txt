CAMPASTIMES

Fall 1971]
race alld fast cyclmg. A'S far as
mno~atlOnS go, the problem of
money matters IS always there.
Tl\e committee ~hould also approve.
And about the sWlmmtng pool-smce
a1l new-cowers are ~eally enthusiastiC about It, why not we ask hr
some money from the Students'
AId Fund r Anyway I'm told its
commg.
Q. 4- • Any defects or loopholes In the
sports wmg of the Gymkhana
which, you feel, you might be able
to get nd of?
Am. : Yes, about these PTls here. They
don't do enough work. They 'lTC
not paId enough and they l-OmpJalO
that people outSIde got more. Some
are aheady thmlung of apptymg OU\Side. They don't take enough mterest.
And about these track SUits for
athletes 1 feel all the sportsmen at
the Institute team level should be
prOVided \nth track SUIts and the
ne",.come,s with blazers.
Q. 5 • Don't you thmk thiS system of educatIOn we have here IS bound to reduce
the mterest m sports "I Do you
thmk It \V111 help If we Just have
two cyclel\ of penorucals Instead of
three?
Am. : Yes, I feel the students tak.mg part
In games and sports shotlld either
be exempted from the classes which
clash With melr matches or sports
or they should at least be gIVen
another chance to make up thel!
grades. lIavmg two cycles (both
taken mto account) IS tOO much
and even se\ectlUg the better of the
two IS not adVJsable, stnce then
guys Will have more portIOns to
cover for a particular periodical.
The present systems can contmue
and a rrud-term IS also not adVisable.
Q. 6 : How do you plan to remove or
reduce the bitterness and unhealthy
nvalry among h.ostels wh.en It wmes
to fighttng for the Schroeter?
Am : I feel the Institute secretary should
resign from rus hostel and either
nominate another for the hostel or
call for a hy-electl0n. In thiS way,
the other hostels can fed be IS
neutral He WIll have more tllne
to devote for the Instrtute. OtherWIse, It IS somethmg bke servlllg
twO masters. Schroeter IS a must
and all hostel secretanes should See
that thiS feehng IS not there. 1
have got a plan for draws and fix~
tures
The commJttee
should
consult the captaJn of a partIcular
team. ThIS needs a lot of convmcmg. AU sports seCrlOtaIles must
take mterest and attend meetmgs
once a week.
Q. 7: Anytlung else you would like to say?
Am.
Well, when matChes are held, many
more (mcludmg girls) sn.Q..ud wme
and cheer the team.
Sportsmen
should turn up for regular practice.
Freshers should take more Interest In
the non-medallists' meet and their
sports secretanes should coax them
to attend ThiS year I feel the postgraduates and freshers have started
takmg a lot of mterest. I feel we
should start gettmg coaches tn Sight
now Before the Inter-IIT meet,
I feel three weeks practice IS more
than enough {otherwise It leads to a
sort of plateau feeling, which can be
aVOided) and the rest of the money
can be saved and used for track SUits
and other expenses In thiS year's
Inter-Unwerslty Tournaments
I
expect the table teums, shuttle' and
basketball teams to do well In fiXing
up pomls for the VQ.rlOI1.S g&me5
I feel the commIttee should go In fo;
a m3Jonty deCISion We have also to
look mto problems concerrung markers and other JUnior staff. This jS

So that's how, back in rls, I fir6t met
T. G. Pat'llmeshwaran, or 'Vljayan' as he
desperately wanted to be known. Nowadays
he has come up 10 ltfe-Llt. Sec. and all that
-and VIJay wanted an mtervlew WIth him so
off we went to Tapti, Stnce he got In ~n~
opposed, we were handicapped by the fact
that he hadn't m~de any election promises,
but anyway, we managed pretty wen (at least
that's what we t\1mk \) Flfst question on
Gymkhana ElectIOnS. Should they be all the
one man, one vote baSIS or what? To which
he replted that open electIons would \ead to
large factions and that the present system,
though It was a strain on would-be secretaries
had the advantage of bemg more open and the
dIsadvantage that all the eleven sports secretanes (say) mIght vote for one guy and In the
end, someone else mlght get elected WhICh.
makes mter~secretanes' co-operation as a rule
difficult 1 didn't know he had become a
dIplomat WIthout telhng anybody.
Then we, WIth glat~ and tough stares told
that the prevIOus Literary SecretarIes were
merely figure-heads and organIsers (pretty bad
ones at that) for the stereotyped debates and
qUIZzes, that they dIdn't do anythmg to aroUSe
the hterary enthUSIasms of the great lIT
unwashed and what Was hIS stand gomg to be?
And so, With Ii sheepish grm, Parama t.()!'Iceded
our pomt but pleaded that the system ned hiS
hands real good, because It didn't give the
multitude the time to thmk of anythtng but
periodicals and gradt:s. He suggested that
only two periodical cycles be h~td w\th the
average Ot the best of the two bemg conSidered
for evaluatIon and also that some subjects be
dropped at least for 415 and 515 so that they
might have more ttme to gtve for crelltive
actlVltles. He might have continued for
hours In this vein If we hadn't brusquely
(you can't be too brusque With LIterary
Secretanes and such guys) cut m and asked
hIm not to change the tOPIC and lead US astray
V>'lth VISIonary stuff about bIcycled period\cals
and to tel! Us what he was gOing to do WIthin
the system. Ills answer was the usual and
expected-we'll try to hold more competitions
get lectures-well you kll,ow the type. It l~

fobbing off unpleasant questIOns-promISe

Some more pomts he made: The average
IITlan ~acks ail political conscIousness and
finally that most MadrasiS tend to regard
IlTlans as snobs, WIth whIch mterestmg pIec:e
of knowledge, the pow-wow ended.

After a faIrly successful} ear as Social Secretary
of Alakananda, he lay low for a whIle playlllg

Q, Hullo Ifti, how do y()\.t feel, n(}w that it's

an over ~

A. It was an exhJlaratmg expenence and all's
wen that ends well.

Q.

Do you think tOSSlDg of the com after
the tie m your electIOn was faIr?

A.

FaIr or not, It was ID the game. The
rules you know, and I did nOt mllld It a
bIt.

Q.

Does it ~ot in effect Ulvalidate the fifty
votes regIstered?

A. In a way

It ooes, yes. 1 do not approve
of such all, alternative and In a contest
