'Campastimes
Meets the
Gymkhana'
An amazmg mixture of gestICulatIOns and
adjectives spelhng out cUriously flat and
unconviDcmg trUIsms mlxed with mClslve
thrusts of good sense. a carefully fostered
Image of smcenty which bears any attack and
above all a gnawiDg phIlosophy of actIOn,
seemmg to attempt speeds much faster than
the words suggest; Mr. Vmod Bh.ltla m the
final reckomng IS the students' hope, the
Estabhshment's Itch (though not a pam, one
fcels) and the cartoomst's dream.
The smcenty IS Immediately apparent as
your Editor mildly upset by the new<; of
Mr Bhatia's mdlsposItlOn IS told that nothmg
on earth need postpone the mtcrvlCW, though
as the mtervlew goes on, your EdItor can't
help feehng at times that the pressure IS on and
Ideas aren't as logIcally hned up as one would
expect.

We Start:
PNV: What do you thmk was the chief reason
behmd your success?
VB : The Ideals that I stood for; populanty
doe~n't come Just hke that, nothmg
more was there.
PNV: What do you think of the present
system of electmg the Gymkhana?
VB : The present system IS defimtely an
unprovement on the last year's. has
been welcomed by all sectIOns smce
the prevIOus electorate was too small.
PNV: What do you thmk of the pohcy of one
man, one vote ?
VB . That IS somethmg whIch I have
alv.ays stood by. 2,000 IS not too large
an electorate. The chief objectIOn
IS that It IS on a massIve scale.
But !Jl the class rep. electIOn, m
the space of ... hrs. nearly thousand
came and voted; which bas neveT
happened before. Even, III the first
year B Tech. election 90% of votlllg took place. If elected that way,
the students elect the secretary
straightaway. I wll1 try to pursue
thiS further.
nP; Do you thmk the Ladles' Hostel should
be gIVen 4 votes ?
VB : No. 4 years back, they had only I
vote. But then the CommIttees
were chosen by 10 hostels and to
break the tie, the Ladles' Hostel was
mcluded. Their '\trength has not
gone up conSIderably to demand
4 votes.
PNV: Do you thmk there should be any
change III the procedure of electmg
hostel secretanes ?
VB : These electIOns ehmmate good candidates. In my Idea, the hostels wIll
have their own secretanes who have
nothmg to do WIth the Gymkhana.
For example last year, both Narendra
and Victor ThamburaJ stood. So
one had to be ehmmated which was
unnecessary. Another advantage of
havmg dIrect electIOn to the Gymkhana IS that you can't convince
2,000 people overnight.
PNV: I suppose you will be makmg efforts
to realIse your obJectives.
VB : Certamly
PNV . Why not have elections at the end
of the year?
VB . Nice Idea. But there is the question of
the tIme mvolved and It wJlI mterfere
with the exammatJons; also the
prevIous year's students might have
a vested lJlt~rest, If a secretary got
elected mamly WIth the help of final
years, he cannot claIm to be In the
maJonty the next year.
PNV: What do you thmk of the last year's
Gymkhana?
VB : The annual routme thmgs they did
well, but they dIdn't satisfy the
asplratlons of all the students; they

CAMPASTIMES
didn't bother about student problems: a body for tacklmg student
problems IS the Gymkhana.
PNV: You have often talked of fightmg the
Estabhshment. What do you mean
by the EstablIshment? Can you
Identify It?
VB
What I meant by it IS there IS among
the staff a section that does not constder the students an entity at aU.
Whatever the lIT may be, It IS
a place meant for students. That
sectIOn treats the students as worse
than dirt and thIS IS what I propose
to fight. I have to give the students
a sense of Identity. In my opllllOn
they don't have It now. ThiS fight
engulfs all the people who are gomg
to block our bid to seek Justice,
whatcvcr lflJustlce eXists agamst the
students
PNV . What are the specml problems on
which you are gOing to fight the
Estabh<;hment ?
VB ; FIlm club for one thmg; It has not
been a happy expenence at all; but
my efforts WIll be general; first try
discussion, then persuaSlOn. Any
problem of the students IS a problem
of the Gymkhana.
PNV: Have you any Idea of attemptmg to
change the ExammatlOn system?
VB ; The present system IS far better than
what It was; penodlcals I well,
opinIOns vary; but there 1$ very
httle scope for manoeuvnng; the
whole thmg IS too ngld; there IS
no place for dOing anythIng extraordmary The plIght of sportsmen
IS bad and there seems to be no way
of clrcumventmg It. I WIll make
a move towards gettmg academiC
conslderatlOns for outstandmg sportsmen Periodicals give too much
leverage to the staff; not only Just
the chap who evaluates you but
for all people who don't get on well
With you, I OBJECT TO THE
MISUSE OF THE
SYSTEM
THAN TO
THE
SYSTEM
ITSELF.
PNV; â€¢ A student body that does nothing IS
worse than the worst estabhshment'
-Please comment.
VB : Our prevIous Gymkhanas have substantiated that. So far III the last
12 years, the only people who have
done anythmg are the secretanes.
The student body has been III
oblIvlOn.
PNV: Do YOIl thmk students can strike
to redress therr grIevances?
VB : I don't advocate strikes for strikes'
sake. But If all the students are
convmced and the authorlttes don't
Yield, then I won't heSItate to call the
students to demonstrate to express
themselves. There hasn't been a
strike In IZ years. It IS better if we
don't break the record. I hope the
authOritIes are senSible enough.
PNV : There IS a school of thought that
holds that the student Gymkhana
IS at present powerless
Do you
agree? What do you propose to do
about It )
VB : It IS so. People expect me to get
more power for them. I have been
told m so many words that I should
set thmgs right.
PNV: Do you thmk students should be given
representations m the Senate?
VB : That was one of the campaign promises of my opponent. If the student
IS merely an observer there, there is
no use. It will be Worse than now
smce we WIll get only the blame.
I am thmkmg about It.
PNV. Have you heard Campus radicals?
VB : No. What IS It? (At thiS stage. a
short diverSion on the baSIC polICies
of Campus RadIcalIsm .IIke sit-illS
was made. Then Mr. BhatIa con.
tmued.) I thmk such things should
be aVOIded. But that doesn't mean
we can take everythmg lymg down.
