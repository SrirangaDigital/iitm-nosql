CAMPASTIMES
What other alternative would you
suggest?
Well, a re-election would not have been
very easy I \\ould have left the deCIsion
to the other elected Secretanes. It IS
reasonable to expect them to elect WiSely,
knOWing that thiS guy hall got to work
with them, for them.
Isn't the present mode of electing the
External AffaIrs Secretary from one of the
class representatives, a bit anom31ous ?
That IS the way It IS. Tile class representatIve~ form the External Affairs Committee and naturally someone IS reqUIred
to head the team. Of course, there could
have been an entirely different committee
for External Aftalrs, much like the other
CommIttees and Secretanes. But I think
It would amount to thc same.
really
don't know. It has never been tned
before.
Sarayu has more votes in Its pockets
than IS necessary-Comment.
Statistically speakIng, the girls are overrepresented. But I am not complamIng.
What are yout vIews on the present mode
of electIon-53 guys votlllgr
It IS defimtely a change for the better
lind IS hkely to brmg about more harmomous worktng of the Gymkhana
Can you rule out the possibIlity of
fnction wlthm a particular commIttee
Itself when more than forty guys who
have no partlcular lnterest In the election
of secretary of that committee?
It mIght happen that a partIcular guy who
IS not popular with hIS own committee IS
elected to head the commIttee. Then no
mode of election IS fool-proof.
How would you lIke unIVersal franchise?
Would the results have been much
different then?
Umversal franchise besides bemg a costly
effort would mean a slIghtly less Intelhgent electorate. It would also Involve
more tIme, campaIgn costs, more effort,
more convmcmg to be done. I dou.bt Its
practicabIlIty. Hardly anythmg would
have been dIfferent as regards results.
What do you mtend domg thiS year as
External Affairs Secretary? Not much
work has been done by the prevIOUS
commIttees.
That has been so because thiS committee
had no defined field of operlltlon. I propose to glve myself and my members
scope of Independent action. The other
committees of course have to co-operate
in thiS. I t is certaIn that not much can
be accomplIshed Without the understandmg from other Secretanes.
Redefining your sphere of aCtiVIty, then
what)
Get down to work. All these years,
no One has trIed to establish any lastmg
relations With outside colleges. We only
know of a debatmg team, a quIZ team,
comIng from yonder. I would lIke to
change thiS. The problem IS that these
COntIngents hardly ever know anythIng
of the lIT and the I1TIans. All they
know about IS the CL T and a few
Secretanes. I feel, a lmk.-up at a more
1ndlvldual, personal level IS what we
need, Wh2t we seek. I would lIke to
convene a meetIng of the general
secretaries of all the colleges to work out
solutIons of problems of mutual Interest.
What do you thInk IS the role of the
Gymkhana In the Campus?
It IS baSically a student orgamsatlon by
the students etc., meaning, to represent
the student body III all matters of Its
COnCern. It has not yet Come to the
level of bemg a student representation
WIthIn the framework of the EstablIsh_
ment. We propose to bnng about a
gradual change In thiS connectIOn.
Have you anythIng else to say In your
capacity as the head of the class representatIves commIttee?
Yes. It has been proposed that we try
for, and got a break of say IS mInutes
or 20 mInutes after the first two hours
III the mornIng.
I know exactly how
many of us feel the need tor such a
break III the course of the mornmg.

Why dId you stand?
Because I felt I could do a reasonably
good Job.
Any other motives?
No other motives.
What do you feel about the present
met\\od of electIon of Gymkhana r
The object of any electIon should be to get
a guy up there who can do a good Job
workIng WIth hiS committee. With the
present system thIS year's system the
Secretary may stand up Without any
support from hIS commIttee So the
purpose of the committee IS defeated.
What do you thmk made you WIn ?
The fact that I am me
No egOIsm mtended
The Idea of one man one vote
You mean for all the Gymkhana posts?
Not only for the General Secretary?
That IS, the hostel posts being elected
by the hostel guys and the Institute posts
by all the guys In lIT. ?
(pause) Give me a fag.
No I don't lIke It.
Why don't you lIke it ?
For two reasons.
First of all the present system has
generally been found to elect able guys.
Secondly, It bOlls down to the same
thIng I said a few mInutes ago. The
secretary may not get to-operation from
hIS commJttec.
Suppose thiS year all the guys in lIT
were votmg, would you have stood for
the post?
Yes.
Do you thlllk that the ladies hostel should
be given 4 votes ?
No.
Why?
Because the number of tnmates in the
Hostel does not warrant the same
number of votes as any other hostel.
How many votes would you lIke them to
to have ~
From th.e proportionality pomt of viewone.
Did you feel that last year saw much
activity III your sphere?
You mean, did take part?
Not necessanly, that IS, was there much
work done by the committee by way of
entertainment?
Ans' No.
What are your plans for thiS year?
Nothmg concrete as entertamment 18
generally an ad hoc affair but I plan one
more entertaInment than last two years.
What elt1ra entertawment do you plan to
gIVe than that we had last two years?
Go ahead, make me commit myself.
You mean you are WrItIng all this? (Of
course, your first reaction to each
question IS most Important, Secretary.)
It shou\d be pOSSible to get the city
colleges to entertalll us once III a while.
shall also try to get a few bIg-shot
entertalllers to gIve guest performances
as and when they VISit town. A general
face lIft for our stock of musical Inlltruments also seems 10 order.
(Another fag).
I bdleve there is quite a lot of mUSical
talent I~ the Institute which reqUIres
encouragIng.
Do you propose to discover talent among
freshers ?
FIrst, from the two SOCial secretaries of
the first year hostels. ThiS Will have to
serve the purpose for the Gymkhana
Inaugural.
Afterwards, the hostel entertamment
should he the best gUIde.
I feel that last year the music room was
In a very very bad state.
What do you
plan to do about It?
As far as the mstruments themselves are
concerned, If money IS sanctioned I plan
to rep\enlsn the stock to a certaIn extent
I also propose to appOint by rotatIOn on~
SOCial secretary of a hostel per month to
be In-charge of the mUSIC room. Anybody who wants to take an Instrument
out Will have to approach the member In
charge through the SOCIal secretary of hIS
hostd.
