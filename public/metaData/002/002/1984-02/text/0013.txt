a dull sensadon of numbness, as he lrloked out through the temple gates to see the young schoolgirls walking
past the temple. How he craved to run out and live a life for himself, a life that would let him be master.
That afternoon he was not present for lunch! That evening, he was caned! He felt humiliated in front of aLL
his "docile coward" friends. The head pdest told him of how he had been found a derelict scavenging among
streets. amidst the garbage, and how he had been provided this God-given home to live a comfortable life in and how he was misusing it now. The young truant thought of telling him to let him live the life that God had,
originally proposed for him, but he restrained himself, as he knew the anger and insult these words would ignite.
That night. the young fellow stole all he could from his simple companions, stole some money from the
priest's room, and left in the earlier hours of dawn. The buds were in as much a stupor of sleep as the inmates
of the monastery, but one little sparrow cocked open one eye, stirred, shifted and felt asleep again.

Two days of acute hunger brought him to earth with a painful thump. Two days of begging for a job taught
him all about the cruel world, two days of worldly lift, taught him the hardships of trying to enjoy adolescent
pleasures, two days of insult made him realise how melodious the entire atmosphere of the temple had been, two
days of sickness taught him all about the. cherubic health that was God, two days of blind wandering caused him
to realise that the priest was not only master, but also God himself in human attire - his only path to salvation. He decided, ashamedly, to return!

The sky was dark and it rained lightly. The young boy was feverish and delirious. All his youthful and
sprightly resistance had buckled up. He reached the gates, and his fear, guilt and sorrow converged upon him ~~
a searing pain. His chest drummed, and his wet sticky hah told only too'well of the wetting he had recei"~d all
night. His stomach was grumbling desires. He looked all around - even the early rises were in bed (o~ the
floor) - his mind touched the warmth of his rough blanket. He cursed himself at' not having brough~ that out too,
and he cursed himself for all he had done. His head spun as he recognised the gates. He cli~~~d over, his heart
thumping in anticipation, and ran straight towards the temple door, which he could only discern by the shrouded
moonlight. On the way he stumbled and his head hit the ground. A stab of agony was all he felt, fot it was
almost indiscernible amidst all his pain.
The water fell in dewy drops upon his matted hair from the tips of the fresh green leaves, now as dark as
the ominous and yet virgin morning. He rose uncertainly, and made for the temple door. He slept.
For some time, he d~eamt of beautiful women and of an independent life, of money and wealth, of power! Then
he dreamt that he was standing all alone in the temple hall, a lone la~p burning in front,of him near t~e diet Y
flickering into the regal facial expressions. He smelt the clouds of lncense tnat were rIslng upwar@s 1n splra t s,
sometimes streamlined, sometimes distorted. The clouds suddenly formed themselves into a head - the h~ad ?f the,
head-priest, his fiery eyes like burning embers in his face, blood oo~ing out thro~gh the c?rners ?fhh~Sb~J~~~ hlS
cane dancing in the air. He saw his companions laug~ out loudly at,hlm. and s~whh1~self,belng ~~n~~ticea' the
