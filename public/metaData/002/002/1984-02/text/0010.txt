to ~n my dance, the visual concept is totally
.mdifferent (from the traditional). When I
choreograph a piece, I conceive it as a piece

with the background •.. a stage ••• and I visualize some one dancing. Then I consider the
patterns of movement .•• one movement evolves
into the other.
"In my group dances, I use diagonals, I
go in circles, I use parallels, I use triangles.
These were not there when I learnt from my

quite cold"
What is Visweswaran's role in your dancing career? "My appreciation of music - Western ana
Indian -has increased ten-fold after marrying him. Just as he has learnt a lot about dance,
I have learnt a lot about music from him ...• People tell me that he also makes friends very
easily - which is very necessary in my field."
T~e impatient sou~ding of a fiat horn had regularly interrupted the quick passage of time
