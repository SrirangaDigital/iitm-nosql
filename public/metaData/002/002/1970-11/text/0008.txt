Take Tubmgen.
It IS a small town, 70,000 or so mhabttants,
about 12,000 of them students; on the banks
of the Neckar, with a not-qulte-so-old castle
on a hilI and crooked lanes In the ancIent quarters' the language IS Swablan, a couple of
chur~hes, lots of pubs they say It'S beautiful.
And there are 2. theatres. The Landestheater,
rather heavily subsidIZed keeptng up, more
or less, the occident's theatrical heritage,
tours the countryside once or tWice a week,
customary plays for subSCription-customers,
the treasure of tradition for the rushcs Not
only for them
the programme In town too IS
sohd hlstnomcs, approved claSSICS from the
old Greeks to Schiller, Shakespeare and yes,
Brecht. Expenments m the scope of the
ell.pected
Das ZlInmertheater, shghtly subSIdized,
seatmg about lOO - the entrance IS an art
gallery, the personnel mostly under-30 The
touch of boheme IS enttcmg, the parties after
the premieres are famous, nOISY, and last
till breakfast. Though the curriculum IS
different from that of the Landestheater, the
baSIC Idea IS SImIlar fun and games, art as
dehverable goods, exactmg entertamment for
the fastidious; authors of the last 20 years,
Slawomlr Mrozek and Harold Pmter, John
O~borne and Peter Handke, Fernando Arrabal
and Michel de Ghelderode, Samuel Beckett,
Ramer W. Fa,9bender, Gunter GratS , bra my
dialogues and stunmng stage dlCectlOn, art IS
gag, III other words.

About 4 years ago the ZllDmertheater staged
the latest news
Peter Handke's 'Pubhkumsbeschlmpfung' (Insultmg the Audience).
The actors abused the spectators, told them how
stupid, thick, neurotiC, cuckoldy, blurpy and
ugly they were, that they had only corne from
thetr dmner tables to agam Sit complacently
on their fat bottoms, unable to DO anythmg,
told them they were mtellectually mert, physI{JaIly awry, generally a waste, and asked them
why they dIdn't get lost_ True or not, the actors
had memoflzed thetr hnes and were runnmg
1n Circles to deliver them. But when frIend
Alberts and my humble self responded to
the Imphed challenge of our dormant creatIvIty and climbed on the stage, talkmg, and
fumbllllg With their tape-recorder (which
proHded their clues and background-musIc),
they felt they had to stop us as we Jeopardized
their well-rehearsed display of wrath. So we
sat down and uttered short, hystertcallaughs
We had witnessed a staged paradox. We
were on tnal for bemg consummg, nonacting dImwits, but as soon as we acted, the
trIal could not be performed. It was what the
educated amongst you would call an APORIA.
They threw a great party that ntght.

THE CLASSICS AND THE
MUSHROOMS
The European Renaissance had brought to
man the awareness of himself unrelated to
God. Though still religIOUS, he started
feeling Independent and able to cope With
hIS problems WIthout help from beyond.
The ClasSical Theatre IS a subsequent
mamfestatlon of man's Importance for man.
Racine and Comedic m France, Schiller
and Lessmg and Goethe and Kletst and
Hebbel In Germany. The German claSSICS
stnved, In the framework of Idealtsm mhented
from Plato, for the morally best shape man
could give himself. ThIS ImplIed man's
capabilIty of free own Will. The Issue was
what man SHALL.
For the stage It meant the utmost Importance of the speech The rcalm of morals and
thought, that IS, the realm of Ideas, can only
be mamfested In words. The World that
matters, the world of emotion and deCISIOn
the IIlner world of man, happens as speech '
One ImphCahQn IS that, as the essence of
being can bL verbaltzed, the words arc the
essence. Idea and the name of the Idea arc
[dentlca/. The word IS reality. (The filter

between consciousness and language and
between thmgs and language, was not yet
discovered)
Hence man is Identical With what he says.
Hence man IS able to fully commUlllcate hiS
essenCe
Then came the 19th century and With It the
doubts Let me quote Hugo von HofmannsthaI from hiS Letter to Lord Chandos as
an example. 'The words decayed III my
mouth Itke mouldy mushrooms.' ThiS sentence SIgnalled the CriSIS of the Word,
wluch still lmgers.
Language turned
lIladt-quate, and, what [S more, ceased to
be trusted With carrymg the essence.

THE WORLD, A SHAMBLES-THE
THEATRE OF THE ABSURD
If words are no longer suffiCient tr;lnsport
for meamng, 11 need not be words that fall.
It can be the meanmg whIch refuses to be
transported
In other words
when the
systems of order, and therewith the co-ordlnatmg concepts of thought, fat! to analyse and
explain the world suffiCiently, then by
necessity the words III which they were
expressed fall to explain the world suffiCIently.
When, moreOVer, the tradItIOnal system of
co-ordmatlon and explanation falls, then the
meanlllg Imphed and prOVided by thiS system
fads. As !tfe IS explaIned III terms of such a
system, the falhng of the system makes
life mealllngless The system had supplied
the purpose now there IS no purpose.
The system had supphed the values now
there are no values. The sy~tems had supplted
the accepted patterns of behaVIOur and
assessment now these patterns are not.
As tradItIOnal theatre was by way of
language reId ted to a system, the fadmg
system made thiS theatre unrelated, that IS :
meanlllgiess.
All thiS means III hlstoncal terms
When
the system of co-ordmatlOn and order and
values, whIch had prevatled in Europe upto
the l8th century (and In some regIons and
SOCIal strata stili prevails), Chnstlalllty became insuffiCient for many thmkers and
artists (the suffenng they could not reconCile
WIth a merciful God) the wars could not
be mterpreted In terms of Chnstlan behef,
each of the contestmg armies pleadmg the
celestial bhss on theu weapons, the difference of chances of purSUIt of happmess they
could no longer argue away by the promises of
paradise for each In a world to come), they
sought for others RATI01\lALISM \\as the
reactIOn to the nratlonal appeasement of the
tradItional opmton-leaders, the enlightenment,
rooted III ancient Greek philosophy, started
With the Renaissance; Descartes' thundering
challenge to all and every kllld of transcendentalists 'COglto, ergo sum; I thmk, therefore
I am' put the sCientIfic, enlightened, ratIOnal
as the only
approach m ItS proper place
worthy way of analYSIS
After a hundred or so years of the 'age
of reason', It became obvlou~ that reason
failed to stop wars, suffermg, mjustlce. More
refined ratlOn ..l systems were offered Darwm's phjlogenetlc
explanatIOn,
Marx's
economIcal expl.lIlatlon, Freud's psychological
explanation AccompanYlllg them all the tIme
were reactiOns of the IrratIOnal the system of
rIgid chauvlIllsm which led to World War I,
the outbursts of fascism In the 20th Century
With their IrratIOnal apotheOSIS of raCism, the
myth of blood and SOil, and so on and so
forth None of these could or would prevent
the next to final catastrophe of World War II.
In the early 40S of this century each and
every beltef In the humalllty of human
beings, m the progressmg evolution to a better
betng, III the man-started movement towards
hapPiness, III a lovlllg and protectmg God, had
brokt-fl down Llc.. was mcalllngless. Values
were dtstro)ed The world was absurd,
deVOid of reasonable purposes and left alone
by "hatt-vcr ktnd of metaphYSical prmclple
one could assume.

[November 1970
All thiS, of course, apphed only to a certam
sectIOn of mankmd. To thiS section belong
the eXlstentlah~ts In France. AlbcI t Camus
wrote In 1942. m hiS My the de Slsphe (Myth
of Slsyphos)
'A world, which call be
explatned, albeit by in~uffic[ellt reasons, [S
a famlltar world. In a unIverse, however,
which suddenly IS bereft of the IllUSions and
of the light of reason, man feels ltke a stranger.
From thiS eXile there IS no outlet, because m
It there IS no memory of a lost home and
no hope for a promised land ThiS separation
of man from hIS itfe, of the actOI from hIS
background, IS precisely the sensatIOn of
absurdity'
And m hiS essay on Franz Kafka the playwrtght Eugene Ionesco defines what he
understands by the term 'absurd'
• Absurd
IS somethmg whIch IS Without aim , As
soon as man IS detached from his lehglOuB,
metaphYSical or transcendental roots, he IS lost,
hiS aCl/ons are futIle, absurd, useless, Illpped
In the bud'
Thus It can eaSily be understood that Camus
In 1942 coolly put the question why man
should not escape IIlto SUICide <\Iready thiS
sentence shows, and the plays of Camus
and Sartre show even more d[stmctly, that the
eXlstentlaltsts, though not beltevmg III any
baSIS of eXistence other than the eXistence
Itself, sull expressed thClr dlsbeltef In clear
and rationally tntelllgible terms. In fact
their plays prove the absurdity of eXistence In
most lUCid, log[cal and well organlLed sequences of thoughts; this IS thelf mward
that they expressed the failure
contradictIOn
of all analytical (and thereby meanmgful and
essential) systems by the thoroughly meanmgfu} and essentIal system of theIr language.
Now the playwrights of the absurd convey
the ab~ence of mtcLhglblltty 1Il the world by the
absence of ratIOnal wteiltglblhty III their plays.
The eXIl>tentlahsts explam the absurdity, the
authors of the thc?tre of the absurd PRESENT
It. Samuel Beckett's 'Waltmg for Godot'
allows no conclUSIve reduct/on of the play to
that which the play
a couple of statements
may mean beyond Itself cannot be expressed
otherWise than by the play.
As one example let me teU you the plot m
On an Island a
Ionesco's 'The Cha[rs'
95-year-old man lives together With hIS wue
of 94. The couple walts for the arrival of
qUite a few well-reputed persons, to whom the
old man wants to dehver hiS message, which
IS the summing-up of the expenences of hiS
long hfe. As the old man IS not a good
speaker, he has lllvited a profeSSIOnal orator to
convey the message.
The guests arrIve, or do- they? Anyway,
on the stage the old couple collect more and
more chaIrs, III neat rows, all the tune welcomlllg the guests WIth most courteous
platItudes. The crowd grows, only with
dIfficulty can the couple weave through the
rows and rows of chairs. Everythmg IS ready
for the orator. And mdeed he comes, a man
of fle~h and blood. Content that hIS message
Will be conveyed Immediately, the old man
together WIth hiS wife drowns hImseff In
the sea_ The orator turns to the empty
chairs and tnes to speak, but he IS deaf and
thute and can only utter pathetically ullintelhglble sounds. Then he writes somethmg
on the blackboard, but It IS only a meanmgless collectIOn of letters. Curtam.
• The Chairs' apparently IS a metaphor.
Or IS It a parable? A simile? And what
does It stand for ~ Well, pnmanly for Itself;
multidImenSional, complex, ambiguous play.
It cannot be translated Into other languages.
The possible InterpretatIon IS left to the
spectator. The Imposslblltty to hand down
experience through generatIOns? The uselessness of (the old man's) hfe? The nothlllgness
of spectators?
Most of the plays of the absurd of the first
generation were wntten III Pans and staged
In Pans for the first time by Beckett, roneseo,
Jean Genet, Jean Tardlcu, Arrabal. But the
fashIOn, If It was one, pervaded all Europe_
Gunter Gra{:l wrote' StIll ten mmutes till
Buffalo' and' The evtl cooks', Max Frisch
'Biedermann und die Brandstlfter' (The
worthy and the mcendlanes), Wolfgang
Hiideshclmer dabbled a httle m the absurd,
and even Fr'ednch Durrenmatt has a touch
of It m some of hiS play, But on the whole,
thIS type of drama has not found a great
author III Germany. The stages, though,
abounded m It, and stili do to some extent.
