It's Saturday evenmg
And tltey'relall sad.
Why are they sad?
Because they have to man the OAT gates
And that's all they ever get to do.

speCies, which has bt'gun In recent centunes,
until finally we shall be left by ourselves m
our concrete Jungles, with the domestic dog,

These two characters form the bulk but not
the whole and we need to understand two

studies French and Western MUSIC With cookmg of Bondas as her spec tal subject She
speaks Enghsh fluently and refers to Harold
Robbll1s' heroes by their ChrIstian names.
But as far as the world IS concerned she IS
lost and hence does not eXist. To her' these

really too bad,' she whispers to 'Bobby'short for Bhuvaneshwan-as she drives her

The last of these characters IS really a delta
character but cruCial nevertheless He IS
BaJasubramaman. He IS very good at makmg
the grade. He corrects the lecturer often and
spends hiS spare Hme brOWSIng In the lIbrary.
He has not heard of T. S. Ehot or Valery
Brumel. But the gnawmg drawback In hiS

leaders capable of? They can't even solve
a differential equation. They can only agitate
for more bus-stops.' HIS crushing cymclsm
and abommable indIfference make him an
outSider m hIS own land.
HaVing understood tht'se four types it is
not difficult to draw conclUSIOns from those
two despIcable escapades. Sandhya Subramamam reads of successful fancy fetes

Without "tid creatures, we shall have to exchange our attitudes for others conSiderably
less selfish and Irresponsible. We shall have
always to bear III mind that the smallest of
our a<:t1Ons can have a profound negative influence on \\lld hfe, \\e shall have al\\ays to
hmlt our own numbers, so that we do not
have to encroach further on terntones occupied
by wild Itfe, we shall have to begm the all out
Job of lducatmg every mdiVldual, even the
most die-hard, so that Wild bfe conservation

support and enthUSiastiC back1l1g they WIll

creatures that share the planet With us today,
so that they may be for our children the catch

that they are for u,.
All day, and part of the nIght, I have
sat wntmg and rewntlllg, prompted by a
poster seen on a bus There does not seem
to be much else to say I shall bow out on
the thought that, If Our lIT has a shm chance
of becommg legitimately famous, there bemg
so many other comparable and better InstItutions, It has qUite a chance of acqumng another sort of name. If the black buck falls to
make It to safety, we shall go down m the
books of the naturahsts, and be remembered,
forever after, as one of the final contnbutory

politiCians to raise funds for thei~ husbands'
elechons. She thmks she can do the same
m India. When she does so, she opens the
gate to all the frustrations pent up ID KK
and Praveen Gupta. The rest IS logical, in
fact, mevltable. In a society where there IS
very little Violence, a football final IS a godsend To thmk of It as a sportmg tussle
between two Institutions playmg a glOrIOUS
game IS Just above the Phmsoll-hne of KK
and Praveen Gupta All their pseudo-patnotIsm and misplaced valour come out in a
grand show of strength at the match, their
medIOCrity eggmg them to be different for
a change. HaVing never heard of such thmgs
as fight-backs and recovenes, they see the
game as a mlmature political platform in
which might WInS the fight.
As these events go on, the mtellectual
broods m hiS lIbrary; shrugs hiS shoulders as
he reads about them In the papers. He could
have become the PreSident of the Umon and
seen to It that order was malntamed. But
like Yudlshtara, hiS chartot does not touch the
ground. In the final reckonmg, he IS the
person most responsible for all thiS as he IS
the only person capable of changmg It.
An exaggeratIOn? Perhaps. But creauon;
no, never. Madras IS tYPical of an Indian
Ul11Verslty, Its frustratton, mediOCrity and
cymCism havmg their counterparts everywhere. As students m Tokyo, Pans and
Berkeley agitate to change their social
structure, and alongSide It, run faster, throw
farther and Jump higher than anyone else lfi
the world, the Indian student smks deeper
and deeper Into the rut, hiS society vamly
lookmg to him for the lead that It so badly
needs.
