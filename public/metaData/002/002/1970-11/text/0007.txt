One thmg I will tell you-if there IS anybody who reads thIs column, It certamly
isn't the Estabhshment. Just to re-mflate
my ego, maybe they don't read Campastlmes
at all. WhIch makes thIs column about as
effective as suckmg out your tongue at a bhnd
man. The last few sentences are all In aId of
emphaslZmg the fact that If those concerned
dId Sit back and read about the Co-operatIve
Stores, they probably treated It as an exercIse
m humour, nothmg more. So everythmg
contmues just the way It used to be.

THB LIBRARY

Portrait 01 an Artist

Ought to appreclate a good thIng when we
see It. The Liblary IS one of the few sectIons
m the Institute whIch has been steadIly
Incorporatmg new Ideas Into Its work mg.
The Book Bank has been started off, though
on a mInute sCdle. Future plans Include
acqulflng five hundled standdfd tItles, each
In sufficlellt Ilumbers. Probably means that
Mr. Nazar Ahmed needs finance. While he
IS trymg to wangle It out of the Director, we
wandel why the students shouldn't do somethmg to help hIm. Collect some money,
perhaps. or maybe respond enthUSiastically
to hiS request for contributIOns of books.

PIcture a young man, tn hiS tWentIes,
elegantly dressed, sprawlmg on a dIvan,
surrounded by paintIngs sculptures, object
d'art, what-have-you. ObvlOusly enormously
nch. Hah J you snort (If you are the snorting type)-one of the Idle nch and a dIlettante
to boot. But there you are wrong. Wheels
are turnlllg, gears falltng, and ratchets-dOlllg
whatever they do-m that head of hiS.
Words and phrases flItted through his
mmd.
The tavern of the mind, the memory of a
dream, the dream of a memory. Too trIte,
too common WIsh I had a story to stnng
them together
But the Imaglllatlon is
cramped and all I can do IS cook up some
empty phrases, mcanmgless strmgs of words.
No feelmg. The canyons of the mmd-a Ime
from a song. The ram fell m large, spatterIng drops and the fUrIOUS WInd rattled the
wmdow-panes of the old, ramshackle house.
Lo\ely beglllnmg for someone ltke Poe. Or
Edgar Wallace for that matter. All that's left
Is the skeleton of a memory. Memory,
memory. The word echoed and reached Ill.
Well, why not, the canyons of the mInd.
That's all I have left now, he thought Damn,
damn , Just lIke me to brmg out a chche lIke
that I But It'S true, though. Remember that
poem-somethlllg-and oh It's true, It'S true.
The memory motIf agaIn , Another Marcel
Proust, perhaps l To try somethmg else-why
not eXistentialIsm. Look at Sartre I Or the
stream-of-consclOusness. And look at the
kind of thmgs Becket gets away WIth' (NamedroPPlllg IS a very useful ploy, espeCIally In
lIterary Circles.) The magmficence of the
past and the squaltclty of the future The
Present-words, words, Just words, God!
what a mess J
He smiled.
Perhaps I'll be able to wnte somethIng
too-some day. Not that It matters, really.
The old man's left me enough to last two
lIfetImes Funny how thIngs never Seem to
matter when one IS stmkmg nch. Say, why
not start a publIshIng house and get them
to prmt my stuff? Yeah, but what about the
cntlcs ? What about them? I'll buy them up
too, and then-happmess. Yeah, It's gotta
be I But why thiS uncommon deslfe to wnte ?
Some repressed chIldhood deSIre, perhaps.
Or the creatIve urge, y' know. Or... let's
leave It to the headshnnkers.
The scene sometlffie m the future. The
character-the same, except that he IS baldmg
and FAMOUS.
Happmess IS havmg your own publIshing
house, your very own. Also havmg your own
cntlcs who have damn near exhausted thetr
vocabularIes s11lgmg your praIses. Throw m
a coupla newspapers and some hIgh-brow
lIterary magazme to prmt their stuff And
there you have It-ParadIse. Adam never
had It so good, I tell ya.
Just hsten to this:
The Dally Prattler: He has to be read to
be belteved. FIrst-rate read mg.
The Punching Prmt: 'The Unhappy Ape' IS
the best book I have read In a long, long
tIme. WrItIng of thiS sort IS uncommon
these days. What clarIty of thought I What
a magnIficent turn for the apposite phrase I
And I shouldn't forget my fans. From all
over the world they come, these letters pralSmg my gemus, from adolescent teenage gIrls
and from no doubt adorable blue-stockmged
spmsters' What more can anyone want?
Move further along the geodeSIC and there
you sec him agam. Old (I Wish I could talk
of hIS grey, grey beard and of hIS lustrous
eyes, but the fact of the matter IS that he IS
bald and wears horn-rtmmed glasses) and
venerated as the Seer of hiS .<\ge.
The secret of my success? That's not for
me to say, actually. The creative urge, you
know. When the Muse comes upon you, out
paper and pen and Ink and there you are.
And there you are.
Moral Have you a rich Papa and a hanker~
ing for lIterary fame? Paper? pen and Illk?
Then, what the hell are you wattmg for?
Wnte, you IdlOt I

The extenSIon of lIbrary Wntngs IS another
favom that the resldLllts ought to be grateful
for. We would lIke to thank Mr. Nazlr
Ahmed and the Llblary Staff and hope that
they WIll contInue their good work.

PROBABILlTlf LIVES
Brams made numb
by the tyrant technology
Self-shutteled souls
strugglIng In Shadow
TheIr senses dimmed
their mUSIC muted
We evolve, growmg less ammal
but less human as well

â€¢
ActIOns which seem aImless
gather together day by day
To form a lIfe whIch must end
someday
its meaning stIli unknown
The random pattern repeats
for oneman and for all Man
We lead our Probabhty lIves
Each of us and all of us, a part
wIthm a whole.

THE SYSTEM

THE INTER-HOSTEL
ENTERTAINMENT
If you ever get around to wrtting 'The
DeciUle and Fall of lIT, Madras,' you could
do an enUre chapter on thIS annual gala.
I don't know what the three-day bmge IS
ID aid of. One very original thmker has claImed
that new talent finds IflSplratlon there, If
the mter-hostel affaIr IS any measure of IITlan
talents, It's tIme for sack-cloth and ashes. The
only thmg that It does IS force our SOCIal
secretanes mto some action and produce
an ultra-dull thirty-five mmutes of 'entertamment '. Every hostel finally ends WIth some
slckenmg skIt and even more slckenmg
'bhaua '. The (dea of creatIveness IS to put
up a TamIl-English skIt or hght a fire on
stage.

What exactly IS hoped to be gamed by this
colossal waste of time, money and energy
escapes me. The average IITlan Just sinks m
ennuI WIth a few mInutes of respite once III a
whIle when an mterestmg performer comes
and smgs the same song he has done at
Hostel Day, Gymkhana Inaugural etc.
Music, and that too only pop mUSIC, holds the
audIence. I thmk It IS time we scrapped
the Idea of an mter-hostel competitIOn and
we could have It on an IndIVIdual baSIS A
good Idea for lUrIng performers would be to
offer many pnzes In thIS way, only those
who are good wIll come forward and there
won't be any need to 'fill time' With mtndless trash.

Recently there was an attempt by some students of the Madras Umverslty to change the
system of educatIon there. Apparently their
pltght IS more pItiable than ours, but nevertheless, our system Isn't partIcularly popular.
The Whole course IS completely exam-onented
and the thIrd and the fourth years are enough
to get the most lllterested student fed up.
Seven hours a day of class IS absolutely too
much and an average fourth year has two
Jabs, three tutoflals and three peClodlcals
a week WorkIng every SIngle nIght up to
twelve absolutely kills any deSire for voluntary
learnlllg or domg somethIng on your own. A
person mterested III dOIng any deSIgn work or
developing a pet theory lack both time and
concentratIon. Campastlmes would lIke to
mVIte readers (both &taff and students) to
wrIte about how the system can be Improved
or made more digestible.
A few suggestIons, which you can CrItICIze,
are to have a fixed course for the first two years
and later, certam baslC subjects for every
semester, and a\[ other Subjects optIOnal. The
mmlmum and max mum number of credIt
pOInts per Slmester can be fixed and the
student can choose hIS own subjects. Another
suggestIOn would be to reduce the number of
worktng hours to five for the fourth and final
years to give more time for Independent work.
I am sure there WI\[ be a horde of new
s[lg~estlOns and If we get enough artIcles we
could have a scnous dlscusslOn page and get
someone to take notice. So, comc on, all
you onglnal thtnkers out there, get off your
blhmds and write I
DULEEP.
