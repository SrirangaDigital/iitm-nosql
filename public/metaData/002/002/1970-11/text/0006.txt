EDITORIAL
Th.e readmg pu.bltc has expressed the fear
tha.t all the page~ m this rag, mcludmg the
eclltotJal page, nught be turned mto .1 regular
grouses-and-gnevJnce~ affair. They are mortally afraid. Justly so. Three cheers for that.
Nothmg can be more heartemng to the
establishment than such a peace-lovlOg set of
undergraduates. It IS a privilege that has
been stripped off many a glorious In,tltutlOn
It must surely be grautYlllg to note that their
protest~ agam~t such a trend are moulded
In righteous mdlgnallon, but only a mild
attack ot the fever as such To repeat what
has been s3.ld before, to conVlnce ourselves of the
pUrity of thIS dlvmely-ordamed Armageddon,
we must say that they are Justified 'in, the
cucus IS crumbling '\Ith you, they say, It IS
gomg nght dO'\1l to hitherto untrodden depths
They are nght The pushers have mo\ed In
wheelmg and de.>.lmg a1\ the way, the naughty
hecklers have been given a majestic podIUm
from which to annoy the crowd; the deciders
of the IN and OUT things have muzzled In.
No wonder the pyramid IS falling onto the net.
No wonder. Now, to Sit back over your everso-nourlshlllg dmner, happy m the tummy
about haVIng knifed your way through one
more of the unpalatable Issues, safe WIth the
assurance that the unbreachable shan't be
breached, and that thiS poor, lIttle offiCial
mouthpiece of the eSlabhshment wJll be
doomed forever mto gettmg nothmg across.
There 15 an amusmg Side to this; a lot of
depressmg stuff gets WrItten In the name
of senou"ness. An unongmal translation of a
poem called 'Apollt1cal Intellectuals' and
another treatise on ' Culture and Commles-m
lIT' are suffiCiently temptmg to make one
overdo one's part But then, no one wants
thiS to read hke an Ayn Rand Stalin debate.
The moral of the story IS sImply thiS

Board cannot surVive Just by employmg the
standard ethiCS of Journalism So It IS back
to the wheeler-dealers, the unmentionables,
the EdltonaI Board.

Therl' are opinions and oplmons on what
Campasllmes should and should not prmt
Parts of what IS pnnted 1<; Ignored, other parts
sneered at, and the rest objected to vehemently.
Anyway, what one IS mterested 111 IS the
obJcctlve auns of these objectIOnable passages
and whether they have been achieved. For
lIlstance, the General Secretary '69-70, was
of the Opinion that the election system
needed a thorougll once-over and 1118 report
was publIshed III thiS Journal. He wa~. With due
apologies to everyone who might dl~agree,
a swell guy: he knew what he was talkmg
about and Ius opmlons were well worth
exammlllg. But then, they ""cren't. Little or
no notiC<- was takcn of thIS pomt In the r~port,
probJbly becau~c apathy IS the E,tabhshment's
bag also, or because the general public could
not attach any ultenor motive to thiS, for he
wa~ push1l1g off In a short while, anyway.
Why, then, thiS mdlgnatlOn on what amounts
to a reiteratIOn of an ollce-legltlmate demand?
It all balls down to thiS
It doesn't pay
to dismiSS anything that IS said as a personal
affront to the guyq who bave made It

exactly where we left off-the lengthy

There have been many misinterpretations
of the last edllotlaj
some are senous,
some, not so-but aU of them
are

The editOrial called for clear
thinking m the field of staff-student relatlonshrp and trred to examlOe, to a certam extent,

both ThiS Can be easdy seen from the article,
and Interested gentlemen can read the whole
of the said arttcle and pat tbemselves on the
back-If the need anses, that IS.
What was referred to was the way III which
a teacher handles hiS class-not academically,
but otherWise. That he never came second
nght from hiS schooldays to his graduate
study III the States IS as irrelevant to the
context as the mformatlon that he used to

understand that 1t cannot fill the VOid created
by lack of rational, sane and sympathetiC
approach, no, It cannot q\llte gIVe that somethmg which IS lacking In an average teacher
here. To see some sense in that, one has
to beheve In the Importance of mamtammg a
few fundamental standards rn Inter-human

But as long as everyonc IS
distracted by that great IlTlan credo-Umverslty first-rankers teachmg the Cream of India
make up all InstItute of Natronal Importance,
and that's all that matters-these standards
have to be dispensed With.
Fmally, when an Assistant Professor stands
up III class and says, 'I'm a compulSive
reader, I read even CampaS!lmes,' and goe>
on to say, 'Don't comt' to people lIke us
for recomml'ndatlons,' It IS so childish that It
causes a Quc:a'lne S In the stomach. To try and
change such attitudes would he too hard on
our bleedmg hearts whIch have borne many
a bruIse In the past. We all rehsh a hint of
self-pity, mock or no, but to say that the
gencralIty of the article hurt the commumty
In general IS carrymg that relIsh too far.
One would expect people to be more ratIonal
about gettIng their feelmgs hurt, and, of
course, about what they say \U class, lest they
should prove our POlOt.

SICK ONES
Happiness IS' Loolung at your watch durmg
a lecture and findrng that 5 mmutes are left
Misery IS
a ~ubstltute lecturer, a bungled
penodlcal, a hard-working tutor.
Ecstasy IS an hour off, a power failure on
Friday night.
Heaven IS: the day off, the death of a
preSident, an earthquake.
Hell IS
Monday through Saturday.
Agony IS: A phYSICS lecture after a lousy
lunch.
Hope IS: An epidemiC of laryngitIs among
the lecturers, an entrance exam restncted to
gIrls.
Sex is
Unnecessary, a back row.
The End
IS here.
