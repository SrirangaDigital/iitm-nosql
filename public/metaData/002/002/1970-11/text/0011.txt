Walk mto Saraswathl Hostel at about
o'clock 011 .i holiday mornmg, and you will
find a rather heavy mass of human flesh dressed
III a red lungl, a tenms baman that was once
white, and a pair of mod sltppers ImprovIsed
from corduroy shoes, \\alkmg down to the
mess for breakfast. Well, readers, the creature
IS popularly kno\"n as Parama, but the lecturers
and the hke call hIm P. Parameshwaran.
Metallurgy IS hiS bag, and fortunately or unfortunately, he IS the Fme ,Arts Secretary of
the InstItute Gymkhana. My vIctory IS a
resu It of hard \\ ork and determInatIon,' claImed
the yOWlg lad after hIS success at the polls.
QUIte truly, Parama's enthUSIasm and determination know no bounds. He has been trymg for thIS post for the past three years and
every year It was the same story-' My fnends
dItched me, )arl' Ne\ertheless, he worked
for the FIne Arts CommIttee for the past two
years, and the vaunts of hIS rIch expenence In
t he field have paId off.

Dlgressmg from the bonng and unpleasant
topic of electIons and local pohtIcs, let u~ see
the vatlOUS other aspects of our well-esteemed
f nend and the chIef SIdekick of the Gymkhana.
Parama exhIbIts a profound Interest In games,
especially basketball. The whole of last year
he was III charge of the basketball (no less).
He used to carry It to the field everyday at
four ID the evenIng and brmg It back at seven.
Probably carrymg the ball as punctIlIously as
he did and rolling on the court a few tImes a
day got hIm familIar With the court and now
he claims to be one of the InstItute players.
Parama IS fond of playmg bndge. He hkes
to play hIS own game oblivIOUS of hi' partner's
presence Let me tell you that bemg hIS
partner IS somewhat !Ike havmg a CrIck In the
neck. 'Shut up, you clod. I know how to
play,' IS what one hears when hiS game IS diSapproved, no matter With what propnety one
talks 'FantastIc I you have made an overtnck,'
remarked hiS jubilant partner once, • By the
way, Parama, blddmg four spades does not
mean makmg four tricks.' On heanng thIS,
the whole room, klbbltzers and all, burst Into
laughter and the accused turned red In the face
and walked out of the room for good-' Good
nddance to rubbish r'
Commg to the rather touchy subject of
sophistIcatIon, Parama IS no less backward
than you or me He smokes lIke a chImney
and pants lIke a racehorse. 'Got a fag on
you, yar,' IS the way one IS accosted on thiS
campus. Parama who spends hiS money and
other people's money as well rather profusely
on fags complams that the cream of the society
that I1Tlans are, does not know how to accost

people He hImself brheves that If you ask a
person for a favour It should be somethmg
worthwhIle and apprecIable. Well, I've already mentIoned one IlIstance of thiS belIef of
hiS and If I \\ere to relate the others there
would be no space left for me to complete
thIS artIcle.
Parama preaches narCISSism. He feels that
he IS the most h,mdsome man on thIS campus
WJth an umque reddIsh compleXIon and a very
symmetrical body. For those of you who
have seen him, thIS mIght seem to be a paradOXical statement. He IS symmetrrcal, but the
runs of symmetry IS Just twIsted through an
angle of mnety degrees. With thIS figure that
he boasts of, Parama IS OptimiStiC of gettmg
any glrl-fnend or ma chene amQur or whatever you call It. But he just doesn't want
to any more. He loafs around WIth some
dame he calls hiS fiancee and some others
whom he calls hIS fiancee's fflends. GOIng
from appreCIatIOn of beauty to beauty of
thought, I'd lIke to remark that Parama
seems to Impress old people too. It ~eems
thIS 'ere pnnclpal of certam college was
reluctant to send her gIrls to a functIOn on
our campus what WIth elect.flclty breakdowns
bellIg tlmely and all that. It was then that
the honour of lIT was upheld by young
Parama. 'ElectrICIty breakdowns? Unthinkablel We are haVIng our function between
14-00 hrs. ann [8-00 hrs.
So the questIon
of darkness prevallmg doesn't anse, see?'
The prmclpal nodded, gave hIm a SIck grIn
and said, 'You seem to have a lot of faith
m your mtegnty. You appeal to me as a
very promlsmg youngster' The word promISIng stdl puzzles me, as I do not know
whether she was beIng IroUical or Just understandIng.
All of us undergraduates have done our
tIme of two years amIdst the stInkmg derivatIVes of benzenc and so forth. But have
you come across a pOIgnant smell that IS
posItIVely nauseatmg' If you haven't, then
come to Parama's room. There have been
se\leral theOries regarding thIS strange smell,
but one popular theory whIch has outlasted
the rest explaInS It as bemg due to a complex reactIOn between the mud In hIS sports
outfit, rotting clothes and cIgarette ash Ul the
presence of semI-darkness. He has IIvcd in
that den for four years now and has secured
a faIrly high a\-erage In hIS studIes. But of
course, lIke everyone else, he is waltmg
for a propitIOUS moment to get out of this
quagmIre.

R.

JAGANNATHAN.

A couple of months back, two remarkable
and seemmgly unconnected events were
reported In the newspapers. Both concerned
the Madras Umverslty. The first, a ladies'
college, whose students are known for theIr
'mtellectual competence and ;esthetIC modernIty " organised a fancy fete to coUect money
for some cause. Then attempt to swmg to
the tune of the 70'S, to say the least, was no,
entIrely successful. The grand fete witnessed
a power faIlure which lasted nearly an hour
and m the words of a leadIng newspaper of
the CIty, whose understatements make The
Tmzes read IIkc a shocker, several ladles had
theIr clothes damaged and experIenced much
dIscomfort. It was to most of them, ObVIously, a fete worse than death. The second
the finals of a bIg football tournament In the
Madras UmverSlty was played at dawn m the
AIr-Force football field outSIde the City lImIts
and the students m that area numbered
twenty-two. The earher finals had been
abandoned because the crowd had become,
accordwg to the same newspaper, unmanageable and had mdulged In hoollgamsm. To
many these may seem ramdrops m thc desert,
as much related to each other as chalk IS to
cheese The purpose of th's analysIS IS to
brIng out the cloud that produces such ram,
and, If pOSSIble, to show that thiS IS no ' gentle
ram from heaven' of PortIa's lIDagmatlon but
somethmg putrId.
To brIng out the real ImplIcations of these
• trIvIalItIes', let me portray at some length
the behavIOur of the characters who make up
thIS structure or It would be nearer the mark
If I saId, the puppets that mar thiS palavar
called an Indian UnIVerSity of which the one
at Madras IS a good example. Havmg spent
four dlummating years at the Madras UnIverSity, takIng part In almost alllt~ actiVItIes, I
feel competent enough to dISCUSS It.
The first of these characters I Will caUWith apologies to Thurber's Walter MlttyKrIShnan Kutty. He IS the first because he
represents the largest number and IS consequently the least mterestmg Knshnan
Kutty's day In the lIfe begms With the bus
fIde from hIS home to the college. The
distance IS only a mlie but he prefers to take
the bus that passes through a few ladies'
colkges; lest you should thmk that the falIer
sex IS hiS cuppa cha, le[ me beat you to the
draw; nothIng can be farther from the truth.
The greatest emotion III KK's make-up IS
frustration. He IS no Clark Gable and hIS
knowledge of the snobbery that goes for
SOphIStiCatiOn among us these days can be
wntten on the back of a postage stamp With
space left for glue. HIS only aIm 10 taking
thIS nde IS to' have sIght'-a cant phrase
whose populanty In the Madras Umverslty IS
about equal to the' sldee' here. This bus
ride of hIS could be an educatIOn to rum ~
the complammg bourg eo ISle, the hurrymg
arIstocracy, the Imploring proletariat. But
hIS frustratIOn, hiS medIOcrity make hIm seek
more dIgeStible grass. HIS eyes fall on posters
InvItIng the multltude to see, hear and mdulge
in obscemty.
HIS time m college does nothing to lessen
hIS frustratIOn or remove hIS medIOCrIty.
These colleges, temples of learmng all, kdl
all the orlgmaltty that mIght have Ifltruded
IOta theIr perfect ltfeIessness. KK has
enough fnends, however, to make hlffi oblIViOUS of hIS plIght. In fact, If these fnends
were not there he would not go to college at
all. HIS day crowds to a close, those buds
Without a feather creepmg together. Krishnan
Kutty sleeps the sleep of a perennIal nlghtshow man, hiS frustratIOn appeased to a certam
extent as he sees the hero deftly handle the
bu.Jgmg heroine; hiS medIOCrIty resonatmg to
the medIOCrIty of the productIons of the IndIan
Film Industry.
Slightly different from Knshnan Kutty IS
hIS rIcher counterpart, Praveen Gupta. ThiS
youth shares KK's medlocnty but not
his bus nde. He IS also frustrated because
hiS 'deep knowledge' of western culturethat IS about the only thing he has deep
