To Prasad and His Two-Wheeled Pushcart

A PLEA FOR mE CONSERVATION
AND Bf.TfER USE OF UTIAN
HEROISM
Gentlemen with certam extra curncular
ha,c an unhlpPY !..nact.. of fallmg
foul of Pllbhc opinIon and their grades
There arc acm [tle~ mId actl'ltles, and some
of them ate too goddamn mterestmg for the
mental peace of e'cn the least hidebound
IITlan

acttvltl~S

Granted that heroes WIll be heroes and thlt
the egOist rull 5\\anl.. around but thtngs
can relLh unman~geable proportIons when
S\\anklng around becomes competItive The
specutor... "\Ugh the Introverts snIgger In
their sleeves and thc more ell.trov~rt nonheroes e"press their opInion In Just so many
'''ords, generally behind the hero ~ back
But the hero, poor devil, knows not how
he measures up tn the pubhc regard, and
even If he does have '1 vague Idea, because
he's the t\ pc of mdlVldual he IS, he convinces
hunself that he doesn't care a damn for the
opmlOns of the great unwashed multItude
That's the hallmark of the hero he doesn't
gl're a damn But he doesn t give a damn In
a very o>tenlatlous way, because he crave~ to
be unlque, he craves for recognll10n He
wants notortety and almost unfailIngly collects
an mterestmg aura
But thmk, ye folks, one moment It IS thIS
hero wbo \\111 come to the fore whe'l the
tmle for testmg comes and men are thrown
on their mdl\ldualtty The plalll fact IS
that the hero rates hImself pretty high,
perhaps unfoundedly trusts to hIS ablhtles a
lot more and generally takes the tnlttatlve
111 a moment of stress
The hero IS contrary
enough to thlnt.. for himself And because of
hiS strong motnatlon [or self-expressIOn. he
IS a tnfle more artlsllC and creatl\e than the
herd
So the de\ II may Cllre fellows )OU see
klckmg round the landscape are the ones
capable of dOl1lg somethmg If they'd only
stop swankmg around and get down to
busmess
Groan, but It'~ true Corner a
hero type, shnnk hIS head, do a httle bit of
expenmentlng on hao psychologv, and you 1l
see the mechamsms that make hIm tick
Very mterestmg, I assure you
It IS a pity that WIth such quanttties of
Indl\lduahty floatmg around we should let It
detenorate mto So much stupId swank In
an institute of such (oft cIted) nat10nal
Importance, shouldn t Voe make better use of
our hero matenal) There s a Jot of It, and
no ml~takang that Give th~ hero something
to smk hiS teeth \filO give him a challcngtng
task worthy of hiS colossal ego and you have
a harmless u~cful thankwg IITlan, a rare
commodity Mavbe thmgs would get done,
maybe our achle'rements wouldn't be Itmlted
to the dlmtnsJOns of words and more words
If WI. trusted tn the IIT13n hero

(When William Blkcsworth decided to
comp1re Pra<;nd <; bike WIth Navzer's bike.
hL pnt down \\1'" opInions m v,,"r'lc Prasld
felt he ought to dlffu The result was the
follo\\ mg lllteriude )
T\\o Ja\\.1s 'UL there, one IS of thl. good
Eighteenth century stuff that's hewtd out of
\\ood
If you try and start It, It Will Just wheeze
And run m the gLner'l.l dlreclton of the
bfLtZC
Sllrpnsmgly It runs hour after hour
It must be because of hl~ wIll power
One fine day Its god-given sp,.n \\111 lapse
And the "hole damn bIke Will Just collapse
Dav and nIght you watch out for a loose
damp
In ramy '>eason your ,eat Will become damp
FIt only for scrap after crushmg In a VIce
Too bad the slupptng cost IS more than Its
pnce
And the other bike IS a str<:ak of llghtnmg,
At start Its deafenmg roar IS fnghtcmng,
Behold and listen to ItS low rumble
'Yluch III It'> shed makes the other one
tremble

Open hCI up and you see speed,
Sorta speed III Madras YOII never need.
Flr~t or top you see It p\lU
Wllhout 1 l>olttary seconds lull
(On rcadmg thiS, Prasad had to try hiS hand
at verse A deSCriptIOn of hiS effort IS
Sklppld due to obvIOUS reasons)
Just you walt, you Silly )oung sods
In Ju'>t a week she'll be chrome and brass
PraIse her then, you yakkety bards
And God help the poor guy who dares make
a pass
[ThiS was the repartee]
Change pIston, crash-guard. clutch and the
lake
YOII mIght as well try to change your bike
Plaster It With brass and chrome
And keep It 10 your drawmg room
All chrome and brass won't make It start
KICk It hard and It'll come apart
In a month or so, It Won t even run
When you sell It for Junk, we'll watch the
fun.
(At thIS pomt the Interlude was brought to
a rather sudden end as the lecturer deCIded
to walk towards the last bench)
