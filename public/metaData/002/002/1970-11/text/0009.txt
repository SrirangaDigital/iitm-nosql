'THE DRAMA IS A LEAFLET '-BERT
BRECHT AND AFTER
FrIedrich Nletlsche's statement 'God IS
dead' was published In 1883 The number
of Europeans who subscribe to thiS OpInion
has been steadily merta'lOg, to say the least.
The theatre of the absurd IS one exponent of
dus feelmg
It dramallll'S the tXlslence
which Il> left alone \'Iuhout a metJph)slcal
centre, It duphcat(s on the ~tage the lXlstence
of man as a strangLr m IllS own surroundlllgs.
The authors of the ab~\Jrd are bemg declared
as belongmg to the bourgeo's theatle of fun
and gamts by those who abo believe that God
IS dead, but who have found a new system
and a new meanm{!, and new \ 1lms the left

The theatre of the Middle Ag{~ "as feudal.
Man's relatlQnshlp to God refllcted accurat~ly

theatre started bemg bourgeoll> With the
RenaIssance. The CItizen began to see himself
as the most Important tIling m the \\orld.
ThiS was, of course, a b)-ploduct of the

people try hard to make the theatre proletarl3n
From the inCongruities, inJustices, calamities,

Bert Brecht's • Drelgroschenoper '-takmg
up John Gay's' Beggar's Opera' from 17 28 had Its premiere In Berhn, 1928. Apart from
adding the Mackle-Messer-song about sharks
and so to the store of evergreens, It contended
and claimed that Citizens are robbers m
disguIse. Bankers are thieves, pO\1eemen
are sentImental cnmmals thugs are citizens.
The Ber1:n CItIzens from theIr expensIve
seats cried theIr' Jolly Good Show' and
gave to all subsequent Left wnters the
eternal gooseflesh

Fnednch Schiller (17S9-1806) m hiS younger
days was truly a revolutionary. ForcefulJy
mterned III the Swablan duke's school ot the
regional elite, he \HO-e hiS play' Dlc Rauber'
(The Robbers), at the age of 18. Thb, and
the followmg play of hiS, were forbidden
Schiller fled to anoth. r of the German
states and had It performed
The 19th
century made him
an
object of national pnde (because of hiS
hIstOrical frescoes lIke • Wallen,tem' or
• Mana Stuart', becausc he was a fflend of
sorts of J. W. Goethe, In spl>e of hiS plays
bemg thoroughly anI! monarLhlc and republican), even more so when Germany became an
EmpIre agam III 1871
In school we spent two or three years on
him No drama survives that. Today he IS
a dassll:
Schiller proClaimed that the theatre should
be THE educatIOnal mstltutlon of the nation
SlIghtly modifying hiS demand, many playWrights of our days wan' the same thmg
dldacllc theatre

.

I thmk one can say It all really started with
Ben Brecht
Ills concept of the EPIC
THEATRE was eye opemng, trall-blazmg
and tradltlOn-foundmg
The sCientific approach, Brecht said, of
which nature already IS the object, shall be
applied to man and mterhuman relations, too
For the stage to do so a new type of drama
and of staging IS necessary. In 1931 Brecht
s,ated for the first time some of the
differences.

DramatIc Form of Theatre
The stage' embodIes' a process
Involves the spectator
consumes hiS activity
makes emotIOns pOSSible

Br<..cht wanted to abandon the magic of the
thcatre, which makes the spectator Identify

staged play an md< pendent world of Its own.

a proletalldn form of theatre to the worker/

the fringe of Tubmgen. It's a warm ",ummer
day, the \\orkers scatter on the grassy hillocks
outSide the gates LO AND BEHOLD, a
truck draw~ near, the Side boards are lowered
down, some students use the loadmg plane as
a stage and start to act. One of them Impersonates the explOIted non-skilled worker, another the exploltll1g employer, a third, the
greedy warmonger and dealer In arms, etc
The men from the factory, though feelmg

THEATRE It lI~es deVIces of the popular
theatre hke puppets, types Instead of characters,
vernacular lrstcad of stage language. The
pedagogIcal output h unknown, and sometimes
the addressees don't like It
Apart from the content It IS certam that m
thIS type of theatre no resthetle renewals are

the Happening and the theatre of the absurd,
IS purely sOCial. At least m ItS mtentlons.

THE AESTHETICS OF TRANSFORMA·
TION: HAPPENINGS
In Berltn, during hiS trial for some mmor
offence, the young m1n refused to stand up
when the Judge a~ked hIm a questIOn. Fmally
he complied, sa) mg 'If It furthers the findmg
of th e truth l'
Dltrlng a "'ymposlUm of renowned philologIsts Ifl the US, a nude gul was let down to
the floor from the gallery; once m the hall,
she started sellIng sweets and cool drmks.
In Tubmgen, the Students' Theatre Group
mVlted people to an evenmg of modern theatre
and took the usual fee from each spectator.
What the audience then beheld on the stage
were students drmkmg beer. students drawmg nalVe httle sketches, a student's small
daughter playmg ball; what they could
hear over thl" system were: theoretiw

cal discourses on the nature of modern
theatre, addresses a~kmg the public to Jom
the fUll, compldmts about the unlnventIVenesS
of thc audIence etc After nearly two hours
some (student) spectators became so frustrated,
msecured and lnfunated that they clambered
on to the ~tagl! and destroyed an old run-down
plano. Tools hke saws and hammers had
bel n supplied.

.

.

All these happenmgs are usually called
Happel1lngs. What are they, and what are
they for?
HappenIngs belong to the dldactLc theatre.
They arc aCtions, whIch occur m a surroundIng which so far had seemed unfit for these
actions. The nude amongst th'! phl101oglsts
seems somehow unreal All Happenmgs seem
somehow unreal, because they occur Without
any outward motivation, a8 Isolated mtermeZZ1, 111 a context of accepted realtty. Thus
they render their surroundlllgs also somewhat
unreal Reality becomes distant, slightly
e,tranged, and thereby a pJsslble object of
analysl!. The nude, as she IS absurd among
the phtlologlsts, makes, for one fleetmg
moment, the phIlologists absurd.
The yuung man In the court foam was
didactiC 111 .1 more precise meaning. He
showed and said that the humlhatmg gestures
of JUTlSdlCtlOn are only hoUow moulds, the
contents of which are not related to the contents
of JUflsdlC!lOn as a soc!:l mbtltutlo~
The students who durmg a demonstratIOn
smear themselves With red colour and play
death by bullets, the girls who durll1g a
lecture by neo-Marxlan, Th. W. Adorno,
enter the daiS and bare their breasts; the
theatre-goers, who are asked to enter a bus,
are shipped to some remote place In the
countrYSide and are left there: they are sub~
Jects and objects of Happenmgs.
Happenwgs are actIOns of the powerless.
They are essentially or ;;esthetical nature.
They are make-beheve and as-If. They are
substitutes for factual oppOSItion. They
TRANSFORM the world mto a theatre and
show the ludicrousness of the actors. They
reveal the histriOnic nature of human behaViour m mstltutlOns They reveal the
mechamcal reproductIOn of patterns by those
who happen to play the respective (SOCial)
role. They reveal that roles are roles. They
are destructive only where taboos and accepted
values are concerned.
AND they proVide those who usually are
acted on With the sensatIOn of acting themselves.
In thc example of Tftbmgen's promlsmg
youth, now the mstltutlon which was rendered
absurd was the theatre. Thus: Happemngs
can be anti-theatre.

EPILOGUE-OR: OF COURSE TIDS WAS
ONLY A MODEST ATTEMPT
The rest IS not Silence at all. There are
lots of writers and stage-directors, who do not
fit wto the given categories. It I~, of course,
beyond my htrlltS, but let me casually drop
two or three names.
There IS Ratner W. F<l,8bender, who turns
out plays and films exceedmgly fast, say one
every t\'o months He IS concerned, like
many othcrs, With the contents analYSIS of
everyday behaVIOur In his' Katzelmacher '
he presents an Itahan worker 111 a German
VIllage, whom hiS colleagues and neighbours
treat as an outcast on no other grounds than
hIS otherness 1I11mgUlstic and' racial' respect.
Fa,Bbender mvestlgates the very patterns of
thlllkmg and assessmg, accepted and promoted
through centunes. which mduce men to act
as they do Inhumanely.
There IS MartlO Sperr. • The Huntlllg
Scenes of Lywer Bavana' tell the story of
a dllrgent and effiCient mechamc, a homosexual, who, on returmng from town work to
hIS home Village, IS treated as the evIl \fiw
carnate. Martm Sperr presents lucidly the
JuxtapOSItIon of ChristJan festIval and cruelty,
of honourable speeches and hemous behavIOur,
of profeSSion of tolerance and ruthless persecutIOn of the sexually different The play
ends With the magmficent and shattering
scene of the outcast hldmg In the woods and
be1l1g searched for by apparently bloodthIrsty
boy-scouts, policemen and Villagers.
