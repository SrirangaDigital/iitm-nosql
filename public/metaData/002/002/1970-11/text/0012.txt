The Pope made a pact With Hitler m order
to safeguard the German CatholIcs, he did
not care much for the Jews; III fact, he
neglected their eVil fate sadly. A young priest
suffers from the church's Indifference to what
happens to non-NaZIS III Germany and gcts a
transfer to a concentration camp There he
witnessed the bankruptcy of OCCidental (here:
German) humamtanamsm.
Thus III Rolf Hochhuth's ' Dcr Stellvertreter' (,The RepresentatIVe'). Theatre of DOCUMENTATION, the pages of history reread on the stage. In the same vem Peter
Weiss's 'Die Ermlttlung' ('The Tflal of Nuremberg') and 'Der Lusltamsche Popan.tl ' (about
Portuguese cruel colomahsm In East Afnca),
Hochhuth's 'Ole Soldaten' ('The Soldiers' .
Did Churchill have the Polish general assaSSInated for tactIcal reasons ?), and qUite a few
more. Commitment and aCUity, punctiliousness and concern.

Our Prospects

or
(How to Win the Meet
Without Really Trying-Ed.)
The Seventh Inter-lIT Meet IS drawmg
near. Preparations are bemg made, committees are bemg formed and the excitement IS
slowly buddmg up.
The last Inter-lIT Meet m Madras was
supposed to be the best ull now. Our
endeavour IS to make tlus Meet the best for
years to come. With Prof. Gupta and Dr.
Anantaraman backmg us up, I feel thiS Meet
IS gomg to be qUite a memorable one.
What Will the Meet have m store for us ?
ThiS IS a millIon-dollar question 1 Will we
retam our posItion? or go lugher? or
Will we be pushed back? There IS suIl the
feelmg that we don't have a dog's chance of
commg first. After commg last for so many
years (our second positIOn last year was diSmISSed as a' fluke '), guys just can't belIeve
we can come first.
I personally feel, thiS year, we have a very
reasonable chance of making It to the top.
We are the hosts and that means no change of
.enVironment for us. ThiS has numerous
-advantages. To mention a few, we Will not
be suffering from fatIgue due to travel, the
food IS what we are used to, the grounds are
the same old ones m whIch we have practised
for years, and the most Important of all will
be the backing of the home crowd.
Over and above thiS, we were very fortunate to have most of the draws for the InterlIT Meet III our favour. In a few games we
can saIl smoothly Illto the tina Is. I would
lIke to mentIOn here briefly how the vauous
teams are shapmg for the coming Meet.
The Shuttle and Tenms teams, as everyone
knows, are III top form. In tennIS With the
formidable trIO of Lionel Paul, Ram Kumar
Menon and Laksljmmarayan, I don't thmk
the other IITs have a hope'
In Shuttle, EddIe hasn't been III form lately.
He could not complete a hat-trick by wmnmg
the State ChampIOnship agam Even though
he 18 off form, he stIlI reigns supreme among
the IITs What With Valdy backmg hIID up, the
-other IlTs Will be fightmg for a second place.
In Basketball, Mr. PhillIp says, , The team IS
.domg very well' In spite uf ram or periodicals, one can see the basketball team practlsmg
hard. We Will have pretty otlff OppOSitIOn
from Kanpur In the semi-finals but Palam says
It IS the finals that wlll be the toughest
hurdle.

The Hockey team IS a very balanced team
this year. Co-ordmatlOn among the forwards
IS lacking but both Mr. Joga Rao and
Muthanna feel that With a httle more practlce,
we will be a force to reckon With in the finals.
The Football team is as strong as ever, says
Mr. K. U N. Rao. Unfortunately they have
to meet the champs, Kharagpur, In the semi's
No team IS InvIncible, says Shorty, the captam, and we aim to prove It by gIVIng KGP
the surprtse of their lIves'
The Volleyball team, a httle weak In the
begmmng, has regained Its old vigour
Mr. RangaraJan, a former State player, IS
coachmg It sometimes even 111 the mornmgs A mlmmum of second place IS assured.
Table-tennIS-flot a hope, IS the general
comment-we, the team, are gOing to prove It
otherWise Mr. Murugesh IS coming to coach
us soon Watch out for the outsiders-us' ,
Athletics :-It IS heartenmg to note that
we aren't as bad as we thought. ThiS IS all
due to Mr. A. B. Knshnaswamy, the athletics
coach. We owe a lot to hIm. Once he
arrives at the stadIUm, he IS all actIOn. One
mstant he IS coachmg the trIple Jumpers; the
next. the sprinters, then a tiP to the polevaulters, a nod to the high Jumpers-man, he
sure IS a bee-hive of activity. With hIS lively
anecdotes, he holds even the spectators' attention It IS only due to hun that our morale
III athletlcs has risen from rock bottom to a
very high level.
Somethtng about the athletes now •
Narendra IS dOlOg well as usual 1U all hiS
events, I e., pvelm, hurdles, tnple jwnp, high
Jump and long jump He started pole vault
lately, and belIeve It or not, he cleared S1' III
hiS first Jump' Babu GIreesh IS dOing 9' I 1 " a wmnmg height in pole vault these days.
Narendra did 41' III triple Jump whIle
DaVid Roby, Fldd and Chanchary did 40
The coach was very Impressed With DaVid. He
s trammg him for the throws and the Jumps.
Fldd, Skew, Kamath, Bhaskar and Victor
are all practlsmg hard tn the runs. We hope
to \\ In relays due the coach's new system of
baton-changmg The coach feels that With a
httle more practICe our athletes wIll do well
In the Meet
With luck we can make It to
second place m athletics
Gymnastics :-Arun Bhen, the captam, says
the team IS Improvmg every day The coach,
Mr IsmaIl IS commg five tlme~ a week. He
feels the team Will be very good by the time of
the Inter-liT Meet In Gymnastics, one has
learnt from past expenences, never to foretell
the results. We hope to be among the first
three .
In the final analYSIS, we have a fightmg
l,hance of gettmg to thl, top. It all bods down
to thls~hard practlce dUring the last lap
before the Meet.
ThiS year 'We arc haVIng as long a camp as

And there IS, agam, Peter Handke With hiS
play 'Kaspar'. The problem IS that of
language and what It does to man.
The hero Kaspar can only be himself, that
IS hiS own, as long as he has no language. As
soon as words and sentences are Imposed on
him, with them he meVitably adopts certam
patterns of understandmg, reactmg and thmkIng. As he cannot Control the powers that
shape language, he IS not able to have a free,
own Will. The deCISions he makes are made
by the language which he uses to verbalIze
them, the steps he takes are dictated by the
language, In which he thinks of hiS WIsh to
take thiS step, he IS an object of language
rather than Its subject.
As reahty becomes real for the perception
the very moment It IS NAMED, the patterns
of percelvmg realIty are dIctated by the
language which prOVides the names, that IS to
say, by the powers (socIal enVironment,
tradition, milieu, upbrIngIng) which prOVide
the language. ThiS means also that Kaspar
cannot commumcate those thmgs whIch he
perceives OUTSIDE the handed-down
lingUIstic patterns. Each man IS an Isolated
bemg Incapable of conveYing any perception
other than the obJectlvlzed perceptIOns enshrined in language.
Thus Kaspar's speech is the outer world of
the lOner world of hiS thoughts; but the
orgamsatlOn of thiS outer world IS not under
hiS control; the outer world of speech as given
from without has an mner world of Its own,
different from the Inner world of Kaspar.
As on the other hand, Kaspar of C)UfSe is
a tiny part of the powers who shape language,
we have a truly dIalectical relationship.
Language. being a SOCial act, at the same
tnne confines the subject to ItS subjectIVity
AND changes the objectIve language essentially alIen to hIm, which mfluences agam the
subject. Pretty.

Handke's approach IS closely related to the
sentenCe that a sentence can only be proved
or disproved by another sentence and has
no essentIal connectIOn With reality. This
then pertams to the controversy between
Neo-Poslllvists and Neo-Marxlsts, which
agam-but here IS the point, where I, exhausted and helpless, throw the towel and
my arms up In despair. So lemme go
pOSSible There IS always somethmg or the
other croppmg up dUring the semester which
curtails regular practice
A 3o-day camp IS
just what we reqUIre to bUIld each team to lis
peak Hard and sIncere practice during thiS
penod, I am sure, Will lead us to victory Let
us show them what we can do.
Come along, guys-let's pull up our socks
and fight'
In conclusIOn, I would lIke to mention that
the sliccess of the Meet Will depend on the
co operatIOn of the students I hope both
the staft' and the students Will come fOf\~ard
and help make the Seventh Inter-lIT Meet a
big sllccess.
