OF THINGS ....
EollS, so It would seem, ha\ e sped by
Since these gentlemen, who nowadays attest
their flou.rlshmg <Ignatures to the pompous
notices that chitter our boards, .currttd
around the hostel. frantically seeking \otes.
Promises \\ere thrown left and nght---one
gulped them and eIther S1\al101\cd them or
managed a feeble \\ltUCI~m. 1 he Spltlt was
that of the soaring s( ventle"-\ ole me In and
I'll .....-but then ill thiS fast movmg era It
so, so easy to be taken for a nde.
It must In all fairness be admitted that
qUlte a bit ot thiS enthusiasm has transformed
Itself Into Just a little actIon before predictably
petermg out. Clubs galore h;1.\e been '>tarted
and \\hlle one IS not qu.lte In a pOSItion to
CQmment on their functlOnmg or as to
whether they are functlonmg at all, one IS lcd,
at least by mdlcatlons on the notlce·bo'lrd, to
beheve that the IlTlan I~ at long mercifully
last turnmg hIS thOlights to fields Othl r than
the Saturday mo\ Ie and the soponfic Sunday
ahead. In fact, If the number of clubs noW
graCing the campus scene wah lhelr posters
and announcements, IS any Justlfiable lIldlcalIon at all,.of the enthUSiasm that IS gOing mto
tnem, then \\e \\ill really hale somethmg to
shoot our mouths off about, "hen our eagerly
awaited guests pile 10
Which brings one rather me\ ltably to the
Inter-IIT Meet
So much has alreadv
been said of thiS opportulllty-of-a-lifeumebmashmg-success-to-be, but to the casual
observer, precIOus little seems to be bemg done
about It. The s\admm Contl1\U\!S to remam in
Its cunously pathetic state of dllapldatlonone always had the feeling that an overenthUSIastic cncl.et match between two overenthusiastiC hostels-and there are qutte a few
of that category around-would suffice to
brmg the whole thmg do\\n about one's ears.
We have been loful) Informed by more than
one sports secretary that now or never, Will we
have to make that desperate-maybe lasteffort to head the five but doubts-ho\\e"er
dtslo\al---contmue to hnger. In fact those
specunens who have the rather .J.ubll)U$ pO ... Ilege of donnmg the Institute colours have
been mformed that the trauung camp will eXtend for one whole month and that they wlll
ha'lle the pleasure-a tnRe ramy, maybC-{)f
bemg the Institute's guests for the whole
v-acatlon.

Passmg by another of those structures that
seem to crop up aU over 'tnese syhan surrOWldmgs '-this tIme near the HSB---one
sees a cunollS sectton of a wall WIth a stretch
of concrete before It. One IS mformed
casually that this has been provIded for wall
teoms practice \Vby then, may one ask, has
not the basketball court been cemented?
Certamly, our players have performed creditably enough III the past few years to warrant a
feW-Just a fev., mmd you-amelUtles. But,
no ' The offiCial at the tenms courts tells us
that It IS not WlUun hiS provmce. ThiS
apologeuc, and 10 the Circumstances, excusable excuse only serves to rughlight the deplorable lack of co-ordmatJon 10 the Gymkhana.
And thus, one has to stand by and watch the
basketball team kIck up dust With every frantic
mo\ement, whde nearby, a slab of concrete
gazes serenely at the sky, never, ill all probabill!), to be trod on.
There was one very mterestmg and certamly
commendable letter m the last Issue of thiS
journal. The wflter called for a change 10 the
procedure of electIOn of the G) mkhana secretarieS, but most Important, In Justifiably ItaliCIZed sentences, he asked for an end to the
situation when a nommated---one would
hesitate to call herelected-secretary of Sarayu
could deCIde one whole Important secretaryShIP, One cannot but applaud hiS reflectIOns
and obscnatlOns. That renowned chche
about equal rights and suffrage Just won't
work m thiS case, because for one thlllg, It
Just doesn't apply. It IS all very well puttmg
one of those ladles on the co-ordmatlOn commIttee-when was there anything startlmg

or tbe born

I'm dlvulgmg some secret
To which I've been sworn
By the barber at whose place
Muthanna was shorn.

By

. . .

The barber said, • 'TIS
the toughest nut
I have ever shorn.
Half through the job
Something struck
The razor I h:\d drawn
Across hiS bushy pate
I thought thiS
Sure IS a bIg thorn
And conSider my fnght
When the thorn
Turned out to be a horn.
Poor old Mutts was
Lool.mg hl.e a
Human unIcorn'

IT PAYS TO INCREASE
YOUR WORD POWER

*

HIS brows were klllt
In a murderou~ frown
For I had hurt
The thing on hIS crown
I tned to quell the angry drone
By sa) 109, 'SIr, I'm accldent·prone.
If you mSI~t I'll get a big stone
And knock the thing off • . .' • Let It
alone' '
He yelled. 'I've got attached to thiS
'Vonder I've grown.
You thmk I'll let you touch It With a
Rawr or a stone?
Leave It alone'
Leave It alone' '
And" Ith these words
ThiS man "ho had
Somehow gro" n a horn
Got out of my
SWivel· chair and
To the door he ran.
But Fate IOtervened ,
For as he crossed my door
HIS horn hit the ledge
And flew off, he burst with a roar
Into a fit of rage
, It's I \\ ho IS accident-prone?'
Poor Mutts said \\Jth a moan.
'What WIth lo\e and care I grew
Has gone and left me fee!m' blue.'
I said, 'Come Slf, bram
Is much better than brawn I
Why, you, With that thmg on your head
Might be hung, quartered or drawn,
By folks under the tmpressIOn
Yer devil's millIOn With a mission'
And surely you \\ III accept that
Horns are out of fashIOn
Smce the day the VIkIngs went
Attacking other nations.
These days, Sir, a bald pate IS
More of an attractIOn.
So let me, Sir, bnng out my knIfe
And be a man of action.'
He growled in satiSfactiOn.
And now Muthanna goes around
With hiS head clean-shorn
And nobody can find on It.
Traces of hair or horn.

{rom that committee anyway? One can even
accept-grudgmgly albelt-one of those ladles
m the Literary Committee, or the FlOe Arts
CorTIJmttee; but to let one of them lfito the
Sports CommIttee IS, to use a common
euphemism, a bit thick. Granted there was
that really courageous attempt by some of
them at an appearance at an Institute football
match-mcldentally both the goals agamst us
were scored after they strolled Ill-but beSides
that, we have not WItnessed any real astOnishIng event or change m the role of that hostel
In thl~ Institute-at least not suffiCIent to
warrant the confernng on one of them, the
nght to deCide "hether a hockey player or
an athlete should be OUf Sports Secretary.
A ttme and a stage have been reached when
we can stand up and deCide that for ourselves.
