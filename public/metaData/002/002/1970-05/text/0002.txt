A WORD ABOUT THE MEET
[With the approach of the Eighth Inter~IIT
Meet, an examination of th6 stated aims and
the reali:zed achie'lJetnentf of the Inter~IIT Meets
to far might not be entirely out of place. Our
staff analyst discussed the matter it, the follow~
inc article: the accompanyi1lC fjuestiomtaire
seeks to gauge public opifU'on i1l the lIT's on
the topic.]

Come Together-But Bow 'I
• The torch is lit and the orgy is on. There
is a march past of stiff-backed Olympians to
supplement the pomp and grandeur of the
inauguration. Now that it has started, the
authorities heave sighs of relief. 'rhere
is no stopping it now ••••• it will go on for
four more days, and then the gathered hordes
will disperse. The affairs is recurrent, being
suspended only when our ever~so-re~ourceful
enemies across the border drop m. - As
things stand, there's not much chance of that
now. Every Meet is the occasion for the
release of a souvenir, which lists, among other
things, reasons for the holding of the !\;teets.
This list, reproduced from the souvemrs of
the preceding years, serves little purpose
other than to provide material for the souvenirs
to follow.'
Well, this is one way of looking at it. We
could cite other opinions, quite contrary in
spirit, and equally confused in content, but
these opinions would be, perforce, random
selections. A rational and critical survey of
the value of the Inter~IIT Meet to those who
take part in tnem (and possibly those who do
not take part), can provide a working ~asis
for the organizer of the Meet to effect Improvements or. perhaps revise the idea of the
Meet altogether.
I. Is the Meet worth the expenditure of
time, manpower and material resources that
it calls for?
As the only link between the five nT's
besides the entrance exam, the Meet has been
given much importance. Some feel a lot of
it is undeserved. All the lIT's spend fortunes
on their contingents and the hosts spend a
much larger amount conducting the Meet.
The participants forgo their much-needed
vacations. Do we .get enoug.h (or anything)
out of the Meet? DO,es anyone truly believe
in the so-called purpose that sounds hollow
even on paper? This i~ ~omething we have
to face.

I.

Do you think that the Meet, ns it stands, serves its

z. Does the Meet serve its stated purpose?
Granted that the aim to foster friendship
between the lIT's is genuine and practicable,
how does the Meet enable us to achieve it ?
In the hundred hours or so one is present at
the Meet, half the time is spent in rushing
through the tight schedule of matches and the
rigorous practice that goes with them. The
other half is spent cheering one's team to
victory or jeering when the chips are down.
The contingents are housed in different
hostels throughout the Meet. Few get to
know members of other contingents. Of
course, one has a remote clutnce if one's
second cousin has got through the entrance
exam and is easily the best in his Institute
in hop-step-and-jump.
3. Assuming that we decide to continue
holding, the Meets, what should we do to
improve them?
Su.ggestions are welcome.

4. Would lengthening the Meet serve a
desirable purpose?
Most lIT's are over seven hundred
miles away from the host IIT, and the
contingents spend up to five days travelling
up and down. From this point of view, a
four-day Meet is ridiculous. A longer Meet,
say a six-day Meet, would give everyone
time to breathe, time to get to know people
from other Institutes. The tight schedules
with clashing events could be loosened up a
bit. The additional expense involved is
negligible compared to what is spent on a
normal four-day Meet.

5. Where do cultural events stand in a
Meet?

Inter~IlT

In a four-day Meet, the cultural events
will obviously be of little importance because
few will find the time to attend them or even
participate in them. With mOre time, the
cultural programmes could serve to provide
recreation and relaxation. One could then
really get to know the different facets of life
in other lIT's, their people, their humour,
their spirit.
