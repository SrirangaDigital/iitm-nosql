Summer 1970J

CAMPASTIMES

Much ~as said about tlte lack oj political cQllscioumess oj IITians.
None,jrom Cultural Week Presidents to commie reporters, denied themselves
tlte pleasure of lamenting over this sorry state of affairs. What eventually
happened made them eat .their words. U1~predictable sheep that they
were, the IITiatzs marched down to Gajetldra Circle one fine morning
led byWillie Wartaars (the head sheep), Si1!gillg fa Internationale. Alter
captu~ing ~he Admin Block, they went up to the Sellate Room and triea the
Db:ector's cigars like studel1ts elsewhere. The Sheep's Disciplt'nary Act£Ol~
Committee' was romed. A sensational trial jollo'll;ed the capture of Willie
Wartaars & Gang. The proceedi1/gs of the tdal were smuggled into
the outside world by a stringer for Time Inc whQ sold th6 rights to Sig1lor
Feltritlelli and the free 'World got sCa11dalized. Here aTe some excerpts
from Signor Feltrinelli's book.

I, the Diro, learned and wise,
(with professors who gourmandize)
run this sprawling campus.
Well, hut these chaps stamp us
• fat dictators' (which we really are
Save this overworked Registrar).
Of late, I hear, chaps in this Hall
of Learning (ha !). are having a ball,
staging stdkes and riots and smashing up cars
under their leader, Herr Wilty Wartaars.
Dear Registrar, (lId pal, pray
What, of this mess, do you wish to say?
Well, sir. this place is going to pot.
Reggie:
To pot, you say?
DiTa:
Quite utterly to pot.
Reggie:
Gone are the days of blighters who swot
their heads off; now we've got
mongoloid sadists, believe me, sirs,
who fancy the language of black-dotted curs
in the class of eminent piHars
of Wisdom .... those maniac killers
around, are soft compared
to these •.•.
Stop, you've aired
Diro:
your views. Now cut out the speech
l!-nd rhetoric: that's beyond my reach.
Get me? Pray, state the reason
why Willy Wartaars is accused of treason.
Be bdef. for Pete's sake!
(Ah, we all
Reggie: (Aside)
know how talks at the seminar hall.)
That I will, sir, this boy Willy
and his bunch have' been acting silly.
Add I must, sir, that of wont
we've called his mommy. Now don't
you think this will facilitate
making complaints and eliminate
his villainous pleas?
Have a heart
Mom:
old man, my boy ain't the sort
to plead guilty; or not.
He must stay pleased with his lot
Reggie:
and not go around pinching
ten cigars with unflinching
courage.
That's not it, mommie.
Willie:
They really think I'm a commie.
Can you beat that? Just for
a box of cigars, they'd mar
my reputation as a student leader.

• The Donald Duck Annual Reader' ?
Mommie:
Sure, son, that's what they sought
to impress upon me. . I thought
those letters to me (oh brother!)
were written by some smirking Mother
Superior.
That's what I call
DeeDee: (Hurt)
impertinence. Now let us all
get down to business. D'you mind?
Now, Mr. DeeDee, don't get cheesed.
Notice that I am highly pleased
with your work.

obvious reasons

Director:

[I'll take it from there.
Lord knows such happ'y moments are rare.]
Willie, my boy, tell me why you smeared
those poor eieph-ants that we've reared
for years. I wouldn't have done, sonny,
such a mean thing, for love or money.
Willie:
I can't see the sense in that gobbledegoo.
Had they such horrors in Stanford too ?
DeeDee: They did not! But this is a crime.
Mommie: Parsley-sage, Rosemary and Thyme.
DeeDee:
What nonsense?
Willie:
Oh, it does rhyme
and reason is not worth a dime.
(you'd give your liveS for this grill
of notices and threats, and still
prosecute the erring sh("ep.)
I Sure am not that kinda creep
to breathe with that circle around.
My thinking is not yet unsound.
Mommie: You can say that agaih. Your mommie
will testify that you're not a commie
nor a sheep. either. This place
abounds in them. What a disgrace I
DeeDee: Lord I give up.
Me, too, sir.
Reggie:
This trial hasn't caused, a stir
in their obstinate souls,' Shall we try
Papa Wartaars; is he l1kely to buy
our stuff?
Oh, no!
Willie:
(Fed up)
Stop it, I say !
Diro:
You can rip it up for ever and a day,
I acquit you of the aforesaid crime.
Parsley-sage, Rosemary and Thyme.
Do you like that, boy? Here's a box
of cigars for your rebelIjous talks.
Congrats, sonny, you're now free
to smear this blessed !IT.

DeeDee:

(Aside)

(Exeunt .Willie and Mommi6)

DeeDee, sir, don't send those letters
of warning. Let's remove the fetters.
Reg, old pal, please note
and, dash it all, you can quote
me verbatim: We must end
the pranks of Willy the fiend.
There shall be no more advice
from big shots, no matter what size.
(At this, point, there is a SOU11d of wild cheering
from outside. HUlldreds of 'Voices st"ike up

DiTa:

and rail it in speeches verbose.

But why don't you yell, my pets?
Only by yelling, one gets
things done.

DiTo:
Oh yes, Monday,
In spite of Vikram, is a holiday.
