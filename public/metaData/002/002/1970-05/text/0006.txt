VINOO HOO.N
Picture a slight, tubby guy casually and
colorfully dressed in a mustard nylon shirt
and pin-striped green togs, with once respectable black shoes (or the ubiquitous Hawaiian
slippers) waddling up to you with a bored
look on his face, and you have a. fair idea of
how Vinay Vikramjit Singh Hoon, alias Vinoo,
alias Agoogay looks like.
r first met Vinoo when we were both in
our formative years at the Doon School.'
Now that you have met him, I'd like to tell
you a little more about him.
Through an unique mixture of luck, ability
and lack of foresight. Vinoo arrived with bag
and baggage to study Electronics at I.I.T.•
Madras in the summer of 65, These are
painful memories to dwell upon; suffice ,to
say that the L.C. Department never qUIte
recovered from the shock I
But, if the years have been unkind to the
staff of the L.C. Department. they have not
left Vinoo unscathed. Gone is the old Vinoo
I knew-that sprightly mad, hell-for-leath.er,
devil-may-care fellow of the days of yore.
The new Vmoo is a changed man-old, not
so sprightly, mad, hell-for-leather devil-maycare fellow who is thoroughly fed up with the
trials and tribulations that one must endure
for the re-doubtable slip of psper that proclaims to a disinterested world that one is a
B. Tech. from IlT. A Ic.een observer would
have noticed that the bounce in one's step
drops alarmingly with time, and that this
deterioration is aggravated by the men.tal
environment around here. Where Vinoo used
to gallop around like a colt in spring, he nowshuffies morosely from A to B.
.
Not to despair, hope springs eternal, etc.
The mere whisper of a magic four-letter word
(naughty. naughty !)-film-is enough to being
back the sparkle and joy in his otherwise
glazed eyes (partially due to Coca Cola, and
seeing to many movies in ,the first pla<:e).
He is a man transformed! HIS ovenvhclmmg
charm and aggressive salesmanship soon resuIt...
in the collection of a motley band of kindred
souls, their money clutched in their hot little
hands as they dash off to the theatre. (In
this connection, credit must be given to
Aggogay for (a) his single-minded devotion to
the cause, and (b) his extensive knowledge of

bus timings, optimum routes to various
theatres and estimates of cab fares and/or
the nonchalant Grand Prix fashion in which
he dl"ives the gang in style, in time and with
complete lack of any sense of safety). Once at
the theatre, his infectious enthusiasm often
rl:suits in the gang overdrawing on their
strained budgets! _
~ggogay's passion for movies got us appOinted as Secretaries of the Film Club in
69-70 • In fairness to him, I must point out
that he is the brains of the team and that I
am just the driving force·'. The accord with
which this volatile guy and Papa handle Film
Club affairs astonishes me !

To a Dosco, work is a dirty four letter
word. Vinoo is therefore usually 'at ease';
only calamities and mention of a movie can
I!alvanize him into action. With his largeheartedness (inherited from his folks), he has
invited us over for grub many times. The
crowning point of these feasts is (naturally I)
a movie.
How do you sum up a guy like him? Perhaps Bill Shakespeare's words are most apt.. ' .... , .. , ..... , .. , . , , . and the elements
So mix'd in him that Nature might stand up
And say to all the world, 'This was a man J )
