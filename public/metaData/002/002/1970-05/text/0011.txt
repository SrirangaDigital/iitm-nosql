• It will be a long time before a girl is caricatured in Campastimes ' Chaya (D.) Rao.
Well, we IITians aren't impolite enough to presume to caricature
a lady: such things cannot be found in our book of done things (I).
Imagine a typical Campflslimes effort centred on Miss Self-righteous
D. C. Raa-unthinkable ! She'd make life miserable for a great many
people and the author of any such. indiscretion would have to retire
hurt-probably for life.
No, she isn't particularly muscular.
But you don't have to be
You just have
muscular to tie people into knots. not if you're Chaya.
to be annoyed enough to give a tolerably gJod imitation of a
reserved iceberg, or better still, annoyed enough to ,squeak the ears off
the gentleman or lady concerned. Yes, she squeaks. An odd, off-key,
musical squeak that mice ad:>l'e and bats get crazy Over. Not all
the time, mind you, only when she is excited: but then, that's
pretty nearly always.
When she's 1Wt excited, she makes conversation
with people. things, herself-one-sided conversation, edging in the first
word. the last word and all the words in between, with a triumphant
loony-intelligent look in her eyes that makes heads of departments
and district collectors wonder what makes her tick. Her language
is perfect, her speech distinct, her conversational gambits al·e·legion,
and her intentions, questionable.
Fighting, fencing or bullying, Chaya maltes her own rules and breaks
them with an aplomb and insouciance that has let the air out of
many an inflated ego. She can laugh at anything-' impossible ladies'.
, thick heroes', 'juniors'... even the great unwashed IITian public.
Gentlemen, gentlemen!
Chuya is sentimental, soft-hearted, impossibly feminine-and as tough
as nails, all at once. She arouses the worst in everybody, enjoys doing
it, and pretends to have had nO intention of doing it. ( , Actually,I'm
a very nice person.') Her eyes are bright and her grin kills people.
Sensitive people.
.
She likes elephant jokes (pink toe nails, fOUl' elephants in a Herald ..• )j
fiddles with matchsticks, striking them towards hel' sometimes,
man-fashion, just for the heck of it; and asks people to take cherries
out of martinis at odd moments. She could turn a dead-serious movie
into a hilarious comedy with her fascinating COmments (' Wasn't Space
Odyssey awfully funny?' 'We have the movies and the talkies-thank
God we don't have the smellies I') She likes oranges and flowers,
favours pockets, adores 'kutti' walks, says goodbye firmly and often,
and assault-'1 the telephone with afterthoughts and reminders.
She
/tates people chewing matchsticks (' M lites them look like toughs.')
A born elder sister, that's ChaY~I.

These. days the watchman ~t Sarayu, often hears an unmt'lodious
whistle with a hint of wolf in it. Guess who ..• uh huh, and
she learnt it all by herself, she claims. She 'knows' karate and
plays on unfair brand of championship table-tennis. Her score
of eccentric accomplish',llents reached a minor peak recently when she
added her own peculiar brand of leg-pull to the spirits of the
Campus. She hauied up a local 'thick hero' on the squeak ie-talkie
a~ some u~godly hour on the first of April with a likely story of a
kitten which had been ch:tsed by a dog up a palm tree outside Sarayuand would the aforementioned thicko please pull up his socks and
burry up and g~t the kitten down, c~use it had been up two days already. fhe th,ck~, flattered a~ betng thought as efficient as theSPCA and the Fire Department put together (which isn't saying
much for either) pulled up his' socks, hired a member of the Union
of Palm Tree Climbers. and 'made his way to Sarayu in the eye of
the noonday Stw. I:Ie m.ust .hav;: beaten the quick-tr~ns.it to Sarayu
record because he anwed Just 10 tIme to catch Chaya shnkmg off to her
a.c. lab. She had either miscalculated on how thick a hero Can be or
misesti':1 ated the ti~e it takes an eager be~ver to beat it to YOll palmyra
tree WIth a st~rvlOg, ready"to-scrath kItten atop, and incidentally,
to Chaya's delightful company.
After a soul~searjng discussion
concerning the rollicking .hilarity of the whole affair, our hero went his
way meditating on the workings of the feminine mind on kittens
and palmyra trees and telephonic conversations.
'
Like any normal girl, Chaya has afterthoughts and ambitions. ('I should
have been a boy,' 'I should have been Mata Hari.')In IIT. she hasn't been
quite in her element-mainly because there are so few people she can
bully. She haB emceed Sarayu during the Inter~hoste! Competition, won
a prize for that, written two articles for Campastimes, one in an old
issue, co-authored by Mecra Chandra Pal (' Ente! tainmen t or Bust',
Vol VII No.2, the title and a l'Couple of lines entirely Kake's work,
Grrrr .. , she says) and one elsewhere in this issue, taken part in
an Open Group Discussion (remclllber? !), been Social Sec of Sarayu for
a year-in short, she has hit the news, not in a big way, maybe, but hit
it all the same, Which is why m )st people on the Campus have
had occasion to hear the name Chaya Rao more than once. And
ima~ine, this article is going to make her famous, quote Wowie exclamatton unquote Chaya Rao.
Chaya Devi Rao (' There used to be a Devi in between-damn! why
did I have t'J say that? ') is going to the States One of these days.
She makes out to add colour and gaiety to the colour prublem there.
(' I am least impressed by skin: white, pink or black.') Or maybe she
won't. (' Y'know 1'am seriously thinking of staying on here for
my doctorate .. .') The Chemistry Department, noted for its brilliant
Staff and even more brilliant students, possibly finds Chaya a
little unmanageable and a little disconcerting, but they must emphatically agree (or maybe they aren't so brilliant after all) that she'd
be a keen research scholar, dragging shameful chemical Secrets and
molecular scandals out into the limelight with her customary vim and
gusto. Crazy, man, crazy, but Chem is a batty subj. (' Do you know
the molecular structure of Glucose?' No ma'am, we're ignorant louts.)
This likable person with a high IQ who talks a lot cannot be adt-quately introduced in any thing less th"ll a book.

such a book Plllet yO~1 folks kll(lW.
