from her. She paused, looked back to the
model in the window and then looked after
the young girl till she was out of sight.

‘ Sorry,’ I said apologetically, ‘ but did you
see another girl come in here P ’
‘ No,’ she said.

Though I knew well what the child wanted,
I asked, ‘ Do you like the sweater ? ’

I felt extremely disappointed and slowly'
walked out of the church. As I walked
along the street I noticed that there was an
orphanage. Perhaps Jane had gone in there.
I rang the doorbell and waited.
‘ Yes,’ said a nun, as I was scrutinising the
place.

‘ It’s beautiful,’ she said in a strange voice.
I knew she was trying to hold back her

tears.

I went back to look at the price tag.

It didn’t cost much. Usually,I am not in
the habit of carrying unnecessary money with
me but on this occasion I found that I had

buy the colour she wanted. You should have

seen children but never before had I seen the

sound calm, but feeling far from it, ‘ Is there
a girl by the name of Jane ?’
‘Jane what E ’ she asked.
‘ I don’t know, Mother,’ I said feeling
somewhat abashed.
‘ Wait a minute,’ she said and disappeared into the interior. Soon she appeared

enough to buy the little pullover.

‘ Thank you, Mr. James ’ she paused shyly.
‘ It’s really very kind of you.’
She must have said more after that but I
didn’t listen. How did she know my name,
I wondered.
‘ Jane,’ I said as I helped her to put on her
sweater in the park. ‘ How do you know my
name P ’
‘ Oh that, Mr. James, is a great secret. If

I told you, my father would be very angry.
Isn’t the wool very soft and_ warm, Mr.
James 2’ she said, looking at me.
‘ Of course,’ I said absently for Iwas still
trying to ﬁgure out how she knew my name.
I was sure I had never known her before.

I reckon she wasn’t feeling shy anymore,
for she was gaily chatting about the place she
lived in.
‘ It’s such awonderful place, Mr. James,’
she was saying, ‘ We never quarrel and all the
neighbours love each other. Oh, how I wish
you could be there;then we could talk all
We wanted.’
‘ Why don’t you take me there ? ’ I asked
mildly.
‘ I am sure you will come there some " day,
Mr. James,’ she replied.

again with a little girl.

She was much too

small to be my little Jane.

‘ I am sorry for the trouble, Mother, but
this is not the girl.’

She must have felt the disappointment that
my voice carried for she replied, ‘ I’m sorry.
We can’t be of any help.’
As I walked towards the main street strange
thoughts began to rush into my head. Some
of them were even silly. My imagination
was running wild. Suddenly a passage from
the Scripture ﬂashed into my mind:
The King will say to those who are
on his right hand. . . : For I was hungry '
and you gave me food, thirsty and you
gave me a drink; I was a stranger and
you brought me home, naked and you
clothed me .......

I

was no reply. A sudden fear crept into my
mind. Even upto this day, I don’t know
Why. Was she dead P
‘ Jane, Jane! ’ I called out.

‘ Mmmmm. . . . ’ came a faint reply.
I felt relieved. ‘ Come on Jane, wake up,
Jane.’
Slowly she opened her eyes and looked into
my scared face.
‘ Oh, I am sorry, Mr. James. I had just

gone off to sleep.’
‘Come on Jane, let’s go for a drink.

I’m

thirsty,’ I said.
‘ I am thirsty, too,’ she chimed in.
We want to a nearby restaurant and ordered
some hot tea. I watched her sip the tea.
After that we stepped out in the cold night
again and walked aimlessly, and then crossed
over to the main street again. Finally we
came to a little spot from where we had a
grand View of the city. It looked so charm-

Don was still wondering about the alien
face. He dared look into it only once. She
was watching him all the time. Somehow he
liked her. Probably his fascination for the
