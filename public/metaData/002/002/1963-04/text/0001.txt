A Song on the I.I.T.
There are schools in the land and the

varsities true;
There are ‘ tutes and the labs.
pupils do crew;
But the one you remember,

where

With thoughts fond and tender,
Is the I.I.T.,
In Madras see,
Good Guarantee.

Trees tall and shady with ﬂowers in
bloom,

On the deer running wood, the stars
ever gleam;
The sages dwell there,

Students with awe share,
Sciences and tech.,
Bring us good luck,

Without any check.
History and Culture with linguistics
blend,

’Nomics psycho-labourin abundance do-‘lend;

Commonsense, art~ and beautyh
