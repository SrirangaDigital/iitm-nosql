SPECIAL

[December 3rd, I962

The climate of Germany is determined by
the country‘s position in the temperate zone

with frequent changes of weather. Prevailing winds are westerly and rain falls at all
periods of the year. The average temperatures in January—the coldest month of the
year—vary at sea level from 34°F to 27°F; in
the mountains they range to under 21°F. In
the height of summer, in July, the average
temperature is 68°F, that for the year being
48°F. More than one quarter of the surface consists of woodlands.

A Glimpse at
Germany
Within its boundapies of I937, Germany is
the most populous country of Europe, after
the European part of the Soviet Union.
Adjacent to it are in the West (from north
to south): the Netherlands, Belgium, Luxemburg and France; in the South, Switzerland
and Austria;

in the East, Czechoslovakia,

Poland, the Free City of Danzig and Lithu-'
ania, the last of which was incorporated in
the Soviet Union in 194.0 ; and in the North,
Denmark. Germany lies between the 47th
and 55th degrees of north latitude and
between the 6th and 23rd of east longitude.

*

Despite the increase in population and the
growth of industrialization, 87 per cent of the
total area of the Federal Territory is still used
for agriculture or forestry. A proportion that
is only very slowly decreasing.

Heinrich Lﬁbke ﬁrst met his wife during
his stay in Berlin. At a function arranged by
the Sauerland Mountain Climbing Club, he
was introduced to Wilhelmine Keuthen, a
school teacher from Ramsbeck. She is now the
First Lady of the Federal Republic of Germany
and must carry out the (many representative
duties which devolve upon a ‘First Lady ‘.
Wilhelmine Lﬁbke cheerfully fulﬁls all
these duties which are primarily of a social
nature. She is a kindhearted and intelligent
woman. Her subjects at university were
mathematics, philosophy and German philology, and after graduation she taught at the
Franziskus Grammar School in Berlin. She
speaks English, French, Spanish, Italian and
Russian, and her facility in these languages
permits her to participate to the full in representing the Federal Republic of Germany by the
side of her husband, and to cope graciously
and easily with the social responsibilities that
form part of the Federal President’s duties.
The fact that Mrs. Liibke has maintained
their own home on the Venusberg in Bonn
in addition to the ofﬁcial residence in the
Villa Hammerschmidt is ample evidence of
her belief in strong family ties. It is an
oasis of quiet where the President and his
wife may recover and relax after their hectic
round of social obligations.
Education:
Compulsory education, since 1920, is
applied from the end of the sixth year to the

eighteenth year, of which at least the ﬁrst
eight have to be passed at a full-time school.
About 80 per cent. of all children receive their

schooling at the elementary school, which they
attend from their sixth to their fourteenth year.
Then as a rule they pass on to vocational
training. During the next three years their
attendance at the vocational school is obligatory.
The ﬁrst four years of the elementary
school known as the basic school, entail obligatory attendance for all children. Thereafter
it is open to them to proceed to an intermediate or: a‘; high school. As a rule, the
intermediate school comprises six classes. The
high school leads in general to a ‘maturity’
examination at the end of nine years; this in
turn opens a path to a university.
