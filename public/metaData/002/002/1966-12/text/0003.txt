PERSO'NALITI ES-23
It was during the Pakistan aggression. TIle
papers were full of reports concerning the
capture. of mfiltrators. From Kashmir to
Chandnl C~owk, staunch Indians went
aro~nd peenng closely at unfamiliar faces.
IITla~s were ~o less staunch. Rumours
were rife concerntng the activities of a certain
~e'\ltleman attired in a full suit (not withstandmg the heat) who ~as seen exploring the campus on a Bullet. Wild speculations were
rudel:y shattered when in walked this gentleman mto the 4th year WOl·kshop Technology
class followed by Dr. Venkatesh. 'this was
no Ayub Khan but Mr. S. S. Mani, the new
Workshop Superintendent.
• Mr. Mani alias Gear Mani is a specialist
1~ ~ear~ and has been to the continent to spe~
,Clahze In the manufacturing processes of gears.
Returning from the continent he was put in
,charge ?f the'gear division of H.A.L. and was
respor..slble for the successful manufacture of
gears for the Orpheus and Dart Jet Engines.
Wa~ing_eloquent about gears, Mr. Mani is of
the op~nion t~at a Cincinnati Gear Shaper can
be as Interestmg as a pretty girl. He feels
that the study of gears can be even more
fascinating than electronics.
.
When Mr. Manijoined H.A.L., being the
only graduate there, he found himself in a
• whjrlp~ol of politics ' . . As resignation was
~o sol~t1on, he steeled himself against petty
JealOUSies and soon proved his mettle.
Regarding industrial relations Mr. Mani
:advocates the humanistic approach• < Sweet words cost nothing but buy everything.'
Commenting on the present chaotic state of
at;raifs! he feels that what is lacking is proper
-duectlon.
, As is the director, so is the venture.' The
resources of our country are rich but there are
few competent persons to harness them sue"
cessfuI1y.
In typical workshop idiom he remarks" The .raw .-material- is .. excellent but -the :_heat
treatment is faulty'.
Coming to the -serene, sylvan surroundings
',of I.I.T., says Mr. Mani, was like walking
thro'· prison gates i.nto the-free air. His -sleep
is n? longer ~isturbed...;.,ex:cept when the frogs
are m-a musical mood. ,.
"-Living with young people, especially as he
. i,s t~e 'rarden .of a hostel? mak~s him fe!!l yo\,mg

helm of "natlonal affa1rs rather than senIle,
doddering pessimism.

Speaking of education, he feels that the
teacher~taug~t relationship is far from satisfactory. M thlngs ~Ie, (the teacher is merely
one w~o has stu~Ied t~e lesson a day earlier.'
Spea~l(~g of eng1l1eenng education, he says
that It IS at present too theoretical to be of
practical significance. The lectures should be
supplemented with industrial visits. Besides
attempts should be made to breach the rift
bet~~en industry and academic instruction.
Thts IS to a great extent possible if industries
are encouraged to present their problem.. tv
engineed"'g.;not.i~udons1ike the IIT.'s which
have research facilities.
?is advice to engineering graduates is to
. strIve to be • steel engineers' rather than
mere • paper engi'\leers.'
