For though beautiful, \'1ith large grey eyes and hair the colour of ripe corn.
the heroine of a thriller is almost never a very intelligent girl. Indeed. it would
scarcely be overstating it to say that her mentality 1s that of a cockroacn - and
not an ordinary cockroach, at that, but one which has been dropped on its head
as a baby. She may have escaped death a dozen times. She may know perfectly ~ 11
that the notorious Blackbird gang is after her to secure the papers. The Police
may have warned her on no account to stir outside her house. But when a messenger
calls at ndlf-Pdst two in the morning with an unsigned note saying "come at once"~
sne just snatches at her hat and goes. The messenger is a one-eyed Chinaman with a
pock-marked face and an evil grin. so sne trusts him immediately and. having
accompanied him to the closed car ~lith steel shutters over the windows, bowls off
1n it to tile ruined cottage in the swamp. And when the hero, at great risk and
inconvenience to himself, comes to rescue her, she wi 11 have nothing to do with
him because she has been told by a mulatto with half a nose that it is he who
murdered her brother Jim.
