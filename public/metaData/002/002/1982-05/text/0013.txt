Glad that the ordeal was over, I returned home - staying away for four months
at a stretch was something lid never done before, an experience I will never forget.
have not yet been able to decide whether it was enjoyable or not.
Second semester - 1 WiS a changed "man ". Muffi ng perios seemed a way of 11 fe
(I have accepted it). Freaking out became the law of the day - what with ~~G, GF etc
during the sem. (This year's MG was something I'll never forget.)
I've got this king sized ego which doesnlt take kindly to being pushed around
to no purpose. To do something spectacular, to attract attention, to be in the news
is something which live been longing for but some shady inhibition even now prevents
me from doing it.

Looking back, it seems to me that every single view point of my life has cnanged
after coming nere. Recently I found myself suddenly thinking - ain't I enjoying life
here. Could I have done certain things at home which 11m doing now~ All in all. my
first year has been an enjoyable experience though materially (may be) live gained
nothing. The only thing that comes through to me is that I feel like a tightrope
walker who doesn't know how far he is from either end. (What's more, I donlt even
know what either end is like - all I know is that 11m real "high".)
