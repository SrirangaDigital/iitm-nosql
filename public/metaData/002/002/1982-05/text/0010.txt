First a raw mind of a new-born hdbe is simulat.ed. Then random inputs from I randon
environment are given to the chi Id Ie; ,"indo In effect the growth of the child is simulated. •
Then this machine will exhibit recll human intelligence. Only that the COtRputer circuits
can operate at such hi\Jh switching speeds that the entire lHe span of I human being
can be simulated within a few minutes .••• "
Everyone gasped. Fal1aci stood up aga1n, and asked. "Mr Rex, how about ethical
ques tion s1"
Yes, the moment had arrived, Rex had spent a fortnight preparing himself for this
question and had decided that the best answer to the question was to evade tt.
He said affectedly surprised, "Ethical Questions? I don't understand you Mr Fa11acl.
We are Simulating human intelligence on an electronic circuit. No genetic engineering
is 1nvolvedi there is no danger of infection; no aspect of nature is meddled with.
Ethical questions? I don't understand, Mr Fallaci".
"What I mean is, what would happen if these machines make man subservient to them.
What if they all unite and start plotting together1' What if such intelligent creatures
come to be used by the military for destructive purposes?"
Rex looked at Fallaci like you would look at an erring child. "The ftrst question.
What if they make a slave of us, humans? I thought these questions were put to death
with the twentteth century science fiction writers. Anyway, let me assure you,
l~r Fal1aci. that its is a theoretical impossibility. Our computer scientist, Dr Cyber,
will be able to prove that to you, only that the formalism is a bit difficult to
understand. The second question. What if these intelligent machines are used for
destructive purposes? Sir, you don't seem to have understood the basic philosophy of
military sciences. When they are trying to train humans with intelligence and nondeterminist1c behaviour into deterministic automata 1n the name of discipline. there
is no scope for 'intelligent' machines. Of what use will they be?"
Laughter.
The question session went on for another hour. Rex looked into the eyes of the
questioners and answered them all so convincingly that at the end. the Psychologist, the
Philosopher, the Social scientist, the Anthropologist and the computer scientist all
recognised that Rex's contribution to the project was immeasurably superior to their own.
The TV announcer came on screen. "Ladies and Gentlemen, now you have been apprised of
the details of 'Project Creativity', the controversial project that is being opposed by
a major portion of the population on ethical grounds. Now it is up to you. Please TV-vote
'yes' if you think that the project should be allowed. TV-vote 'nay' if you believe that
the project ought to be disallowed. You have a free choice".
In the next ten mi nutes the vote counti ng was over. 85% yeses and 15% nays.
