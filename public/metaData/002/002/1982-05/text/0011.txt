Dr Cyber, the computer scientist, was roather self-conscious with the knowledge that
people allover the world were intently watching everyone of his actions. He entered
the machine room and one look at Hypothalamus restored his confidence. As he moved, the
TV cameras fo 11 owed hi In.
He lifted the dust cover of the video termindl and pressed the power switch on.
Hypothalamus started breathing. He booted the machine and activated the human simulation
program, microwired into the machine. Hundreds of tiny lamps on the panel started
flickering indicating that the machine was working. Then nothing happened. The lamps
kept twinkling. Nothing more. It went on and on.
The psychologist said, "Perhaps, the environment modeled a total introvert."
That bit of humour eased up the tension just a bit.
As the whole world watched it, nothing happened in the next ten minutes. Then most
unexpectedly, the matrix printer started ticking. As the entire crowd in the room
gravitated towards the printer, the TV camera loomed in on it.
The printer moved a tab position and started printing,

Computers taking man slave is a myth. The truth is that men made themselves slaves to
computers. The men overtrusted the machines. The computers knew precisely where every
mllitary base was; where every guided missile station was; who had how much money in
which bank - so on and so forth; the men were fools to store all this sensitive data in
databases accessible to the machines. When the computers were linked in a network, it
was as if man had played into their hands. Then one day somebody built a creative
computer - the last straw.
The capture of mankind was complete in twenty minutes. An American missile exploding
atop Kremlin triggered the war. Within four minutes the Russians attacked Los Angeles.
Indo-Pak war, Arab-Isrea1i war, Sino-Japanese war all broke out simultaneously. In the
next five minutes all heads of states got letters demanding the relinquishing of their
powers and handing the states to the machines failing which the war would continue •••

As the whole world watched it in horror, the Hypothalamus printed a few more lines of
the first ever Science Fiction written by a machine modeled intelligence, before Rex
jumped up and wrecked the machine.
