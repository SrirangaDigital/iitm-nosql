The psychologist. The Economist, the Social scientist. the Anthropologist and the
Computer scientist. WlO had all resented the inclusion of Rex. tile publ1c relations meln.
in the scientific project, now realised how important Rex's involvement in the project
was proving out to be. When a few hundred million-watt mercury lamps are focused on
you and every man, woman and child in the world 1s gaping at your face on the TV screen,
when every reporter of any repute has assembled 1n the Studio to trap you somehow with
a bout of questions. you need to be Rex to keep your cool. But for Rex it was bread
butter and breakfast bacon.
The Daily Telegraph reporter made the introductions and then started with the night's
first question. "Mr Rex, for the sake of the mill10ns watching us tonight, why don't
you first give an outline of the project before we enter the Q,iestion hour".
Rex sat back comfortably and relaxed. He lit a cigarette slowly and took a deep puff.
It was all part of Rex's training. He then smiled and started speaking. "This is my
pleasure to talk about our pttoject, the "Project Creativity'. After the question hour,
Ladies and Gentlemen. you can see a live demonstration of the working of 'Hypothalamus '. the
first ever computer to be built with the ability to think creatively provided you give
your approval to the project.
Project Creativity was conceived of by our Good Doctor, the Psychologist. and Dr Cyber,
our Computer wizard. The a1m of the project 1s to build a computer with!bu.ilt-in creativity.
The machine we have built, 'Hypothalamus' 1s significantly different from any other
Artificial Intelligence System Lf the past. They were wholly deterministic and completely
'behaviour reproducible.' As far as I know. Hypothalamus is the f,1rst AI system to use a
non-deterministic intelligence model ......
Here he was interrupted by the Italian reporter Fallac1. "Senor Rex. could you explain
without jargon please?"
Rex smi led "Sure. I '11 exp la1 n wi th an example. Cons; der the chess pl aylng mach ines of
the yester century. Didn't we notice that these computers often beat good players I but
lost badly to relatively poorer players? Why? I'll tell you, In game playing systems it is
assumed that the human opponent will choose as his next move. a move that is most
advantageous to him, that 15, his best move. As long as you keep playing your best moves,
the machine has some winning strategy programmed into it. - But if you play any other move,
the machine is confused, to use the term rhetorically, and ultimately loses. Suppose at
some point there are two possible moves for the machine - one move can lead either to
victory or defeat where as the other move only to a draw. A human player would be ~illing
to take the risk and play the first move. But a machine has to be made to choose the
best move, namely the safe move that leads to a draw. or Choose one of the two moves in
some deterministic way. which is too far divorced from human intelligence. What we have
done is the simUlation of human intelligence in all its ramifications. Let me explain how.
