Rise in Price

M. S Ghandramouli
If you were to stand in Irontof the Krishna
Hostel and yell ‘ What ho !’ you would
naturally expect an answering ‘What ho ! ’
But when you hear a series of ‘ What ho’s !
emerging from the top floor then you are sure
that it is no echo. The ‘ What ho !’-er is a
character whose l0oks are similar to Wodehouse in every respect except perhaps in
appearance. This is M. 8. ‘Elvis ' Chandra—
mouli whose hero-worship for two opposite
characters like I’. G. Wodehouse and Elvis
presumably has made him what he is at
present (P)
‘

Being a sporting chap he never refuses to
sing when called upon (this is rare)-usually'
after debates. The gyrations of Elvis Presley
would seem like a gently swaying Hula in
comparison with ‘ Elvis ' Mouli. The series
of contortions he undergoes would remind us

It is usual for Elvis Presley fans to yell

‘ Crazy, Man, Crazy ’ but here they probably
mean Mouli.

Karl Marx. It has been said of Churchill that

he could recite ‘ The Lays of Ancient Rome ’
without an error but Mouli could probably
repeat ‘ Carry on, Jeeves ’ along with the
foreword. His admiration for Marx increased

when he found out the meaning of the ﬁrst
word in Dar Capital during the course of
the German Lectures in the II year. Henceforth everybody was his comrade and he was
seriously thinking of going on a mission to
canvas the Formosans. But the Chinese invasion made him return to the capitalist fold.
