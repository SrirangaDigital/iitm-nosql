L‘AMI’ASIIMES

A PERIOD OF ADJUSTMENT

Obituary

OR days the class had been looking forw'ard to the arrival of the new lecturer with

increasing curiosity.

THE OUTDOOR CLUB

How vulnerable he would be to proxies and how liberal he

would be with the S’s were the subjects of endless speculation. How well he would be
able to teach didn’t seem to bother anyone. Why worry unnecessarily when excellent
text—books are available ? In the meanwhile, a few incurable optimists kept alive the

hope that the lecturer would not be a ‘ he‘ as leveryone else seemed to assume.
It is the class on Saturday. The strain of

improve matters. To top it all the new
lecturer comes into the room mercilessly on

pieces. Ignoring him half of the class walk
out to the verandah for a breath of air.
Those remaining inside are in various attir

Another bunch led by R. Veera Raghavan

A more ambitious group led by that anthropord.]ai 'took off on a cycle trip to Vellore for
a climbing holiday. A point of interest is

that on the return leg, Jai and S.K. did the

noted that the rock faCe was previously unclimbed. This is the highest mountain
, south of the Himalayas. The forces of darkness would have you believe that Dodabeta is
the highest South Indian peak, but this is a
foul imperialist lie. Smite a mighty blow for
the cause of Aanaimudi.
The next recorded activity: two months

came unstuck off the rock face, and he danced

to grief, you should have seen the other
fellows’ faces when they saw me safe, sound

Till a month ago, our climbers would go
regularly to the Pallavaram quarries on Sunday
mornings.
Of course, most of the swimmers here are

will kindly button their lips).

But as steam continues to escape furiously,
he Wisely decides to clean the board and
give the class some time to settle down. He
turns and begins at one end of his legacy—a

board crammed to the last square micron
with calculations, derivations and ﬁgures.
But only ascetics can sit passively in cla5s
daring the last hour on a Saturday morning
and soon a chant of ‘ let us of’, ‘ free period’,
‘let us off for once' begins. The lecturer
half turns and begins a futile sermon but

suddenly the duster slips from his ﬁngers
and falls on the dais with a clatter only IIT's
dusters can make. Instantly the class ex- '
presses its ‘ sympathy’ at this misfortune in

a wave of sounds. Predictably enough the
lecturer is not comforted. He glares at the
class. If looks could kill, the room would
have been strewn with corpses.
Now the lecturer begins to take the

attendance. Somebody has obviously been
giving him a few tips '; he begins as though
he has just recovered from a major throat

operation.
‘Aaron, Benjamin, Chandran .. . ._ ', he
whispers.
But the little 'trick fails. Perfect silence
does not descend. Instead a voice rises in

protest,

do not stand up, keep in mind that I can set
periodicals in which not one of you will pass.
Remember . . .’ But the rest of what he has
' to say is drowned in cries of ‘ Cheap, cheap,
cheeeep. . . .’
At last the ‘lecture’ proper begins with
the lecturer taking up his text-book. Prior
to starting his copying exercise, he asks,
‘ Any doubts on what we did last . . .’
A few chronic latecomers Straggle in.

‘ Why are you so late P ’

‘The cooler broke down, Sir.’
‘ Alright, alright, sit

Someone in the back of the class closes a
goo-page American best-seller on his lap and
stands up.
‘ What are the portions for Wednesday’s
periodical, sir ?' he asks. . .. .
With the smoothness of an old truck
travelling over a badly damaged mud-road
the period bumps and jolts to a premature
end. In impotent rage the lecturer leavesten
minutes before time.
Perhaps he doesn’t realize it, but in a week
or two, when the novelty has worn off he
