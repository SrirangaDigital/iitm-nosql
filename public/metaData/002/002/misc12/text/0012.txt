SUDARSAN
The proud clan of the Peiiubolus have had
to put tip with many a hardship ever Slnt‘t'

greatest Calamity that hit them was in the year
1946, when Pertubolu Balagiiruniiirth)‘ Sudar—

the

learned Seniors, beat them all. The bloke
came into this world with a set of rippling
muscles. Which explains why, in an age
when lesser men are known to have sought to
ventilate themselves at the bare mention of
‘ pants’, Sudarsan got away with a hundred

buskies and ﬁfty push—ups. This enthusrastie
voluntary demonstration (‘ My usual daily
exercise, anyway’ he claimed later), . one
would expect, should have helped establish a
certain rapport with the seniors, had Sudarsan

not decided to delve into the deeply religious
. issue, with D. V. Singh, as to who should be
visiting whom in hospital.
_
Ever since that day, this nadir of the

Penubolu clan has refused to let his bubbling
congenital energy and wit be dampened by
time, tide or the periodicals.
_
He took to the debating rostrum With a
passion and an emotional involvement second
only to that of the inimitable Sir Venky

Kotpath. And his 5’ 3" frame was no bar.
Where Kacker thumps the table and surveys
the audience to determine where exactly the
difference lies, Sudarsan seeks to emphasrse

his point by jumping up

in the mnate

Orang-Utan style
behind the podium,
giving the audience an opportunity to‘ locate
the source of such unbecoming neises. In

the years gone by, Sudarsan has aped Western
manners, banned the bomb, blasted Christine

Keeler and Engish politics (‘She pulls out a
drawer and the whole cabinet falls’) at Kharagpur, and, more recently, embraced the loop.
His acrobatics on the stage are marked by

similar zest and bounce, skipping ( !) in
clerical robes (l l) with Gope ( I l l), modelling the minilungi; or discoursing alternately
in radhur prophsent Sardarji Ingleece and
chaste Chenn Temizh on the ghumi adi

executed by the paithyam (muttal would haVe
been more appropriate) in the LC. engine;
chirping in from the announcer’s booth
between the acts to ensure that the audience

then : ‘ Stop banging the ball, ﬁnger it ! ’

Early indications were not lacking.

And the haven of such recluses, Campustimes, has accepted this specimen with unconcealed glee. With sickontributions like

and his teachers to consulting volumes on the
juvenile manic-depressive tendencies (whatever that means) associated with kleptomania.

ﬁligated), Sudarsan has provided ample spoof
of the aboriginality of his sinventive mind.
Yet, his greatest scoop in this ﬁeld has been
the publication of the EME Camp newspaper, Aaram Se ; a task to which he-devoted
himself with such invi orous zeal and
irrepressible enthusiasm, ong with Mahajan
(who else i), that they brought the issue out
just in time on the last day
even though
they had to romp all over town, or stay at
home to do so. Even Pilot Ofﬁcer Sankaran
did not fail to be properly impressed, when
on his usual midnight inspection he discovered that our friend was away on Aaram
Se work.
There hardly seems to be a pie in this

Campus without Sudarsan’s stubby ﬁnger in
it.

HERE are a few P.].s that I think you must hear.
First, a few cracks that you can use on those guys who pester you
about the exam you’d rather forget. The method is quite foolproof.

I have used it with total success and assure you that if you use all the
cracks mentioned, the guy won't bother you for years. And it is my.
guess that you may not even have to use all of them.
The conversation goes like this.
The inquisitive bimbo: ‘ How was the paper ? ’
You, the wise cracker: ‘ It was white and had things printed on it '.

Bimbo: ‘ You have mistaken me. I mean, was it tough ?’
You: ‘ Yeah. I couldn’t fold it with even both my hands.’
And before

you ask me, it was eight inches broad and eleven microns thick.’
Bimbo : (Persistent) ‘ I mean, how did you ﬁnd it ?’

You: ‘ That was no problem. Nobody hid it. It was there on
the table.’

Bimbo: (one last attempt) ‘ How did it go ‘I’
You: ‘ It didn’t go no place.

and the waiter came and gave the electron Rs. 2.30. ‘What about the

The waiter apologised and gave the electron

twenty-ﬁve Paise and said that that was a ten per cent tip. The
electron seemed quite happy. Before I could ask the electron my
question, we had ﬁnished a fat lunch at Gaylords which brought the
electron Rs. 18 with the tip. I was really confused. I pleaded, ‘ Don’t

NowI know what holds the Helium atom in one piece. Don’t

can readily guess, was cleaned out of its cash, being doubly charged on
each occasion. . .
If you found the story confusing the ﬁrst time, read it again.

That ought to settle any Bimbo. If you meet a Bimbo that is too
persistent, let me know. I'll avoid him.
