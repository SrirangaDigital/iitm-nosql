it to say that the problem is unimaginable.

(This provoked a turther analysis of the subject, as other IITians
became intrigued by the pOSSibilities opened up.)

If the authorities are still of the opinion that the propOsed plan can
be carried through in spite of the increased reactionisni, they \tould do

i. Compel the engineer to marry after 3 years of the degree
examination.
2 Compel him (the engineer) to maintain litmself and his Wife
on his salary only. (No money orders or cheques from home.)
3 Make him sign a bond of seruce ytith his ﬁrst employer for
a period of at least ten \ears. (The penalty for default of bond should
be quite high )
4. Increase unimpmtant paper \y ork to make the young engineer
feel quite important He being still a child, it “I” be easy to inculcate
in him an lfnprCSblOI‘l that engineering practice is nothing but Signing
papers and sendtng them through the proper channels

While commending Tee Aar on his brilliant solution for accelerating the production of Bachelors of Technology, I \yish, hoyyeyer, to
pomt out a serious shortcoming of the plan bet0ie the Ministry for the
B. Tech industry, dazzled by the impressne ﬁgures quoted by Tee
Aar, accepts the plan unanimously.
A short analySis of the ﬁrst ten years of the career 0t an engineer
is necessary to understand the difﬁculties There ts suﬂiCient proof
that the B Tech. of the present gtneration poses a proolem to the
seeiety, to his employer and to himself in the early stages of his protesSional career. At an at erage age of 21 years, roughly 97.7% of the treshly
stamped B. Techs. are still unmarried and it has been noted that young
unmarried engineers are a menace to respectable sOCiety The reason
