I still remember the day he started the
world of Stooge Acts. It was in the glorious
1964, that gone-by era when stooges were
stooges and not the disgrace to the name of
stooging that you see masquerading about
these days.
The scene was an exam hall, where our
class was doing a physics periodical. Not
the whole class really, for Channy was at
his desk waiting for inspiration. After a
fcw moments he got a brainwave! He
pulled up the answer-book and drew a neat
margin. Then he drew a life-like sketch of

Now it so happened that the lecturer, who
had been fascinated by the beak-nosed one

earlier in the hour, was studying its peculiarities from close quarters. He didn’t quite
fancy what was going on in the answer-book.
So he uppity-ups himself to the dais and

The answer—perhaps

not quite as pure, but certainly simpler, was,
‘ The temperature used in low temperature
carbonisation is pretty low, the gaseous pro-

so-so’. He got an ‘ A ' for brevity.
A few innocent ’ uns here believe Channy to
be the embodiment of brotherly love. They
had seen him at a local cinema with a bevy

this day, when their sisters begin to creep on

their nerves, they grit their teeth, thinkof
Channy and keep quiet.
Channy got his mobike when he was doing
the third year, and since then he has maintained at steady 85% attendance—at the local
magistrate’s court for speeding. I’m told that

this, plus his class attendance, is always equal
to 100%.
