OUR EDUCATIONAL SYSTEM

Isn't It odd then that a uDlversally accla1med destgn wluch has been tried out lfl

~n some of the very developed countries, has
not yet found a plaCe tn our syllabus ,
What could be the reason for tlus ~ I am
prepared to ventllre a suggcsUon but I wonder
how many Will agree Wlth me It could be
attnbuted to the fact that many of the
educated people Ul our country Just do not
care for thetr COWltry How often has a
person In our Institute prescnbed a book
published by an IndIan author 1 'Oh these
people sunply copy word for word from
Shlggley and present it as tnelr own,' tS the
statement that many a lecturer has often made

they place the rest of IndIa on one pedestal

If you admIt the theory of mveshture of
greater responslblhty 11\ the students, then
the chang~s must be fairly obVIOUS The

compulsory attendance must go In fact thiS
was tned on a small scale III Bombay
UntV"erslty a couple of years hack-a group
of outstandmg srudents were exempted from
undergolOg the regular programme Instead
they could study on theIr own w1th necessary
guIdance from the staff and would take
exams speclally deSIgned for them. ThiS
then could form the basiC structure of a
new and better pattern of educatton Penodlcals could be held wlthout InvIgllauon-a
system that has been successfully tned 1n

programmes for Labs and workshops could
be chalked out The Idea IS to make the

Whde we are at It, I may as well menlton
that the greatest drawback In the periodIcal
system IS that It IS the most powerful tool 10
the hands of the Staff to exert unsurmounta.

has been misused by some of the Staff members One often hears of the woc~ of those

so ngld a structure, mgramed WIth bureaucracy so crystalhne, that mIscalculations. mistakes, mtentlonal or otherwise, are absolutely
unalterable There IS no proVIsIon for the
v1cttnllsed student to appeal The only Imperceptible actton that 1S ever taken IS the
shunting of student from the Dtrector to th.l!

supplementary exam whIch requtres hun to
get the same 80%. Even the prOViSion to
carry upto two subjects does not solve the
above problem, {Qr, on the baSIS of common
sense, It IS not possible for a student who
does so poorly In sesslona\s to score such hlgh
marks In the finals Without any addltlonal
coachmg , he would have cleared the hurdle In
the first attempt Itself. The opt10n of meludmg the seSSIonal grades In a supplementary
examinatIOn shollid be left to the student
concerned. There IS an mterestmg case of a
