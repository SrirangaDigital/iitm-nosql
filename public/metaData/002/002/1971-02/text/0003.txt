PERSONALITIES

PR,OF'
A drowsy afternoon class and a smart aleck
ralSes his hand, • But SIr, why can't It work
m reverse too r' A lIttle respectful suence and
the answer comes back loud as a bomb ' Er
aah
I mean
I mean
I don't know'
Well, 1t IS hardly a good Introduction for a
big man In your Department. Not a good
introductIOn for any bIg man anywhere except
Mr Balaraman
• We teachers are not great denugods or
something You guys probably know more
than we do about tons of thmgs' he srud,
over a cup of coffee at the Kmck-Knack
, What the hell, after all, we are human too.'
A refreshmg change from lots of people we
know, I thought to myself-there are guys
over here for whom a questIOn IS synonymous
with a personal IDsult
It's different With Mr Ba]aram, however,
whose candour turns conversation wroch may
be embarrassmg for lum mto conversauon
which may be embarrassmg for us Forthl"lght IS the bIg word m hLS lextcon. 'Yes,

IN

A€RDf\JAV ncS !

thIS is the first tlme I am being Interevu!wed
and I am ternbly thrilled' So We went to
Knick-Knack to celebrate
For all the unfortunate masses who have yet
to meet Mr Balaraman, he IS the grand, rolypoly, smiling ASSistant Prof from the Aero
Dept, whOM: shirts can prOVide shelter for
an entIre pygmy tnbe Apparently, he was
pretty lean till he was eIght, when he had a
bout of typhOid, after whIch he blew up like
a hot-air balloon • I was called .. Fatso " In
school and, man, It hurt The first three
days I went back and cned butthen I realized
It was'nt much good' he said
So he deCIded
to partIcIpate 10 every sport that he came
across and wound up domg the 100 m In 2Z
secs flat But he would fimsh. • I guess that's
what helped me 10 hfe ' he mused later 'You
could call me self-made'
A Hmdu HIgh student, he Jo1Oed the
Aeronautics course at Madras Institute of
Tech, when AeronautIcs was sull m Its mfancy He graduated, went to Purdue for lus

M S where he became Secretary of the IndIan
Students' ASSOCIation A very quotable quote
-hiS Professor at Purdue told hun 'Balaram.
you won't make a good engmeer Why don't
you do bus mess management or someth1Og ~,
Lookmg back, Mr Balaram feels hiS Professor
may have been right RIght now, he says,
hiS Job IS more management than engmeermg
onented He dId a little shnt at HAL but
lomed lIT as soon as the HF 24 project got
bogged down
After picking our way through hiS bIographY,
we assaulted him With more mterestIng stuff
hke- 'Why IS teachmg so bad at lIT?'
• Is It')' he asked 1D mock surprise-but
candidly admItted that a lot of people who
taught undergraduates were more keen about
gettmg their M S and Ph Ds than preparIng
well for a good lecture • That IS the trouble
With lIT' he said ' too many Lecturers for
undergraduate courses aren't even Interested
