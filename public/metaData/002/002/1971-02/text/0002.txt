In the heart of the desert, where the

I met him Knm\n very affectIOnately as

He never stopped

Once there was a man, Shaw George
Bern'ltd Shaw He wrote many plays He
IVrote prefaces 09 wt'll (Infinitely better,
perhaps) Ite wa~ what w(. call an Iconoclast
He hkcd \0 bYe Ik lmag\-s or values (twlstmg
them on lhe sly) c..urrtnt then llnu derived
grl;.1t pleasure out of It He wrote a play
calkd Samt Joan, all about Joan d'arc and
prAIStd htr so much and made out that the
whole of churlhdom With aU Its associates and
affiliates would look foohsh, pOSItively silly.

I:
I hold that Shaw wrote hiS maratbon pre·
faces because he felt that he waS under no
(lbhgatlon to defend himself on equIVocal
matters, mdeed If he felt any twitches of
consCience, he normally thrashed Out a few
novel arguments, necessanly Silly, with equally
flashy examples, In el(cellent prose, one must
admit, which would fool nobody but a hopeless
thinker

The Test:
The question was to write an appreCiation
of one of the scenes In St Joan I appreel
ated It all I could I always had thought that
appreCiatIOn Imp bed a careful evaluatmn,
whIch It IS, and findmg nothmg extra·ordlnary
In the way Shaw wrote, saId so, m so many
words

The Sequel:
But, It seemed that there were cettam
schools of thought, where Ideas were prefabricated, values pre·welghed, and Conunon
sense precluded Values would not change
even With time Tlnle makes poetry out of a
battle-field It also turns mmeral water JIlto
excrement at a much faster rate.
