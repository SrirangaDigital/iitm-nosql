And nght he was about It Almost everythIng
seemed to have gone wrong \\ltl\ It the food
was cold, th<. contmgcnts segregat<.d, festiVItieS
lackIng. and spef'ches numerous Perhaps
one could attrtbute It to ll\e general aIr of

affaIr, but then. the arrangements left much to
be deSIred And there was thIS toast to the
VISItor thrown In for goodWIll People never
really dId get around, and were feehng hred
of the dreary affaIr whIch was not at all a fittmg finale to the gala affaIr that we so brillIantly
staged Maybe the conttngents could have
been dIstributed, In keepmg with the obJecttve
of the Meet, or mce party games thought up,
so that no one left feehng that It was a free
commumty dtnncr thrown on the occasIOn of
a NatIonal leader's bIrthday And there was
thIS scramble for volunteers If deals had
been kept up. those selfless Spartans would
have come and helped enlIven the show ThIS
