Ramu, Ramgopal Sharma, Gun, IS a bloke
the final year who IS In the Department of

Chemical Engmeenng of thIs little engmeermIll of OUtS He IS the captam of the cnclcet
team, 'Was the representatl\ e of hiS class and,
to add to trus already JIllpresslve 11st of
accomphshments, IS the self-app()Ulted VO!1:e of
the OAT crowd About this vOICe ofhlS, more

anOD
Ramu IS not, as many people, nus1ed by hts
name, Sharma, thmk, a citIZen bom north of
the Vtndhyas but a genurne, honest to-goodness Madrasl He belongs to that CIty 'WhIch
bas gwen m.mya fine cncketer to thiS country,
~z
Banglarorc, and studIed In that sterhng
uIStItutlOn, the Bishop Cotton's Boys' High
It was here that Jus skIll In crIcket came mto
eXIstence and was recognIZed by !us belOg
appolOted the captain of Cotton Eleven
Cricket, by the way, IS Ramu's greatest love
Although defirute!y not averse to the wiles of
the falf sex, 1t l~ cncket wluch OCCUPieS prIde
of place In hIS bosom The only urnes he sees
the blues are when Cricket lets hun down
HIS mghtmares consISts of mathes 111 which
he IS ou.t for a duck, faIls to g~t a slDgle
wicket, and finds that Ius team has been
defeated by eight ",ckets The saddest event
of hIS lIfe IS the tIme when, In seVen consecutive matches, he was out Ibw Smce then Ibws
haw been a sore subject wIth hIm Whenever
any of hIS players feel that the spectacle of theIr
captalD breathIng fire through hIs nostnh will
do them good, they ask hun solICitously about
the lbw front and ron-fast r

Coullng to rus physu:al endowments, Ramu
lB a Slll2l, tall mdlvldual, fully equIpped for
hfe With one no 5 paIr of arms, legs etc HIS
cheeks bear eVIdence of a bout with smallpol(
bactetlWD and hIS upper IIp bears a 1l'l0UStache HIS eyes are permanently red There
are two theones to account for tJus fact One

holds that Ramu doesn't sleep, the other
that Ramu IS a secret drInker The tatter
-school of thought is dymg out due to
lack of concrete eVIdence These, however,
are not qUite all There still remains hiS
VOice, "hIch IS of the loud (hke, real loud,
man) varlet), as tlte punctured eardrums of
guys unwise enough to Sit ne'lt to Ramu
durmg entertaInments at the QAT, wIll testlfy.
Ramu's throat lS appatently made, not of the
regulatIon flesh and tIssue, but of steel He
acqUIred h,s nICkname 'Gun' In Cottoo's,
because of the fact that when leading hIS team
on the field he Imanably gave \ent to a huge
war-cry of' Come on Cotton's' whIch shook
all the wmdow panes for mIles around When
he laughs, whIch, smce he has a hvely sense
of humour, IS often, the person facmg hIm
finds hJlllseif lookmg mto a dark cavern at the
far end of which two pink tonsils VIbrate WIth
alarmIng haste The so.und that Issues forth
on such occasIOns would make any NOISe
Abatement Society qUIver WIth horror
Ramu's life has been, I belIeve, a chequered
one Ever sln~e he was a !ud he has been In
and out of one scrape or the other The
exact nature of these scrapes will however, be
demed to CattJpastlmes and ItS eager readers
because when your reporter asked one of hiS
classmates to dISclose an epISode or two, the
gent declined to do so He valued hiS hfe, he
said, and would not answer for It If Ramu got
wUld of the fact that he had been the one who
had told all However, one should not
Imagme from thIS that Gun IS necessarily
VIOlent or hot-headed
He IS In fact a very pleasant and mterestlng
and good-humoured guy When he leaves,
which smce he IS In hiS final SLmeSter, IS
soon, the InstitutL wJll be losmg a fine
Cricketer and a great personahty

It IS time one real/ted that Ideas are not
pohtlcs
ThlY have a high mortahty rote
Especially ,n thL 111', as any Impartial
oo'lerVLT IS bound 10 notice dunng cultural
sess!{ms at the OAT II(cklmg 18 os much
a part of the OAT aq GaJcndra Clrek IS of
CampOli/me!· The liTlon has carried the
lettlllg off of steam too far and has convinced
lumqelf that It IS really e8..~entIal He does
not-hother to gl\e purposc..ful reasons In hiS
defence
That he IS not over-worked call be /iCen
from some Simple rnathtmntJcal computatIOns
WorklOg at 39 hours II week conslstmg of
168 hour 'l , ot wluch S6 to 60 hours Lan be
reltg~ted to legltlmate ./rep, he has On hiS
hands a little mort than hundred hours,
leadIng to II formIdable ratm of nearly 2 I
of non-working and workmg hours Clearly
no sen'llble re:Jsun can be attributed to the
chum of bottled up frUstratIon Tne OAT,
at any rate, need not be the dumpmg
ground
The Inter-Hostel Entettalnment hmge
provokes the most sangume of instincts,
rangmg also from the mean arts of aycophantry, to a morc sophlst/cated one of
slngk-stage rocketry, of course fortified
With the usual measure of vocal dysentery
of yellmg, laughter, complamts and sllIg,qcrs
The lImCere performers, poor souls, are up
agamst some of < the most enlightened of the
ehte set'
The typIcal IITlan breathes air m. and
airs out Not very conSCIOusly perhaps,
he IS trapped In hIS own makmg He clIngs
desperately to clus flimsy atmosphere In
fear, tn defence
Jealousy bnngs ()~t the
WOHt kmd of mstmcts 10 man
Envy IS
the cause whIch he so carefully tTles to conceal
The dlfi"t.rent culture he thmks he has raised,
IS enough to Justify hIS act'l m a very corny
sense What he IS not capable of understandmg, he condemns For all the aIrS he would
like t() dIsplay, he IS mediocre Any supenor
act by others goads hIm to Jealousy, anger,
and finally to condemnatIOn The feelmg
of lInpotence causes frustration and above
all the thought of another person havmg done
one better, shatters him He cannot stand It
In the other case, ",hen the show IS really
below the mark, he tu.rn-s magnanimous,
applauds lustily, would hke 1t to sound reaUy
cymcal As long as hiS ego IS not tollched,
he IS safe ThIS puts hIm In the more
generous of lus moods, and very condescendmgly, almost out of PIty, he cheers, hldmg
all the time under the pretence of sarcasm.
PIty IS despicable more so when It comes
from people themsehes to be pItied No one
wants pIty It IS the feelIng 10 man, very
harmful, very dangerous It lives
What the IlTlan IS not prepared to accept,
15 the shameful fact that after all these years
of carefully cultivated mannerisms and tastes,
hIS core 1>. stul prImitive, hIS senSe of humour
not very dIfferent from the generaUy ac<;epted
value. Pierce hIS aIrs and expose hIm 3S the
hollow crushed wmd he really IS, and he
would meekly scuttle off to the lesser PQst\lte~
where he could still masquerade under the
same artIfice A few foolIshly stubborn mIght
brand the mquIsltor a pseudO-intellectual, a
snob, a dilettante One has to humour
them for theIr own sake.
