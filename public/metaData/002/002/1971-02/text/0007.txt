Back agam to the last tOPIC, the education
system Response was decent (just barely)
for comments on the IITlan system but we
spoke to a lot of people and everyone felt
that plenty of thlOgs wcre wrong With It but
generally speakmg, cculd not suggest a
completd) different system which IS better
than the eXISting one Biggest peeve \\as the
supplementary system which IS deVIOusly
faulty (you can fatl two years In the same
year by failmg In two consecutive semesters)

Politically speakmg, the average IITlan IS
no better than the guy who votes for the
candidates \I ho gIVes hlm ten bucks Know.
ledge about political Ideologies extends to
one liners (Commumsm means spreadmg of
wealth), gleamed from hIghly slanted medIa,
Reader s DIgest,
TmU! etc
There IS
also a Widespread dIslike of commumsm The
comment IS not meant to be a plug for the
commumsts but the po lOt IS that the hatred
IS mostly WIthout any factual knOWledge, but
It IS understandable because the only maga
Zlnes an IlTlan gets to read are ultra·rlghtlst,
filled WIth Amencan propaganda ' Why the
Kremlin wanlS war' from Reader's DIgest
IS a good example

narrowed people S outlook but has paved
the way for bIgotry

Even more dangerous are statements hke
'Send all Mushms to Pakistan,' and 'Indl~

Plm Koh Lal (plm of short), no relation

the httang shop Thl.- mstructor accosts him
With a ' MISter why you come late tell me

two minutes The Instructor brusquely takes
hun through a yard or two and unaccountably sends him off to the place of work
The Intro to flltng IS a channel whose
arms have to be atomlsed Peppy Plms
dashes off With Ius Hans3 Bastard He 18
promptly pulled up and asked to ' filch, filch,

bad praetlc!. and IS belIeved to make radiUS
In subsequent classes, much of workshop
grammar IS expounded m SPICY lectures, the
core of which IS Irrelevant to fillmg The

A five-week course m the carpentry shop IS
remarkable from the pomt ot grammar and

to suppress displeasure and castlgate With Wit)
at an ell,cellent slmde-' your fit IS like a cigar

When Plms' stomach sounds the sIren
(roughly an hour before the workshop sounded
Its own) he slips out to an allurmg establiShment a hundred yards away, regales himself
and returns soon, lest a smart Instructor
should tale It mto hiS head to mark the
attendance at the end of the class also When
such long-mterval bunkmgs are unposslble, he
goes to the water cooler Unmmdful of a
