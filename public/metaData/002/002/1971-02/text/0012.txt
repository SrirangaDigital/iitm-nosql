A Letter from RGP

Waiting for A Dead Body
• DoCtor, We got an emugency'
, What'", Wrollg ?
• Wt.ll, he ~ got hIgh fever:
'Hmm
• HIs nngt.rs ha\e gone all numb and he 1&
findIng It tough to talk'
• Wherl an you talking from ? •
• Nannad~'
• Who are you ? '
'A ~tudent'
• Tell )ou[" Al!slslBnt Warden to rmg up'
So along came our Ass! Ward
• Doctor, we got an emergency.'
• I will not come'
• I beg your pardon '
• I will not come to a men's hostel'
• Btlt he's tembly III
• l'th on lea\-e, and I'm not feeltog well
either'
'But doctor.' No dIce
To save hme we had a Warden drIve along
to the Doctor's place eyen before the Asst.
Ward rang up That didn't help eIther So
we dumped the guy, runmng 104°F. mto a
car and had hIm taken to the doc's place (If
Mohammed mil not come to the mountam,
the mountam must go to Mohammed)
Granttng that students arc untnlstworthy
creatures, nrc A~st Wards also to be lumped
mto the same category? And WardeM 1 It's
about time the ,\uthorlllcs did somethIng
about such. matters A doc gets mQvmg
wnen an emergency call comes And don't
give a damn whether the doc's a lady or a
gent If the doc's on lea"e? Or If doc's
Ill? Win the authontles make arrangements
to COVer such Situations? Don't kt's walt
for a dead body to get us moving Please

I was asked for my Imprt.SSIOllS of the 8th
Inter-lIT M(et and IUIH' readIly consented to
commt-nt on wh1lt I saw heard and did In
th.n hLCllC week To bcgm With, but not
at thl beglnmng, for my opinIon of hfe and
eompl-t1tlve sports that drag you I,COO
m.Ils and dump )OU, dlshevdled and miserable, on an ahen door"tep at two U\ the

category

are common knowledge

Of llT.M
Campus comparisons, the first step In any
hne of strategy, leaves us qUIts Just glVt:!
us the deer and the forest and you can have
the Wide open spaces No cramped-up
apartmcnt-dwellcrs are we, but one day's
trudgmg and some w~re ready to nm
screammg home to the c:omfort of their diSreputable bonc-shakers-If they could get
out of the campus, tll'lt IS For the girls, It
was a hltch-hlkers' paradise Ltfts were easy
from professors In powerful foreign cars and
Peter ronda fans alike (Maybe It was the
KGP smile that did It) Honestly those
fearful dIstances must be makIng strangers
of you all-separaung metallurgIst from meteorologist and chemIst from carpenter
I hope It Isn't only the eighth time you've all
met 1

Of the Meet:
Colourful, grand spectacular or Just plain
prehmmary to other matters on hand, the

openmg ceremony 1& Itke a chIldhood dlseaae
-mesc'lpable fout tense days foHov.ed which
were a culmination of hopes, speculattons, and
efforts WlI1nlng Ot lOSing, ench day htld Itll
own tfinIs and tribulations Till tl\.... last
trophy was gIven away, there was a battle
to be fought. Not ttll then was the Meet
over and the championship lost, a traditIon
shed away and the blUer outcome to be
faced The da~ \n between wefe pleasant
and enhanced by our prIVIleged statug as
guests The food, though a futll~ tOPIC of
cOnversatIon, was not of the kmd to provoke
Violent reactIOns Dcmg typIcal of Its location,
It probably came as a nasty surprl$c to a few
The ("ampus had really set out to welcome
uSo--Qr rather THtlR Meet Che Guevera
and hIS band of volunteers made the Boy
Scouts look ltke a bunch of Bulky brats
In wmdmg up, a little gas about the old
urnes will be permitted, I thInk The general feelmg about Inter-llT amongst many
of the students IS that It IS the monopoly of
KGP not only In pOints but also In partlclpatlon lind enthUSiasm CYlIlcaUy, It has even
been saId that the Meet lS held only to
prOVide KG!> With the satisFactIOn of wtonlng
I have no d()ubt that III-founded notIOns have
been dl~pened by the elaborate preparatIOns
and eager partlclpatlOn whIch wl-leomed the
Meet 1I\ Madras It was taken as a chance
to prove their mettle by wmnlng the events
and by successful organIzation
Well done and cuddle those trophies as
much as you want We will be back for
them next year
