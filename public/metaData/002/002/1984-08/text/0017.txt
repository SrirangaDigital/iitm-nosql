THIS Min MALADY
Sometimes, not too seldom, I have
had the opportunity to notice that
I didn't generally belong to the
conversation of some of my pals.
Initially, when I was supposedly
'goodyagoody' I would stay out of
these conversations altogether.
Now
that I'm just 'goody', I jump in and
out of such conversations with a

frequency

similar to‘that of having

letters slipped under my door by the
postman.
.

Anyone who knows me well enough
would know my retort - 'Look here!
So what if she's taller.
I'm cleverer
than her.
I'm ... than her.
I'm
better at .... than her.
My God,
man!

Even Napoleon Bonaparte was

and Great.

Same here,

man .

It makes no goddamn difference.’
'Oh yes!
It does!

You're RAT.

It's

just not the same.‘
So,

once,

I

started my‘march

towards impending doom by one of my'
usual comments.
'You kndw something

I quite‘like that girl ....

She's

pretty decent and un-tomboyish ....'
Before I could finish,

'Anyway, Rat, go ahead! We shan't
discourage you. Not at all.'
-- And I said I knew how encouraging
they were.

'Hey!
Did
you hear Rat.
He said he's flipped.
Imagine Rat flipping.
It's just as
improbable as his taking drugs or
smoking.‘
I tried to defend myself.

'Hey!

Don't overdo it!

reaction if I truly fell for a girl
taller than me.
-- And I said that the girl would
understand better than them.

I didn't
-- And I also told them that I hadn't

say anything except that she was
pretty decent!
And moreover, I'd

flipped.
-- And they told me it was high

like to tell you chaps that there's
nothing wrong even if one does flip.
And they went off again, only too
happy at noticing my indignation.
'That means he's really flipped!’
... And all their eyes turned to
me!

And all of them roared with
laughter!!
.... And I joined them too!!!

time I did.
-- And they said they knew girls
short enough for me.
-- And I said I was of normal height
5-4, and that I only looked short
because I was skinny.

-- And they said - 'Rat, don't flip
for a female who's FATTER than you',
and madness started all over again!

Then, one smart aleck spoilt the
fun'(only to add to their fun) by
saying, 'But Rat! she's taller than
you.‘
And another large package
containing peals of laughter.
