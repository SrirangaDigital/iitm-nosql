real engineers (as distinct from managers and academics), simply
because real life situations generally don't have direct text book

explanations.
The Specific problem may actually be of more than casual
interest, since the principle behind it seems to have potential
applications in chemical processes, and it is probable that it
has been exploited already.
Anyway the point being made here is not that the question was
not answered correctly, but that there was almost no interest shown
beyond casual corridor exchanges, except by the meagre dozen who

attempted an answer.

Even after the solution was diaplayed, it

was a computer science student who took the trouble of coming to
get some points clarified.

The remark made earlier about the IIT

system refers to the attitude that anything outside the covers of

Piskunov or Resnick & Halliday (and later, other text books and
class notes) can be safely ignored because it won't fetch grades.
But it would appear that any ability to think beyond text book
situations gets suppressed already in one semester, if not at the
Agarwal/Brilliant stage itself.

Perhaps this factor correlates

poorly with the ability to tackle problems of considerable mathe-

matical complexity, at which IITians tend to be wizards.
The prevailing academic system has its own momentum in a

particular direction, and individuals, whether students or
faculty, may find it convenient to just drift along with it in
the pious hope that some benevolent agency would be directing our

activities towards the betterment of the nation or mankind or

Whatever.

Now with the increasing prevalence of computers, we

may be heading for a situation where anything which is not
amenable for manipulation via a keyboard and display screen will
get branded as obsolete.
