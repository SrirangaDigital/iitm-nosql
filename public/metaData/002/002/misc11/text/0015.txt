four possibilities for the home block which belongs there.

If situation (1) occurs, we first identify the top colour of
the home block.

Next the cube is rotated until that colour comes

to the front face, and then the top layer is turned so that the

home block is in position A1 or B1 in: as in Fig.7, to suit case a)
or b).

Finally we execute sequence R0 or ID, which will move the

block to the correct position at A2 or BZ.

In case of situations (2) or(3), we have to first send the
troublesome block to the top layer, by rotating the cube until

the block comes to position A2 of Fig.7a), and then performing

sequence 30.

This will lead to situa-tion (1) which must be dealt

with afresh.

Once we have established situation (4) all round

the middle layer, only the tOp layer remains to be sorted out.
