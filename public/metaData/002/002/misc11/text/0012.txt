a specified sequence.

STEP 1.

COMPLETION OF THE BOTTOM LAYER

A systematic description of this step has been deliberately

omitted, because it is more easily done than explained, even by a
trial and error method.

So without burdening the reader with

trivial stuff, let us assume that any one layer has been completed.
Keep in mind that a correctly completed layer should have a single

colour not just on its face, but also along each of its sides or
edges.

Referring to fig.5, the finished layer is at the bottom,

and mostly hidden, but the two visible edge colours can be seen to

be uniform.

To make it ready for the next step, the bottom layer

has tobe turned so that each edge colour matches the adjacent
centre block as seen in the figure.

Now that the top and bottom faces have been established, they
retain their identity through the rest of the solution, while any

rotations of the cube whenever necessary will affect only the sides
or vertical faces.

At the very last step there is a possible

exception to this.

STEP 2.

COMPLETION OF THE MIDDLE LAYER

There are just four edge block positions to be dealt with in
this step, and for each of these the correct 'home' block will
be in one of the following situations:

1. Somewhere in the top layer
2. At a wrong location in the middle layer
3. In the right place but wrongly Oriented
