Who remembers Rubik's Cube today?

It got pushed into the

category of passing fads by overblown publicity and commercializaâ€”
tion.

But its intrinsic charm need not be denied or forgotten, even

if it is no longer the 'in' thing.

Though the cube was responsible

for much excitement and despair among puzzle fans and even

mathematicians, many of its published solutions were needlessly
lengthy or complicated or loaded with technical jargon.

For those

who simply gave up, here is a brief and simply presented procedure
for arriving at a solution to the basic problem, i.e. separating
the six colours, one to each face.

The subsequent discussion of

the method is provided as purely optional reading.

For most of us it would be helpful to have a cube in hand
while reading through the steps of the solution.

But even other-

wise it can provide ideas for developing independent solutions and
recording them in a concise fashion, since the method presented
here is in no way unique or Optimal.

It was in fact developed

entirely by trial and error.

Before starting with the solution, we have to agree on some
conventions and the meanings of certain words.

Precise definitions

are not necessary, but some words appear in capital letters where
they are introduced or explained in the text.

The meanings of

terms will generally be clear from the figures, which are all
free-hand sketches of the sort which any reader can draw for

himself or herself without much effort.

There is no need for

using different colours, or even symbols to identify the different colours or positions.

Sketching will be aided by placing

the paper over a blank square-ruled sheet.

Since a consistent point of view has its advantages, we shall
