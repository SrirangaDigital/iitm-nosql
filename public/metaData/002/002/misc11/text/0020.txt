"SLANT BOTTOM PRECHAMBER IMPROVES DIESEL COMBUSEGNN"

Conventional diesel engines employ prechambers for combustion

which may be of the swirl type or the precombustion type.

In the

swirl type of chamber a spherical chamber with a tangential outlet
to the main cylinder, is the combustion chamber.

The fuel injector

is positioned accuratelyto achieve good performance.

The air in

the chamber undergoes a sttrl (uniform rotary motion — as opposed

to turbulence which is random) and when the fuel is injected good
mixing occurs, leading to better combustion.

In this article we shall discuss the new Mazda small capacity
passenger car diesel engine} employing a

swirl combustion

chamber design with a slant bottom which the engineers claim

improves gritical ignitability.

According to the engineers of Mazda, the ignitability could
deteriorate by performance and economy improving measures such

as lowering of compression ratio and speeding up combustion by
strengthening swirl action.

Injected fuel hits

the slanted corner of the chamber where it mixes with air, which

improves ignitability.
