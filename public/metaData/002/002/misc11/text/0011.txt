but also their ORIENTATION which has to be correct, because a
block can be in the right place but facing the wrong way.

Wrongly

oriented blocks are illustrated in Fig.9 and in Fig.6(case 3).

In each case a row of blocks has been

shown shaded merely to emphasize the layer being turned.

All

other turn symbols can be interpreted on the same lines.

‘A two-

headed arrow indicates a double turn.

Rotation of the cube as a whole can also be represented
conveniently by some similar symbols as shown in Fig.3, though we
can do without their use

in our solution.

SEQUENCES
At different stages in the solution, certain groups of turns
haVe to follow each other in a definite SEQUENCE.

The seven

sequences which are useful to us have been named for convenience,

and are listed in Fig.4.

They have been arranged vertically, just to emphasise the

symmetry of the R(ight) and L(eft) sequences.

There are really

just four distinct types, and our solution will consist mainly

of repeated use of these sequences in different situations.

Two

sequences may be given together, such as R2+L2, when they have

to follow each bther in that order.

It is important that the

cube reference must not change during the execution of a sequence.
