ODE TO A BLACKENED BANANA,
Sitting there

&'1

black of face -

Whet ails the., solitary banana?
Crevest thou to join thy fallow bananas
In the coiling maze of the intestine
That endeth in

fate worss than deeth?

Thou wast once yellow But slowly the spotted visage of aga
Stole aver thy beauteoue .kin.
For youth. indeed, ia fleeting,

And now, the outstretched arm, the gaping mouth.
G~pe.

for thee no More.

And thus ton the shalf- thou pin. at -

Black wallowing in squishy mi.ery Alas, truly, oh gallant one,

Unwept. unhonoured and uneeten.
