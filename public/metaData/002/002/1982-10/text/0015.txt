But the one question that ranl(--les in the mind ie: ::joes one such trip help to
improve underst anding between (among?) the two campus sect ion s
students do not interact daily with the Deans

etc~

~

After all, all

The need for a better mixing

of staff and students is at the departmental level and I would v. nture to suggest
that in future such experiences be more frequent at that level.
to exotic places are not' the only way.

After all trips

For example, last year the students of

Civil and Met arranged a similar get together away fram the Department..

So 1 would

exhort some interested students and faculty (there are sizeable number of such
people) to take it up at the departmental level.
The success of Kalpackam get together was due to one such bend of dedicated
students and staff and I am

t~'erefore

optimistic that similar efforts will

definitely be very fruitful and will thus contribute to a bettar and more harmonious
life on the campus.
