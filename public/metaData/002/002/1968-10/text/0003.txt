SIDEKICKS
(In Good Humour and Without offence)
Though the origin of the term 'Sidekick'
is obscure, it has gained wide currency in the
Campus and deserves our attention. It is unfortunate that a subject of this importance has
hitherto been neglected and we shall now
proceed to remedy this defect. Several interesting and imaginative theories have been
put forward regarding the origin of this
phenomenon.
A popular school claims that it all started
with the influx of STAs into the Institute.
Another, equally strong in its views, claims
that it originated with the influx of mopikes
into the Institute. Be that as it may, let us
proceed to the definition of a sidekick (alias
Sidee). This is the crux of the issue. Sidees
are available in all sizes and shapes. Some
conform. to the former school of thought
while some justify the latter. A sidekick is
defined as 'one who supports his hero at
all times, places and in all matters.'
Despite the very limited advantages conferred on a sidee by virtue of his position, it
is surprising that we have a large number of
sidees in the Campus.
This fact calls for closer examination of
the . phenomenon. From a psychological
viewpoint, one is tempted to conclude that
this is the outcome of a desire for 'Identification '. . For example, a person who
admires British manners but lacks the moral
courage to pursue this goal identifies himself
with a person accredited with this cha):acteristic. One does not have to look far for
an example of this nature.
The price that the hero pays for having
a sidekick il? sometimes heavy. Poor Roy
must have had many of his hours wasted
listening to the exploits of the Navy.

In some instances it is difficult to distinguish between the hero and the si~ekick.
The roles can be interchanged dependmg on
the time and place. A strong analogy that
suggests itself is the Covalen~ bond; ,i.e., an
equal share in the partnership. ThIs. equal
share .is an average value over a penod of
time and not an instantaneous value. By
similar reasoning, we can say that the former
case conforms to the polar bond.
In some cases, the need for identification
is so strong that one agency is not sufficient
to satisfy this need; and so this individual
resorts to a number of agencies and is
called an Universal Sidekick. Though these
cases are rare, there are some clearcut
examples.
Even as we have an Universal Sidekick,
we have an Universal Hero. This implies a
high reactivity-chemically speaking, a high
valency. Also, being a sidekick himself is
not a disqualification for having a sidekick.
Though this is feasible, actual cases are
rare.
The nature of sidekick relationship varies
from expedient to fanatical. A typical example of the former would be C.B. to R.K.
Since we value our bones, we shall not
attempt an example of the latter.
We must apologise to the reader for the
rather cursory nature of the. analysis. However, we earnestly hope that some of our
readers will devote some time and energy for
a deeper and far-reaching study of this new,
interesting and rapidly expanding phenomenon.

A ReQUIEM
The long day draws to a close
The journey comes to an end
The skies .gaze with red, unblinking eyes
While thejlonely traveller
Having trod his weary way
Burdened with the cares of life
Now goes Home to rest.
. No tears for this man
No words of comfort or solace
Or even a drop of \vater
To quench his burning thirst
He goes unwanted, unheard of,
uncared for.
Tho' one of many
His plight is pitiable.
He looks upwards
And closes his eyes.
Each step was hell
Each step tortured him
But he had continued
Undaunfed
For he h.ad the suppoit,: ~
Of a sturdy staff
That took a part of his weight
And' alleviated his pain a little.
That staff was his sole support
The str~ngth it had, it gave to him
But alasf AB nothing that is too good
Can exist for long
,
An unknown hand snatched that rod
And he fell, weighted as he was
And he diedl
Now he lies
His lips closed for ever
The heart that had throbbed
Is now still.
His eyes thankfully closed
No thought creases his forehead
No joy lights his face
Nothing is of any meaning any more
For he is dead 1
