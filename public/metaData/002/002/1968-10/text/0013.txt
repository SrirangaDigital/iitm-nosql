CAMPASTIMES

As the lift took me to the specific door I
contemplated the chance of it crashjng down
and while the other two with me would die of
shock even before we impacted-I would cry
I hurrah' and onlookers after
I'm done with
with life. would discern a satisfied smile on
the lips. But such things don't h!lppen because
OTIS elevators do not intend going out of
business.
The lift stopped, 1 looked around, made for
a wrong door and then the right one. • Dr.
A. E. Narayan, Doctor of Dental Surgery and
Orthodontist' • (For those who might think
the last word is a printer's devil. it isn't. Nor
is it, for the organic chemistry-minded folks,
the dentist who works on a tooth next to the
tooth on which one dentist is already at
work).
I opened the door and went in, placing myself on a soft sofa. Nervously I picked up an
old magazine. It's surprising how dentists,
aU having a flourishing practise, manage to
keep only decl:epit magazines.
Eager to know how people around me reacted, I looked around. An oldish woman,
reading a cheap USIS publication about John
F. Kennedy wasn't bothered. This couldn'tcare~less attitude was not in keeping with my
condition. and I was not a little irritated.
But soon I reaHsed that there were others in
the same boat as me. A tough looking, mid~
dle aged bloke who looked normally in the
habit of knocking off his adversary's front
teeth when a difference of opinion arose between the two looked like a chicken. A chicken mind you, one lonely, cracked up chicken!
With a sardonic smile on my lips which
further unnerved him I passed on to the only
other person left. Apparently there was
nothing the matter with him, but when he
opened his mouth to put on a semblance of a.
smile, to say a sort of a hello, I don't remember seeing anyone with more braces. Speaking would be an exercise in weightlifting, so
he gave it up in favour of a smile. He and I
were the younger ones and smiling once in a
while gave each other solace.
Soon it was my turn to be attended to.
The pretty attender gave a smile in .my
direction. There should be a Jaw agamst
girls smiling that way lOne of those smiles
that picks a guy up no end at a dimly lighted
dance floor when the moron is doing nothing
else but dancing. Now it was, to say the
least, out of place. Besides she was making
light a very serious situation.
I walked in---.
I don't wish to tell you about the
dreamy atmosphere that prevailed there. I
had a most decent time and nothing un~
pleasant ever happened. Why, I even remember thanking the dentist, warmly shaking
his hand an.d giving the nurse a 'Willcome-again' smile.
I walked out of tIte clinic and into the lift.
Nice chap this lift man. Always smiling.
Dale Carnegie must have dedicated one of his
books to him.
I started the walk back to the bus stop.
So exhilarating a walk in a stuffy climatical
surrounding was, at that time, something
quite normal. The wait at the bus stop was
not agonizingly trying, but the Wills filter
cigarettes advertisement was cute. The bus
came along a.nd only my limited knowledge of
Tamil prevented me from embarking on a
vivid account of • The Visit,' to the person
seated next to me. t reserved the ordeal for
my friends in the Campus to endure.

Epilogue

.

The above is fiction. May be those of you
who have been. to a dentist never had any of the
above experiences-but to adapt a quotation
by Irving Wallace who quotes Somerset
Maugham • The habit of blasphemying a
writer for the exaggeration with which he
conjures u.p light humour is indeed a bad
one:
-HYDER.

Letters-(contd.)
One does not have to flood Campastimel
with serious contributions. But it does not
hurt one to do some serious thinking, at, least
occasionally. We have OUr omnipresent
periodicals. few of our eveninp are free and

And Miles to go
Be/ore / Sleep.

Almost 98% of the full-fledged IITians just love to sleep. In
fact, who would not 7 in a place so full of stresses and strains (But
alas, where is the time, with the nights. shortened by tutorials',
placticals. and of course the eleventh. hour periodical preparations?
Now that classes start at 8 a.m.) the IITian gets to sleep halfan-hour longer. But even then some of us feel that seven hours'
sleep can't be very good for health. How to compensate for the
missing three hours is the question.

For example, Annapi11~i sleeps from 4-30 to 7-30 in the evening.
He can never sacrifice his sleep for play. But Bondaji cannot help'
playing. (He represents the IIT sometimes.) His s~rong determination to put IIT Madras in a position more honourable than the :fifth ~
at the next inter-IIT meet prevents him from sleeping . . . in the ~
evenings. He sleeps in the morning. (?) Dh yes, he does! He ~
sleeps for 2S minutes every period. He finds the plan one helluva
convenient one. But nowadays one finds him sleeping with his eyes
wide open even in his room.
Tranquilizers are hardly needed for the IITian, who can drop
asleep instantly. Wh~ch is why Kokah generally sleeps with his door
open. He does not know how it happens, especially on periodical
eves. I know Ramjoseph Kumar sleeps in Thambimugam's room,
where he goes to mug - - as he puts it. If the Director were to
appoint a commission to enquire into the rising e1ec:ti-icity consumption, the verdict would be unanimous: 4 Most of th~ boys sleep with
the lights on.' A pity that most of us are light-sleepers. . • . (1)

But the worst-hit fellows are those who replace or do service as
alarm clocks. Pagalam Quick, for that matter, wak~ up regularly at
6-30 sharp. :But he has to wake up Iruvum Late and many others
... before and after brushing his teeth, before and after breakfast,
and sometimes before leaving for class. Heaven knows, were it not
for guys like fagalam Quick, we would not have any class at all in
the first hour.
There is a tale about Mugpot Alam and Atamkot Maran who
mugged one helluva lot on Friday night for the Periodical on Saturday.
In fact they sat up so late (so early, if you like that better) that
shortly before the test both of them dropped off to sleep. When they
got up, they were fresh and alert and in prime condition to write the
periodical - - Monday's, periodical, nyuk, nyuk !

Heard of a guy in the news who did not sleep for years? How
the IITian would wish for such a constitution. But I betcha Half-acoke that even he,
If he came to IIT
Would drop asleep instantly.

SLEEPLESS

we are nea1'1y starved of the right kind of
companionship-granted. So we must also
have our share of fun-granted, again; that's
why CampQ$times contains predominantly arti~
cles written in a lighter vein. But let us not
imagine ourselves to be martyrs. We slog, it
must be admitted, more than the student outside does. But still ,ve do have our spare
time and we do enjoy some advantages like
some nice movie every week where lots of
people let off lots of things. We can give
some little time for serious thought. And our
society needs it. Our country needs it. IlT
should not merely produce engineers who
have a sense of humour "bordering on the
coarse. It must produce intellectual engineers
who are not cynics at twenty, who do not nod

their heads sagely and say 'To hell with.
SOCiety and duty yar. Let us make money ,_
young men who feel that they should do their
bit to better the society they live in men who
feel they will be none the worse' for doing
so, are what !IT must produce.
Let us get rid of this fad for lightheartedness in everything. Humour has its time and
place. A. serious man is not necessarily a killjoy. He can still retain a. sense of humour and
look for the subtle father than the ribald. fo];"
finesse rather t;han coarseness. Gape's cups
of tea are admttabI'e examples of what a judicious mixture of seriousness and hmnour can
be.
Yours etc.
