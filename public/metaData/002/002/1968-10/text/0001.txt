GOING

The ye!lr has indeed started with a bang.
With· last year's inaugural fiasco still remaining
fresh in their minds, the organisers decided to
eliminate the usual lengthy speeches and
provide an in~ugural entertainment. For once,
,as a result, the OAT was packed when the
General Secretary K. S. Loganathan introduced ,the office-bearers of the year to the
audience. The Director, while formally
inaugurating the Gymkhana, expressed the
p,ppe that its activities will receive a boost
thi!i year. He observed that the Institute
Magazine will I?ear a lot of improvement, and
that although. we have met with indifferent
success .in the Inter-University Sports tournaments this year, we should fare well at the
Inter-IIT . Meet to be held at Kanp'uc in
December~
With an, eye cocked on the
forthcoming . Inter-Hostel
Entertainment
Competition, the participants put in a lot of
hard work and the effects were visible in th~
improved standard of entertainment put up.
It was nice to see Solomon and Ebbie back
again and we hope we' will see more of them
this year.
