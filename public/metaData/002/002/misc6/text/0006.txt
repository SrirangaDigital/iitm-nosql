It had rained, it had showered'
I had been sittingamidst the gusts of wind and
the incessant rain,

water trickled along my skin in dewy drops of treasure,
Past my sidelocks, into my clothes - my soddy wet
clothes,

Which clung to my skin like a second one.
I had never felt such bliss, such a feeling of warmth
in that cold shower of liquid,
I felt my emotions warming me up as
I saw drops falling off the broken edge of a twig
In dewy drops - a monotonous cycle"

"'Light my light, the wonld- silling light.

Ah, the light dancei, my datling, at the

It stopped raining.
The earth sucked up all the fluid like a thirty dog,
Who had never before tasted this nectar of summer.
The sun slunk away, leaving behind
Dark, dingy rooms, and poet's enfranchisement.
The dew hung heavy in the air,
The city lit up; the temple rang bells,
Night entered its deeper phase,
Tubelights threw their light at me The lights pierced through the mist,
The dew was lit up like candles,
Light lit up my eyes, heart and my soul,
-And the 'poet' in me.
I looked at the shades of dewy green,

, The reflection of the lights in the water,
SUKANVA RATHNAM

I heard the crooning of a few late sleepers,
I was still wet; my paper wasn't!
- I sat down in the silence,
Interrupted only by frogs' merriment, crickets'

..To write my POEM.
