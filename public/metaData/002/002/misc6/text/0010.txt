A rain of colours corrodes my eyes
Flaming tongues lave my skull
Bowed beneath these scurfy skies
Thetouch of rouged and haggered suns
These moments spawn forgotten lines
'3mmsetraced by a broken, dangling bone
As I sip the clear arrack of madness
The night erupts in me
Like in a town, the pox
The bitter distillate of yesterday
Chirrups from the root of my tongue
This monstrous clockwork of the sun
And stars and moon and flowers
Infuriates me A gelded giraffe stretching his head
To plumb these cavernous lies. ,
