(Shed a tear you h~artless
brutesl) Farfrae having married Liz is now far from free and has to
arrange for the ex-Mayor's funeral. Having killed everyone ,he
safely can, Hardy striking another sombre note (in extremely good
voice by the way) decides that the reader has had enough (actually

HELLO
(

It's a burning burning flame
That's driving me crazy and act silly
the p~rson to blame
is one heluva charming filly.
She's lovely with features feline
In her, beauty is in its pr~e
want to ,know her better and make mine
What all I ask is ~imme some time.
Her hand I wish to claim
And to the world I hereby proclaim
It's a sham that's what is society
In it what you need is a Godfather strong
With you 1f you have someone mighty
Then you can get away with any wrong.
That's why I crave not for pseudo fame
Nor care for shame
I'll be happy so long as I have my dame
but only if I could know her name.
