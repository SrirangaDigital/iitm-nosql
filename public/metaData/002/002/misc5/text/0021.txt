The Government was not in the slightest bit. relenting. The
students were aghast and confused •••• They did what they knew to do
best - resigned themselves to the situation.
The Placement Office was mobbed and suddenly the companies found
willing scholars eager to join them. GATE suddenly became more
competitive. The lIT Post Oft ice reported a sudden drop in the mail
and the Facilities Centre received certain books in extremely large
numbers, which were however sadly left unsold. The Professors heaved
a sigh as a major portion of their paper work was done away with. A
certain organisation at Allahabad was reported to be considering
closing down since there was a dramatic decrease in its activities.
Time has helped the IlTians to get over the cruel blow, but such
things inevitably leave their scars. The IITian of today is quieter,
more reserved than of yesteryears and as he talks he sighs wistfully
and it does cost him an effort to break out of his depressing thouqhts
into his usual sunny self.
They have framed the commiserating letter from the past students
of lIT (H.Q.: NY) and hung it in one of the hostels. Moves are afoot
to organise a museum wherein will lie the tomes of QB in state, and
the myriad books and tapes now sadly unused. all of which helped to
bridge the gap between the two mightiest democracies in the world.
