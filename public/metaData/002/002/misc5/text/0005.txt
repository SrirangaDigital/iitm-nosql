1) There are 100 squares arranged as a 2-D array of 10 x 10.

The
squares corresponding to (1,1) and (10,10) are removed as shown.
You have to make pairs of adjacent squares
till all the squares Rre exhausted ('Adjacent
squares' are those which share a common side).
The quest10n is to prove that whatever be the
manner in which the pair1ng is done, two
squares will always remain unpaired.

2) If you move 10 km South, 10 km East and 10 km North you are back

at the starting point. Where on earth are you? Relax, don't
jump to the North Pole immediately; you are not at the north pole
i.e.)another point on the earth satisfies this detinition. Which
other point?
