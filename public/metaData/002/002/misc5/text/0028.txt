The Openbilled stork is a large black and white
waterbird, somewhat resembling a vulture in
flight. It can be seen overhead in large
groups, in the evenings and morni~gs. A colony
of around 300 birds lives in lIT, and goes out
to feed elsewhere, everyday. These birds can
be observed in their~ests, at close quarters,
from the top of SAC. The openbill gets its
name from the gap between its mandibles~ which
is p~esent even when the beak is closed. What
exactly this gap\' is for, no one knows.

The Whitebreasted Waterhen is heard
more often thc~ it is seen. It is
noisy in the rainy season and makes
a mp+allic krr-kwak, krr-kwak ••••••
noise, which has been likened~to the
sound made by a bear when skinned
alive. In appearance it is grey,
with white face and breast and
a bright red patch under the tail.
It can be seen during the monsoon,
wading in water-logged areas. Its
relative, the Indian Moorhen, is similar in appearance and can be seen
at our lake.
