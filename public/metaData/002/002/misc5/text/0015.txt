No inspiration there. Perhaps I should get more intense

protest
My voice fades away ••••
Caught in the whirlpool of authority
A thin and quavering leaf
Swept away to unknown depths of impotence

Beating against walls of paper files
Bound together by red tape
Believe me, they're stronger

I dislike classes on the whole
I have support for this, I am toll
This attack on the cranium
Like, the bombardment of uranium
Is hazardous to both body and soul.
Mathematics is lengthy and numberous
Chemistry is equally slumberous
Physics is crazy
It just makes me lazy

Aw mush. Let's go back to the field. The chap next to me is
protesting too. He emits an occasional snore. Very gentle, almost
a moan of suppressed anguish. His hand is poised on his notebook,
all ready to record The Wisdom. There's this fly doing a tango on
his nose. Adventurous fly that. It tangoed all the way down his
nose and finally reached the rim of his mouth. Took a look in,
shuddered visibly and flew off.

The voice of the teacher droned on
Then the sun rose and soon it was morn
I picked up my bag
And mv piece for the mag
And stretched and walked out with a yawn.
