In retrospect-U you can allo\\ any retrospecttng o\er three IssueS-It \\asn't a bad
year for Campastlmes More peopk read
more ot the magazine, more Important people
read a little more of the rnagaztne, so that Its
semI-notOrIOUS, semI-dIstinguIshed edItors
will not be forgotten In a hurry We got
ourselves censored' for the first tIme In
hIstory (how about a medal for that, Ed ?)
and managed to r:use a bit of rumpus about

On the con SIde, WIth all our effort', we
have Just barel) touched the surface In attemptpublic Interest Onl) three
people "rote about our educatIOnal s)stem
and when )Ou reahze there arc eIghteen
hundred people on campus It s enough to make
ooe SIt and bawl Pubhc Interest IS a fancy
tale In lIT The onlY Interestmg theorv I
have come across as to why 1t IS so IS that
people here have too much secUrity A Job IS
assured for 99% of the graduates, so everyone
Just bides rus time and Ieoks the other way u
he doesn't lIke something, so he can pass out
WIth as little ado as pOSSIble and hve hapPily
ever after Only when the student sees
starvatIon In the faCe, IS he gomg to wake up
and fight
mg to rouse

CULTURAL WEEK

Even though tbls IS an yearly aHalf, the
compulsIOn to wflte about It IS Irresbuble
Tills year's Cultural Week was the worst
orgaruzed ever and no sadist hke me IS gomg
to let anythmg hke that pass wltbout comment
Minor wars were fought on the sldelmesbetween Secretanes-and WIth half the
Entert.a1nment CommIttee dlssocutmg Itself
from the other half, the sldelmes proved far
more mteresung that the entert3.1nment CallIng that entertainment sounds lIke HItchcock's
Idea of a Joke My sympathy lies With the
Judges who had to actually keep looktng at
the proceedmgs Thanks must go to the Leo

THE GYMKHANA
The Gymkhana, goes a daft defimtlon, IS
a vague, undefined body which the Staff, at
Hmes claim IS a student-body or, at other
times claim IS a Staff student body, dependmg on the SUItabIlity of the occaSIOn
• Thmgs must change,' say the stll.dents, bu.t
what all the Secretanes \\ Ind up dOing IS havmg
Gymkhana teas and chasmg gU"ls The fault,
obvlousl}, hes neither With the Staff nor the
Secretanes but the "\agueness which rests
around what power the posts carry The first
thIng that must be done IS to define the postsflexlblltty IS ridIculous when there IS nothmg
to be fleXible WIth Only when there IS
power, \\111 the liT Staff stop lookmg down
on Gymkhana as SOllle kind of a Joke the
students have perpetrated on the Staff.
ThiS year, It seems that an attempt IS beIng
made to change the election system, the latest
being that all GymkhJ.na SecretarIes will vote
for the coveted posts Instead of only the
concerned Committee Though thiS IS a step
for the better, It IS really nothmg much The
Gymkhana General Secretary's post must be
a one man-one-vote selection, If the Staff
Were to regard hIm as a representatlve of the
whole student-body If pohtlcs don't playa
part In hostel elections, why should It when
the Institute goes to the polls ~ The autholltles
must at least give us one chance to see If we
can keep It clean Ne"t year, man 1

ThIS happcned In the office for the Pres<.rvatlon of Wrld LIfe, In whICh my uncle I~
a bIg sh{)t They arc extrtmely happy, h..
In~lsts, because tilt dmmJ.ls are happy
But
ne grows Ul~tant1y sober and then almost
melancholy whtn he says, • But the IITlans
are not as happy aq they should be
Hc
further adds, • They arc dull, umnterestmg
and politically dumb
(The last revelatton
was sensational, the papers grew eXCIted and
accused the CIA of trying to subvert the
IndIan youth )
So, a year ago, he was ordered to enqull'e
mto the sad state of affaIrS, but he arnved
here only last Monday He moved mto the
Dlro s office and asked hIm gltbly, 'Pray,
what IS the reason for all thiS sadness ?'
Dlro shook hIS head, gave hIS usual broad
smile, and replIed non-commlttally, 'Well,
we hardly eVer notice It' My uncle who
expected a grotesque and excItIng answer
Withdrew and bumped mto the Security
Officer The Giant saId III reply, • Sad?
Who IS sad? Nobody IS mad I '
TIred, exasperated, he sneaked mto the
Canteen and asked a Semor Professor over a
cup of coffee, 'Why are these people so
muthless. dull and unmterestmg ~.
The Professor replied m hiS usual evaSive
style • Mmd you, It may seem paradOXIcal,
but the most umnterestmg can be the most
mterestlng,' and smJ\ed m praIse of Ius own
WIt when he said, • To a psychiatrist, you
know I'
Startled, our well Wisher hopped out of the
place and pulled hIS nerves together He
would have succeeded, had rus gaze not
fallen upon the theme of thiS epw.ode, the
IITlan. Cautiously he approached hIm and
tried to Interrogate him 111 a very low tone
The other looked round and grunted, I Sick,
shut up l ' and after a thoughtful pause
shouted, 'Scram J'
Our friend crashed to the callous road It
took a lull hour for hun to reCover and then
he found the pIOUS figure of the Registrar
bendmg over him and whlspenng, 'Why do
you ,ake your brams? They have not become
unhappy suddenly By Nature they are hke
that'
My uncle shuddered Innocently when the
regIstrar said, • The periodIcal IS a part of
him '. and added nochalantly, • And he IS a
part of the penodlcal '
