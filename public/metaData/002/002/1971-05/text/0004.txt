Who owns the Workshops> Mr Ebert, that's
who He IS the Work-s Manager of liT
Central Workshops-the blgge,t non-productive "orkshop In India-and he has been here
beFore hmes "ere so good When he arrtved
In 1959-and that was t\\elve years ago-the
only thmg exlstmg was the foundation stone
A pretty ImpreSSive record, )OU might say
• I have mstalled 1I.bout every mach me here:
he told \IS uhen we "ent to interview hunand when a man hJ..e Mr Ebert says that you
can't think he IS braggmg
'Valk Into hIS office sometune and forget
about the formalIties-Ebert IS not one to
waste tune saying dungs Ilke good mor~mg,
State your busmess and out comes a yes
slip before you have e"en finished You
would probably go m and ask hun to lend
you the mlllmg mach me, and he would gIVe
you an • yes ' shp Without so much as lookmg
up ' I trust the students,' he said, ' After all
fiT IS buut for students and If you don't
trust them what else IS there?' A lot of
SUpefVlSOrs' feel that undergrads are Just
a IIllnor lITltabon m the paradISe, and that IS
puttmg It mildly
Mr Ebert lsn't Betrlcoolelter for nothmg
H you asked lurn about hiS love life (I dtdn't),
hIS Wife would probably Come out a close
second-to maclunes I After four years In a
place hke dus, talkmg to a man who IS really
mterested In hIS Job IS fantastic. After hours,
he reads about aircraft, unhke us morons
resortmg to spICier literature You can see
the gleam In hIS eye when he speaks about
a gear cuttmg machme or a uruversal mtllmg
machine, and you know the workshop IS In capable h<mds U nCortunately, as It turns out With
our beautiful bureaucracy, the hands aren't
exactly free
As most of us would have noticed (If you
haven't man, you're dumb) students are
second class CitIZens In the workshop Ever
tned to get anythmg done there ? You need
half a dozen 'yes' sltps from Mr Ebert before
you can dnll a hole there ' What gIves? '
we asked • I know It's a problem: saId
Mr Ebert, • but the mam reason IS fittmg
and machme shops are ternbly understaffed
So the foremen try and get nd of the small
fry Wlth httle obstacles Now It s become
a way of hfe for them I can give you all the
• yes' shps and tell them, but what more
can I do? I do suppose more staff would
help
, What about all the cheating In the workshop?' we asked, and Mr Ebert, he didn't
bat an eyehd, • Sure there IS cheating In the
• Petty thefts are coromon-some people workmg
here actUally have a second Job outsIde and get away
WIth It

workshops, not only of matenal, but also of
time. I e\ en know the people who are domg
It regularly Ktckmg them out IS another
pomt though' Apparently, once everyone
I" made permanent, kicking hIm out IS next to
lIDposslble, unless you catch hIm red-handed,
which also IS a formidable task, unless Mr
Ebert buys hunself a superspy outfit • I can
make the Central Worshops the best tn India,
If only I can kick out half a dozen lazy men
But
' he flung out hiS hands In helplessness You know the story about one bad
apple In the basket-\\hICh IS why the Workshop IS the way It IS.
Mr Ebert not bemg the kind of person
to duck questions, we could get mto trouble
prmtmg all hIS rephes If you want to know
what else IS wrong With the workshop, go and
see hIm If you also want to know why we
have eIght weeks of fittmg, go and see lum.
After a small talk, you wtll come out
convinced that greatness beginS WIth gettmg a
fiat surface In one mmute of filmg. Oh,
by the way, he wasn't a Panzer tank commander, he was only a small boy duckmg
the Alhed bombs I When he goes In 1973,
It's gomg to be a sad day for those who want
to get anything done In the workshop-those
lIttle • ye~ , slIps Will he gone WIth him And
dnllmg a hole would be unposslble, Dear
Dlfo, take heed I

Itself upto accepting thiS whtle we afe here,
there can be no reason at all to reject thiS
The Inter-Hostel Sports Meet evoked the
usual enthUSiastic response--on the final day,
that IS, when every extra man meant extra
vocal pressure on the Dlta to get on WIth hIS
usual sequence of hush-blush-and-declare the
next day a hohday Honestly when one
meandered on to the field on any of the other
days when the so called heats-they could
Just as well have tossed-were bemg held,
one took qUite some tIme to recall that we,
as has 50 often been stressed by Navzer, had
won the Inter-lIT Meet It was Just amUSmg unul, when they had to press a hostel
attendant to take part tn some event, It became
really pathetic I mean, not that one expected hordes on the track-who would ltke to
see the stadIum tumble down anyway ?-hut
surely more people must have known that
50methmg was going on somewhere m the
campus
The glut of the Hostel Days IS on and
people go around qUite cheerfully, spendmg
the evenmg hobnobbing With those prlvtleged
among the Staff and others Such as they
are, one adjures them to watch what they say
and do, because It IS so, so easy to say and
do the wrong tlung.

The Cultlltal WeLk 1 Th\s really was the
year of gentlemanly behaVIour I:scorts and
ushers throngLd the Jomt and one felt really
glad that there \\as no dearth tn thl campus
of people who could play the gracIous host If
dus was welcome condu.ct, one couldn't
qUite find the words to descrlbl the gentlemanly reception that the audience accordtd to
all the particIpants Except for stray characters-like the one who voclferou,ly tnslstld on
knowmg why the conductor of the MCC
slngmg band wore a walstcoat-Navzer and
gang must be feeling thrilled and stunned
No descnptlon, of course, of the 1971
Cultural Week ~ould ever pass for any thtng
but hypOCriSy Without a ftw words-hasty,
perforce---on the much-debated QUIZ programme WhIle It has been universally
acknowledged that thl8 18 onc of the most
difficult eVtnts of the week, one can't qUIte
underst~nd why the orgarusers tn!>lsted on
calling a real character to conduct the whole
thing I mean, when a person goes about
bungmg Insults at younger people-and that
too tlrmgly repetitIVe Insults-and wants to
pass It off as a matter of style, then It 18
hIgh time people started thmkmg tWice about
puttmg that person tWice In a position where
he can do thL bunging
One wouldn't want to ils..OClate oneself
WIth any other comments made on any other
of the offiCials of the Week All credits,
however, to those people to whom the credit
natunlly goes, for haVing brought the whole
thmg off In such scmtlllating fashion
The elections came and the elections went,
and beSides a hohday did they leave behind
any traces of a dawnmg enlightenment?
People kept thelr fingers crossed during the
countmg-some cursed while others exulted
and one felt for a shan time that thiS sense of
Involvement was what should charactenze the
honest CItizen. After all only those deeply
attached or concerned WIll ever bother to take
Sides With such vehemence and volubIlity
But, one wonders, IS It really necessary?
Is the fact that the lady In power seems
relatIvely unfettered now, really and truly
gOing to make the dIfference some thmk It
would? Even granted that megalornama was
a motive of a very few, while more mundane,
monetary reasons were the dnvmg forces
of the victoriOUS parhamentanans, IS the
fact that they are there gOing to alter the
fate of rmllIons so drastically?
The time has been reached when one has to
admIt that we have dduded ourselves With
the belief that cIrcumstances and happenmgs
are absolutely Irremovable under the control of
those at the top-those whom we, the knowIng ones, detest We have all the whtle been
hvmg m a paradise wluch couldn't qUite
be characten7ed as one of fools but as that
of deltberately blanked out mtellects (IS there
really that much of a dIfference ?). We have
been qUIte rIghteously assummg that what
one does as an mdIvldual-hlS actions, hIS
words, hiS code of honour-have httle or no
effect at all on the passing stream of the world.
because we happen to have been born and have
to eXist In a country where that stream IS
fairly Jam-packed with our fellow-creatures
whom we optimistically call • men'
thus WIth thIS rather thread-bare cloak of
It-doesn't-make-a-dlff-anyway, we have reached a stage when we attnbute all the Ills of the
wOrld-alllts so very many blemishes-to that
hated breed of politiCians
One wouldn't qUite like to find oneself
besIde that very red • MOl.Ultams have been
moved before • ' appeal that went around
the campus sometime ago, but the essence
of what one would like to convey IS more
or less the same There lS no salvation
WhICh IS not to be found In and achIeved by
ourselves Wh Ie the last thmg one would
want IS a mechanIcal uninvolved pursUit of all
that virtue which we would hke to stock
ourselves wlth, a httle more dedication to the
thmgs we do-wouldn't hurt at all Whtle
OUr defenSIve cymclSm may not qUite find
