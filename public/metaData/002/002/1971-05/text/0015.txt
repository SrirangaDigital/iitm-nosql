M usual, the Inter-hostel boxlRg competition drew a larger collection of IIpectators
than any other sport However, then. was
an additional feature to thiS y~ar's conduct
of Ihe competltton the convenuonal venue
Vllr
Ganga Hostel quadrangle was rcplae~d
by tilt. OAT arena Of course, as a rule, It
tamcd on the day the first bouts were
schcduled to be held
Now for the lOner details, a, to what exactly
went on In the rmg In all, thirty-three boxers
took part- an aU-time record I Twche of
them vt.ntured Into the rmg for the first hme,
but only a thud managed to get Into the
final bouts A speCial word of pr:l1se goes
to the plucky Linus Rego of Alakan'lnda who
lost narrowly to the ultimate wmner,
Sashldolran, In the bantam-weight.
The final day saw RaVI h.nnnan, one of
the more aggressive begmners, punchmg away
at the more upcnenced Shorty Nair, dnvmg
him to the ropes Howe\ cr, Shorty sooo
resortld to hiS agility and expenence and
won the tI}-welght title
Sasldharan and ThlagaraJan, another
begl11Jler, fought It out for the bantam weIght
htle Sasl, With hIS more accurate punches,
w;lS the WlOner
The feather-weight class brought about
the biggest upsets In the preltmmary round,
both Vmod Bhatia and Sastry, last ycar's
wmners m bantam and feather-weights
respectively, lost narrowly to Ashok DSouza
and Dandekar. In the finals, however, A~hok
disaPPOinted the audience, glvmg a walkover
to Dandekar.
The weltcr-weJght class saw a dose and
fast pundung pair m Prem Watsa and
begmner M S Choudhury The latter was
adjudged WlOner and Prem was the best losel,
p<lmts-wlse
Next, there was the hard-hltung battle

between J V Pall and Naltn for the 1Ightweight title
Nahn who appeared a bIt
shakvagalnst Chandlramanl on the first day,
was more BClentlfic and rCSlahve The title
went lus oppont.nt's way
The fight betwecn V IClor ThamburaJ and
RaJagopal III the ',ght-mIddle class was an
one-sldt.d affair, Victor bemg the winner
HIS three year-old repulallon mIght have to
do with tht. furegone conclUSIOn

hiS not-so-scientific lacttcs, Anand, With hiS
longeT re'\ch, kept hl8 opponent'll at arm',
It.ngth and won the title
Theil calm. the fight everyone looked
forward to
bet\\el'n Mohan Peter and
V. K Raja Though Mohan 8eemed to give
m meekly In the hrst round, he qUIckly
adJush.d hiS guard to parry Rap S punches
and combJnt'd Jt WJth adequate SCientific
Jabs to put up a goud fight Raja, however,
was the winner
Th<- day had the biggest upset In store
for all round, a little late to the night
The last tight In the heavy-class saw unlucky
