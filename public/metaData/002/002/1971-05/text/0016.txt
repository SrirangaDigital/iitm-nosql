maddenmg Clever chap, he lets It be known
that two gIrls are needed for the play, the
thud one, havrng Just undergone a transsexual operation at the hands of tlus brtlhant
young anthropologIst He flatters us a !ttUe
bIt about bemg energettc and tells us v.hy
we couldn't Jllanage to get the girls gOing

Tramlntlon l\hmcograph AuditIon AudItion I~ n great Ilung to tlo You have t'Hnty
odd gU)S bunched up III a room and you can
stIli aVOId ctlamlht~ Only when you havL
all the twenty guv ... wantmg to play the same
parts, you're up to your ncck In trouble

noone \\ould make a better loon
There
agam \\C encounter someon<- who slldkcs hIS
ll<.ad Ilke a cunnmg doctor tnlb like a piOUS
preacher and walks like a burly Inspector
But that was JlO problem The cast has to
be chang,d Inywa>, or so the crystal ball
tdlb u" Eo cHrybody has n part lo\\ards the
end of the day and Wl walk horne With the
first rehearsotl on our nl1nd~
The eX'lms come ;md the rehearsals stop.
We plan to get do\\n to buslncss on the
twentieth of December Duned If anyone
turns up Postponed to sl"th, and word
corne from the bright gIrl (don't ha,e any
respe<:t for my jUdglment) that she Isn't
gOing to be nO Madame Sarah Sarayu has
unendmg po;;slbJlltles, espeCIally where
Mauame Sarahs arc concerned Another kid
comes along and boy, IS she bnght I ThIrteenth of January the play gets promptly
dltchld because we couldn't get '1tarted on
the rehearsals Sane deCISion one must
admit, but what sttcks In the craw lS pamful,
the inability of e\en the elite lITlon to do
anythmg Shght p<.rsuaslOns are enough to
kmdle tne-\\hat do they call It-the creatiVe
fires of the dIrector who does a bit of
warranted recastmg and We settle down to
work
That IS when we learn that you could walk
down a stage hundred and one ways, you
gotta know where you are standing, and
mamly that actmg Isn't an easy Job after all
Mr DaVIds tells us how they used to go for
pIcniCS With the theatre groups so that everybodv gets the feel of e\erybody and so forth
(Much as we would have Irked to, there
was no ttme for such Jaunts mto the wIlderness and stuff) We stld. to the Ladles Club
and the Irntatlon of seeing (lousy) badmmton
pia} ers 10 the process of trymg to sttl'le theIr
laughter The heat IS on The prospect of
appearing on stage lD outlanwsh Wlgs and
costumes wears our nerves thUl and the fact
that we are desperately under-rehea~ed
doesn't help much eIther

18th of february da\\ns WIth all of us
bemg hustled to the Museum Th<.atcr And
ther<- Wl: rehearse Ith professlondl~, on
hasltly snatchtd mlaJ~. '1dnl.lwlch.. a and coffee
Th<- /Lroth hour appro.lches merCIfully At
mmus ten, the mOfl lUTlOUS v3nety watches
through the pcephok against everybody s
better Judgement Ah, ye~. you can see
whose aunt IS sitting where, but apart from
that you see nothing but row and rows of
chaIrs Sad Wdl the <.rowd backstage 18
r<.ally ehte They know a comphcated plot
whln tl\cy sec one May ll\. someone goofed
up all pubhclty Or the morons out th<.re In
the sylvan surroundings aren't made for tlus
ktnd a stuff
Curtam tIme Two hundred and fifty 1n
the audIence Talk about mIracles I Curtain
ttme What tIme IS mote sanctimonIOUS?
The rest, of course, IS hIstory
TIme for cUrtam calls As the enthUSIastic
audIence gIVeS us a standtng ovatIOn (they
f/Jere standing), we do our rehearsed bow-andsmlk act And then we have twenty odd
guys from the audtence swarmIng on to the
stage and qcreamlng praIse for the Director
and cast That was mce There was a hit
If you ever saw one
The next weck, we have people ml~dJy
repnmandmg us for puttlng up crap Itke thlS.
and some lady-guests, too, expresslDg their
displeasure In no mdder terms Doesn't say
much for them, I am afraid Heck, we even
pnnt<.d a synopsIs for them which was as
confusmg-subtle as the play The synopsIs
The end of the play leaves a big questIon
unanswered What are the phYSICists to do?
To be 'sane' and dnve the rest of the world
to msantty? Or be madmen forever 10 the
hope that humantty Will be left alone? They
are not some cheapskate, sermon-spouting
SCIentists who talk as If some Martians are
always danghng froln the tlp of theIr sh,ny
noses Rather, they are the type who talk
sitek and act fast The problem that confronts them, does not contront most of us
After all. we are not all Oppenhelmers Yet,
how these phYSICIsts, brllhant but human,
nse upto the occasion (or buckle under) m a
lunattc asylum, symbohsmg our bIZarre world
ruled by manIacs, forms the plot of the play
Let's leave It at that

(Two days later, we had a great party It
lasted ttll breakfast-almost We Wlsh It
could have lasted !til the next play.
