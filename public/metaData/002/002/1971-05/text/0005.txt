and a great many other profeSSional groups
have reason to be grateful to Dr ZUrn
Dr Zurn has no patience With people who
want to turn lIT 1\1.adras mto a tl.l..t book
unIversity That, m hiS opmlOn "ould be
and IS a terrible calamity, and we, as students,
agree, not merely because we dislike textbooks
Llalson Wlth tndustry and close
study of mdustnal operatIon should be a
basiC feature of techntcal education, at least
10 lIT.
We should have more Staff-members
with mdustnal expenence, which means, of
course, we should have more Staff-members
who know what they are talkIng about
IIT owes a lot to Dr Zurn, for what he has
done for us and for the Ideas he has put In

Walk mto any decent-slzed bmgc, happen109 anywhere In Madras, and you Will find
Ramu bossmg around tht.rc Actually, that
was a bit of an exaggeratIon Ramu doesn't
walk. mto any show, only the oneS he can walk
Into Folks, meet V Ramaknshnan, Ramu for
hiS friends, and Secretary Ramu for the
NGO~ of the Institute
Secretary Ramu' Yes, ever SIDce he entered tlus jomt m '66, as one of those
Mohammed Nasstrl types--short and squat-,
Ramu has been makmg It to the big shot
gang year after year FIrst, he shanghaied hiS
co-freshers mto votmg \um In as the G Sec
of Jamuna Hostel, and the most wstmgUlshed
career m orgamzatton m the hIstory of IlT
was launched He came to be known as the
guy who can get thmgs done pettod Smce
that was the crymg need of the day, Ramu had
nO trouble at all 10 performmg the unique feat
of bezng the G Sec ot hiS hostel for three
years lU succesSllm (Doesn't say much for
hIS hostel mates, I guess) He soon found
out that he was more popular With the bus
drners, conductors, watchmen and sweepels
and the lIke than the students He paId a
pretty heavy price for thIS, hIS mess bIlls
were fantastic
\Vhat With hIS tender relatlonshlps With
everythmg In the Institute, entities and nonentities, movable and Immovable The Gymkhana guys started leanmg heavily on Ramu
to get 'thmgs done' Pay,> to have a boss,
sometimes Well, there was such a mad
scramble for t\us commodity that Ramu could
only muster uP, enough breath to sa}, , Okay,
yar I U do It, and do It
J'.lo wonder the
great unwashed feU for Ramu, espeCially the
time when he, havmg filed hiS nommatlOn for
LIterary Secretary, deCIded to back OUt zn
favour of hiS opponent, .lnd Just managed
to lose, 10 spite of campalgmng for hiS opponent
wlth missionary fervour and zeal The 5-6
break-up showed that the camprugn could Dot
beless convmcmg, In the light of Ramu'~ preVIOUS record
The Carnl\al held In " 0 was an alJ-round
Ramu affair He was never to be found In
classes dUring those two months, he managed
that pretty ,... ell, by making hiS professors
slog along With hml Ramu IS kno\\n to have
had certam volatile affairs With some members
of the staff dunng thIS pertod and m the
subsequent months Bemg the mall he IS, he
has come out unscathed
Ramu has a passIon for hlkmg After hiS
South India tour on two \\heels h(. can Just
