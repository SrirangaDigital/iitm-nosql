Monday
Bunking classes started bnght and early for
the 1\.\1 India debate (}yotl Nlvas) Incidentally, "hy don't they cbange the name to
Um\ersal debate Or somethmg, \\e might eVen
land a Martian blonde The orgarusers
wisely decided on a trendy tOPIC
Equality
of the sexes \\111 bnng about dlsmtegratlon of
Soclen But they were m for a surprise
The audIence (and the press) discovered that
32 competitors were that number too many
Before the ad\ ent of the h.nth deb'lter every
one had heard the names of Indua Gandlu,
Eve and VIJayalal..shml Pundit, the sterlmg
examples of woman's suffrage, quoted ad
nauseam Oddly enough, the majority of
the gltls spoke agalDst Women's Lib Upholdmg the chastity of Indian womanhood, no
doubt, but none of them touched upon the Idea
that dlSmtegratlon might be better Even
standard cliches Iu..e ' Vlve la difference' were,
for the most part,lgnored and highly Christian
morals expounded by more than one speaker
Very few managed to hold the Interest of the
audience, except NaUlan of MCC, Rekha
Shetty of Stella 1\1ans, and, of course, the
two IITlans Though the speeches were
uniformly mediocre, the highly partisan crowd
gave a standing ovatIOn to both the IlTlan
speakers, who explOited the Situation fully
The notable speakers were Rekha Shetty of
Stella Mans (who won the tlurd pnze) and
Mltrakuman of Law (who didn't). T Natnan
found qUite a few of the audience gaspmg In
dlSbebef, wlule Mahesh Kumar Khemka
WIth hIS eloquence (and htstnoDlcs), wo~
the First PrIZe.
German RecitatioD
There were movies srheduled to be held at
CLT, and then there was thIS German
ReCItatIOn competition, Judged by Mrs
DaVid among others All the WISe guys
mtroduced themselves and the toPICS In
German, so that we didn't know whether they
were spoutlDg Goethe or Brecht HlStflonlC
~Ide~ffects were marked In some of the recitatiOns, and some said 'danke schoen' sweetly
Well, for the fifty odd IITlans who attended
tlus function, It was hardly entertaining, but
they were thnlled to the roots of thelT hairs
when Sunder Kumar, an IlTlan, won th;
trophy for us. Two Loyola entrants got the
second and third pnzes respectively

Open Group Discussion
ThiS was yet another dlSappOlntmg Item In
the week's programme Well-rehearsed play
acting does not really stimulate Group DlscusSIOD, and that was why It turned out to be
such a farce The College of Engmeenng,
GUlndy, won the first pnze, the mam factors
bemg their leader and an adequate number of
PJs The rest was nothmg to write home
about
Quiz
The qwz was a heart-rendmg affair, It's time
people learnt to be ethIcal and well-mannered
Abusmg of partiCIpants IS not exactly what
the crowd wants to see, and moreover, It IS not
m good taste. V1Jayalatha Reddy, of wce,
won the first pnze wce carted home the
trophy as well.

EDtertaimnent
EntertalJUnent was such a big affair, and
a lousy one at that, that one can mention only
a few Dames and Colleges whIch rOSe up
to the mark Only the last of the four days
prOVided tolerable fare AC Tech came on
strong With Bharghav Mehta and the Moghuls
Loyola had an okay group playmg bubblegum
And Christian, Without Ambl Harsha. put
up a few skits, sang a few songs and m
general, kept the audience m good hum~ur
But that was not enough to retam the trophy
S lET College, In the tradition of Usha
NataraJan, had charmmg Hemalata Subramamam as MC and she proved to be as good
as her predecessor They danced and did
a whole plle of funny thmgs on stage and
walked away Wlth the Entertamment Trophy
The Valedictory function was addressed by
Dr Chandran Devanesen
