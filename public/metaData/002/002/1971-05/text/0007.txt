ThiS old man, he plays three, he

The thIrd part of the study was the flame

forc<!d to leap through a loop of tJr(. whde the

The final and most crUCial stage was the
fifth test called the absolute moment of muscular merha The human was kept under

underwent a rlgorous examInatIon Next, the
variOUS scattered portion., of hIS anatomy were
pIeced together at random under ultra-violet

When
the specimen was fully awakened, he was
dehvered to the reserve cell for further

This old man, he plays hell, he
plays havoc very well
Throughout the course of these experimental tests, the professor was the preSiding
officer However, he never mdulged m domlneermg taCtiCS, hke snadmg, to shake hiS
human subject to the roots of theIr vertebrae
On the contrary, he would squat on hIS
haunches formally and gnn at the grtmaclOg

were hiS diabolIcal eff'orts that he was moved

been regarded solely as domestic pets and
