CARICATURE

I confess, at the outset, that J am somewhat at 0. 10,," for words Tills IS, to be
sure, wholly puzzling There aren'c many
m thiS Institute wh6 know Navz as "ell as
I do. Maybe that's the trouble I know
too much about him so n'l> a trymg exercise
to decide where to start (Not to \\-orry,
No.vz Albeit no holds barred In this column,
thiS guy am't no stool pigeon squealer, )our
dem tootm So I am not on the verge of
splllmg the beans, If that's "hat you are
thml..lng)
First the man Who IS he??? He IS thIS
tall fair, loose-limbed loose-Jomted, looseshlrted,loose shoed young man, mild of manners
dIScreet of tongue, not to mention stiff of upper
lip and noble of nose That IS Navz In a
• broad nutshell'
As for Ius face, not ha\ mg seen lum for
two months makes me pretty uneertam as to
the position tbere In the four odd years
I'\e kno"n Navz. I've seen hIm With Sideburns \\ Ithout them ,nth them agarn
Meanwhue he has combed hiS hair straight
forwards, straIght backwards, straight up
Apart from thiS he wcars a beard occasIOnally
I'll say one thing for thiS boy Variety IS the
Spice of ius life (More SPiCY Sotuff on thiS
later on)
Navz halls from Lovedale In the NJlgrrJs
He also comes from there When he does,
after the hohdays, one IS generally struck by
the clear eye, the r~y pInk compleXIOn and
the cold nose complcte With packed-frame
Wluch he dlsplavs to lus full advantage
But come a coupla weeks and the above
youth undergoes a phenomenal trans{Ol1ll8bon. Gone IS the veneer of prospenty

The eye, once clear, lind the rosy pmk
comp!txlon, IS rcplaced by deathly pallor.
the weU-p'lck~d frame, It has a
tendency to lInpa~k Itsl'lf Towards the
end of the semester, Nav? can hardly walk
011 the streets Without the rIsk ot being
packed up on v1grancy charge.
Nav? IS 'I versatile guy With many Interests
Hors~s and Aeroplanes occupy qUite II chunk
of hlb time The latter especially, he takes
most seriously Life at lIT \\ouldn't be
complete III the evenmgs Without the familiar
Sight and sound of Nay..! carcIlng the hostels,
tenms COllrts etc gentrally glVmg himself a
feehng of supenoflty 10 the prOCt-5S OccaslOnally, he takes a passenger along With him
on hiS route~, normally a girl When you
Jire where eagles dare, do as the eagles do,
IS the maxim
Once I managed to bum a
nde from him and that would count as the
most unforgettable expenence of my hfe
Suffice It to say that I left my stomach and
my nose somewhere up In the eternal blue
Navz's ambition IS to become a commerCial
pilot OccaSIOnally, however, he gets madcap Ideas such as domg IllS doctorate studies
m Aeronautu;al Englneermg, but they don't
generally last long He takes hiS flymg 1fl
deadly earnest. 'It's my profeSSion, yar,'
he says, leavJng you With the feehng that
you should be devoting more time to your
branch subjects
Regardmg hIS domg With guls (the opposite
sex, yetI) Navz IS generally brtef (rarely exceedmg a month) and to the pomt However,
hke all strong men he has hiS weak moments
and IS sometimes swept off hiS feet and Sits
gatherml; clouds for months after. ThiS

generally happens at the rate of once per
annum
However, don't let that fool you, the
shaggy exterior that he gent-rally \\cars Nav?
has certain qualJtles that st-parate him from
the common rut Among theSt- arc a doggedne3S of purpose and a umque penchant for
gettmg what he wants through the eaSiest
posslbk means. The lad has a bright future,
shady past notwithstanding
Navz s mterest III politics was handled
last year after the Carmval Word went
around In the hostels, • Nan IS the man for
G Sec post' 'That's hIm tottering over
there, the future G Sec' And sure enough.
the vOIce of the people didn't go unheard
and Navz made It to the celebrated chair
With no major mishap And he's done a
damn good Job of It No small thanks to
him fOf makmg the Inter-lIT Meet the
roarmg success It was No caricature on
Navz would be complete WIthout a mention
of hiS Alrforce rna-bIke which 19 a cancature

square wheels by the stone age fore-runner
of Henry Ford m one of hIS less creattve
moments Next time you see Ramesh Pal
on Navz's pIllion, observe him carefully and
you will see that he's actually holdmg all
the parts together But, techmcal IffipoSSlblhty though It may seem, It moves all right
Just about
Nav..! IS a class by himself Exactly what
class, the reader IS left to deCIde One thmg
I know It wIll be sad to see hun go

Horror Storg or WOI£h Out,

(ThiS sorta thmg, however, IS only to be
expected in a society wluch equates money to
respect and therefore conSIders the lecturers
Its servants and outcasts. In other countries,
the professor and the academiCian stand at the
helm of SOCial respect and regard scale, and
so there IS an mcentlve for bright young
graduates to start teacl.mg m UmverSJt!es
Here, on the other hand, only those guys
who have been rejected by mdustry step IIlto
the lecturmg lIne. Increase the salary of a
lecturer to about a thousand a month and the
academiC atmosphere will definitely Improve.)
These 3re no more than the rattlmg of chams
or the tapping of ghostly footsteps The real
horror part comes next
Havmg realized that he IS mtellectually
supenor to the estabhshment, Our hero turns to
lus fellow students, only to find that a decld·
lDg maJonty of these young men, the cream
of the country and so forth are lIttle lambs
who follow Mary, or the Great Grade Goddess wherever she may go In extreme cases,
which nevertheless eXIst, they are sycophants
who prostItute their mmds by bnbang the
lecturer With extra respect and other pleasmg
mindless thmgs Those rcmammg prefer to
emasculate themselves by tnakmg use of thell'
admittedly extraordmary ablhty to stare at a
pruned page and reproduce It verbatim a few
days later Apart from Sears and Piskunov
they read nothmg else Those among them
who get high grades have no outSide mte-

rests, no pomts of View, no mkhng that there
eXIsts outside the waH of theIr clOister a
wonderful world of hterature and, more Important, a country whIch desperately lacks a
corps of mtellectuals These mtellectual
zeros, then, by a process akm to mductlon,
endeavour to emasculate our poor hero too
If he does take all the precautions, he
escapes to find that he cannot exISt
m thiS country, no mOre than a harem
attendant can bve outside the harem, and )s
therefore, bitten by Bacillus Arnencanus and
em planes for Yankee-land, leavmg behmd an
army of you-know-who's to take care of the
SovereIgn Democratic Republtc of India.
The leadership, the mtellIgentsla, the sClentliic
mfra-structure that thiS country so badly
needs, IS therefore demed to It and It falls
easy prey to the first gentleman who has the
ablhty to fool a lot of people, or to the first
foreign country that IS suffiCiently mterested
10 takmg over, the net result IS anarchy,
chaos and destruction
And so, the chams have rattled and gone
The last nads have been driven anto the
coffin The monsters have clatmed their
vIctimS and the vlcUm (Ha, Ha, fooled ya)
1S not the hero but the hero's country.
What do we do about It ~ Don t ask me,
boys_ I am't got nothmg that Will help

As the utle mdtcates, tlus IS a horror story
The vrllams here, are not, ho\\ever, made
of ectoplasm and do not resIde m coffins.
They are of flesh and blood and they hve m
colleges, UlllverSltJes and other InstltutlOns of
learrung For convemence, the story IS set m
our own little Institute The hero IS a gent
who has Just left school and has entered thlS
hell-hole.
He Joms With VISions of bramy Professors
expoundmg on relatlVlty. and long hrurs
diScussmg Smayavsky or Rand It doesn't
take long, however, for hun to reahze that
thmgs are not as they should be The first
famt mklmg that tlungs are not nght comes
from the architecture around the JOint There
must be something wrong, he concludes, With
people who design and authonze the construc~
lion of massive cubes and cubOids whose
heavy hOrizontal hnes seem to stIfle all
ortgmality, all fresh-thinking and contam Ius
=gmatlOn m a shell of concrete However,
tlus IS not a major fear and he dispels tills
WJth a wlustle or whatever else people do
when they pass a graveyard at mgat
Next, he finds that most of the Departments are full of Lecturers and ASSistant
Professors, who, It IS clear, know nothing of
the subjects In wroeh they are supposed to
have got Ph Ds. and the hke Here, one
earnest gentleman declares that a ball thrown
on an mcJmed wall at a certam angle wzll
bounce to the tip of the ",all, there another
gentleman asserts \\lth great SIncerity that I
IS equal to ER and procet-ds to prove It
(In
other Colleges, there eXist savants of hterature
who have not heard of Mader, Rohert Lowell
or Grass and wouldn't know what to make of
thelf works If they saw them ThIS may
seem surprlSmg, until one realJzes that m thiS
country, Ph Ds are awarded to people who
have done nothmg but rearrange the standard
phYSical tables. I could go on for pages on thiS
subject but there Isn't any real need to do so.

As for

SRI

I send my best Wishes to the SpOTt Festival of the IndIan Institute of Technology It IS an excellent Idea, I think, thatthe IlT, which IS so famous as a centre of
technological studies of every kmd, the sport 15 also given a good place So It IS
not only the spmtual, but also the phYSical tramlng, which IS proVIded by the
liT ThiS gives a good harmony to the young students, who get theIr educatIOn at
the lIT And the festival, which IS arranged Ifl honour of the sport, Will be a very
good opportun1ty to further the mterest m sport actlvmes
I Wish the Sport Festival of the lIT a. very good and bright success.
