One can qUlte understand the stand of these
anti heroes Perbap::. the teachers are too
brusque In the world of manners, or they
are understandably smug 111 the academics,

just audIence LIke any conglomeratton of
literates, they have their mtelligent and
mediocre entlues If the eyes of these
mediocre men are geared to read mediocre
stuff wntten by mediocre people, then bnlhance wouldn't get us anywhere And oddly
enough, the mtellectuals are cunously stuck
up, unable to do anything that nught save the
siruatton and reVIve our honour Of course,
apart from the few odd horrors who are
