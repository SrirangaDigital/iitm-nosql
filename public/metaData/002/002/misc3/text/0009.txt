predecessors in office were in their moments of lucidity, when they were not coked to tbe

of teeth, but you are made of better stuff and I'd like to oongratulate you for it.
You have recognized that, when repeated appeals for articles of quality evoke no
response from the ma.1ority on the oampus, an editor concerned about good stuff must turn
to the minority. With an open mind and ruthlessly rejecting all the prejudices stutfed
into him from birth about the intellectual and literary abilities of animals. \s a result

elephants wield a pretty effective pen, and in printing their ',ery articulate protest
against all the insults they have had to endUre, you have put life into me just when I was
about ready to die of despair and boredom. I am deeply p,ratetul to you tor it.
Might I suggest that you make it a policy for the future, to boot in the butt all

animals as those elephants? This way at least we shall probably have better tare than
we have had in years. and I for one can begin to shake otf the deeply-ingrained inferiorityoomplex I have developed as a.result of having had nothing but rubbish printed allover
me for as far back into the past as I can recall.

Dear Editor:
This bas to do with the matrimonial advertisement I asked you to oublish for me.
Conaidering the outrageous fee you charged me for it, I cannot say I am pleased witb the
result. In fact, there's been no r~dult; not a single response bas been banded over to me
to date. This is surprisi~ considering circulation of Campastlmes among persons ot .,
11k within the campus. In shJer desperation, seeking some intellectual oompanionship,
I approached the GC elephants, but they said things to my fa~e about it which, had they
been of leaaer bulk, would have reeultea in their extinction. There stands the ma .. ter and

unless your read ern do Rom~thi~ about ~t, I have to reconcile ~8elf to a lonely. meanlnpl ...
existence. I therefore request to moolfy the original advertisement which went "caste, a~.
