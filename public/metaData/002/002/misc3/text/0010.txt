Dear Editor.
As usual,. in the "..ast iSBue of Campast1mes, there was little A tutt from th6 .tat~t
understandably so, 1 considering
the seve~e academic burden they c"e l~bourina
uldor , whioh ,
1
''C
I am t8ld, l6~ve'/rAS~ lor literary expoeitior~ of any kind. Prom whatever they have
condescended to write, I teel that the Bole purpose ot their contr~bution8 is to display
their symbols of erudition. Granted th~t they have worked themselves t~ sbadowL, ar 18
apparent, while earning :heir respective doctorates, but whey tl~unt them? Such pr~·lxe8
do not appear 1n technical journals; then why should th~y 1n so-oa11ed l~ormal rags? Have
they sunk to the levels of our eminent politicians with thej~ 'hon~rary' de~eeA, ~r ia it
ea.pastimes which insists on appending these titles?
In sharp contrast, thankfully. the student contributors weren't Mr. So and so or
Mr.Such and such. This extreme step in prudery, as far as student-run rags are c~oerned,
is whpt only FOCUS is capabl~ of taking. The 'Quark' special whose con+6nte included
Mr. Dilip's gripping ~aga of the cosmetics. made copious allusions to a.l elllsive l'1r.Aia,:a1e
and the zealous Mr • Dimp13 and Raju. If they think that tt3y are being gentlemanly, l~~
me hasten to as~ure them that they are only being silly.
Before 1 conclude, I would like to raise a fur.damental question: What i~ tbe reaso~
for the existence of Campastimes? ,Ostensibly, it is for providing an equal o'1oortunity
for every person in our community to make his or ber iiterary talents known. While the
females, in all their modesty, seem to have hidden the~r talents well and the staff mainly
confine thellJBelves to writing meaningless, modern 'poetry', I Bee that most of the pages
are filled up by the members of your editorial boaru, under thp.ir various pseudonyms.
Do we bave to run a mag for the benefit of a few?

My bri~f encounter with I.I.T. has introduced me to fresh. young minds eager to explore,
j~ded minds disillusioned wlth the lIT phenomenon, overloaded academtc pills to be 8wallowe~.
streaAS of talent, lovely lush green avenues, jaundi~ed buildings, wee~ly assignments 1n
the form of an O.A.T film, the Mardi-grashangover and the nerve raoklnr, task of t~~ch1ng
minds which are very sharp.
Being new to lIT Mad~as and a psychologist, with psychology ~lalmlng a break throu~h
in the dynamic and least understood world of human "'elations, I was asked to bf' object he,
unbiased and p,ive a insight into what I thought was wrong or rather what was not r1gh~
in this place. I perceived disgruntled students, their higb frenzied activity before the
operlos, the often dazed look on their faces on the al.uiomated tour from one clal'ls to anf"ther
and I really wondered if this was cha .... acteristic vf most institl'tions. :erbal encounters
with tbe stUdents lead to an array of responses, aome of ~hich I think wov'a be relevant here.
One of the most common out bursts I encountered was an overw~elming sense of dir'ap,;,!ointment
which the students revealed. This feelin~, they argued, had been generated utter a few "aekA
exposure to the lIT environmer~. Were the~r expecting Bomethinf out of the wclrld? Hnd the"
entered with a rOBY vis 101' of benevolent teachers, Interestinr" eX<' ji; ing elassf>s. a c: 'mmuni ty
exiBt>~re full of interaction and harmony, ~tc. etc.?
May be they ha~ or may be th~y felt
that the name of lIT connote- all these symptoms. Yet if they are so d11apnointad. then
hc'" is 1 t that cutsiders get suoh a posit-ve ideA. of the wvnderful things hf'ppeni g here.
We in the outside world felt that there was A.n input of brilliance here, which undcrweJ1t
a great metamorphosis al.J errerged as an output 01 greater r.rilUlnre and calcul'tted. der~ned
