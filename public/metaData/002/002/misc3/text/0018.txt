Pontification is probabiy a sin; bopetully, a minor one in the sense that it is venial
and not venal. The beaut~· of it is that everyone condemns it in no uncertain terms but
commit, it at the earliest opportunity. Perhaps that is what makes us human.
I recall a saying from the past: ~ un1veLslty is a collection of books'. It you '8et
through' the metaphor, a university is a corporate body of scholars whose pursuit of learning
is a kind of ~ooperative enterprise. While e~ch may pursue learning in his own way, each
is a member of the community of scholars. A community implies a sense of belonging together
ao well as an ethos of communicatipn. It also has, presumably, a Bet of shared values.

As a rule, mos"c IITians, it seems to me, shy away from the books of a general nature with some exceptiOns as usual. You don't nee1 however, more than your fingers to count tbo~e
exceptions (which, incidentally, in my view, prove the rule more about the mastera than
about the uisciples).' O! course, youngsters have more time for general reading than -the
elders" can spare; and that 1s that.
I wish Bomeone from the Department of Humanities and Social Sciences would conduct a
sooial survey to test the purely impressionistic generalisations, a13ve. They survey should
also reveal the literary taste and judgme~t of an average reading Iitian. To hazard a

the distinguished Extra-mural Speaker mistakes us for the "elite W and "the cream' ot the

C.P. Snow, a physicist who turned novelist, tries to bridge the gap between the fttwo oulture. w

For, -man does not live by bread alone". That is precisely w~ he should endeavour to develop

Some yearr ago, an average IITia~ was intellectually a. cut above the rest. With the
paBsage of time~ there has been a general deterioration in our students' ability to wield
the pen for creattve or even functional purposes. Not many seem to ca~e about their verbal
ability, which is a pity, because it 1& gaining enormous importance 1n all professions.
