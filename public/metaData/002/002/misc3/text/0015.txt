So r 'b'!Oome a Professol' end yl"'U a studen1 for tne sole punose cf perpetua t.iDl:
this diohotomv in the Indian society. I thtnk this is whd~e lie our confusions and
failures and in the end this society ~'ilJ lead to oontradiction and ultimately disQat_r.

4. Was it to attempt to :ectify this that you are retJrned to India?
1a
p ~I
A- No, I don't think I have come to rectify anything at all except probably a sma' 1
role in generating basic knowledge and bringing a new th~nking among youn~ people.
I think if there is a salvation for this country, it will lave to come from th~
~oung people.
They have to realise their role in revolutf~nising
the
90rroded and rotten structure that exists in society. ~ ~nstitutions - edocational,
economic, government and soc_al - are good for a muae~m, they have no p1~e n the
face of the problem we have and the fut~e we rant to design. The t'\sk is la.mmotb a""
must mobilise our resources and people, particuarly younr people, i~ giving a new
direction to £ociety rather than being a victim to corrupt politicians, el~tist
educatio..istd, ignorant parents and religious leaders., The wbole thi.ng is sick,
it's a sickness in which we're living.

5. Should we then inculcate a different value system in yLungsters?
A- Ahsolutely - The new values we need are those of inte11ectua. exploration, creativit~
cballenge to a~thority, elimination of elitist ir~titutions a~d we must bring
education down to the street-corn~r, homes and towns so that all educatio~ is part of
a total social development. A student cannot laolate himself tnto thes~ pyramids
which exist away from the r~l SOCiety and its problem. Real eduoatiOll system have
to be in harmony with
B~oial ~thos.
That's not happenirg today. Scudents today want
to go into the employment market and let the quickest possible return for tle money
spent, though most of this money came from the sC'ciety at 4the cost of' millions of 'Poor
people. But I suppose the events will catch up. Those, who 8.l. e thrown on the wayside, for
'.. fle ben.tit of a ~c.w people are one day going to rebel against this system.
6. Do you think we made a mistake after Independen~e 1n neglecting the rural p(~ple
and going in for massive i~ldustr1alisation of the urban areas which only benefited a tew?
A The villages, actual1t were made the dumps of Indian failures an~ all investment was
IIItde in urban areas. The cities today are the reflection of tbis same kind ot
divisiveness - half the people .living in subhuman, animal conditions and a few people
getting all the benefits. I tLinko~4ndustr1al plans, as they wore developed, were
totally wrong in terms of the needs and requireme~tB of the country a'thou~h T am not
a Gandhian, and I do not (~cept Gandhi's ideas of cottage industries. My concetn
is to have such a pattern that enables us to integrate tbe rural and urban ~owth
together. You cannot stop people from bee Omil.g urban anymore, people want to
obtain the effects of the latest tec~nology.
7. How relevant is modern technology t~ India? TS setting up of high technological
centres, even IIT'~ a ]·txury when the benefi 1-s of thee'! do not di~fus_ to all but
received. only by a few?
A- I think What you point out 1s very true. We bave developed an elitist technology
in this country and that includes elitist ,'alues. And I think, tech'lology 1"'\ th1r
country 1s highly selective ':n its overaP. purpose. We know whom we want to serve.
We invest plan, develop according to that purpose mid as far as thu waSSqS are
ocncerned, you are as obliviotJ as I am. If 10,000 children in the slums would 41.
in the next one month, T don't think yvu orl an~or~ ~ho is a Den~fic_ary ot this
glamourou~ technology would care.
We may ahed a cou~le ~f tears when we se~ it o~ a
