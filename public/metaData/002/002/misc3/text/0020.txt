y u liberally quote Gal1ilhi anJ Nehru. How do you reconClle Marx1.sm and Ganr1~19m'!

c: What are your comments cl.bout the blinding cases of B1l1al? Was it d. case of the po:lc~
overreacting or was it a Case of the law not enforcing itself properly?
K: No. There's a lot to be said beyond what appears on the durfac6. What the policemen
did is barbac1tol. At the same time the legal system, .in a wider sense tnc1uding the
1nves~igative machinery, is the villain of the piece.
What the pe~pl~ found was that the
investigations were dilatory. You never get at the m"n. 'if you do get at the man, t:,e
court says the identification is not complete, th1~ is not right, that is not right, the
tprobability is not there, acquit! So, the villagersfLld .;he really guilty people never
get p~nlphed. So it is much bJtter that we author1se the nollce to finish off the fellows
and when the polic~men do th1~, some people striek. The people say I 'they ha.ve done what
we wanted them to dO". That's why this fantastic ~henomenon, nomething scandalising,
~f the Bar ~BBociation of Bhagalpur and th~ people of Bhagalpur oupport1ne the policemen
in their act of blinding. We have to find out why the pathology of the pl~e is 1 ike thi.J.
There you come up against the invest~3ative machinery, the defects in thr judicial system.
i'he Court", going on fir.d.ing a little benefit of doubt here, a little benefit of dou"'t th,,"'e
and acquitting everywhere. I've condemned it myself. W}-3.t iF ilo that these people are
doing? Say, 10 guilty men ma3 be set free, 1 innocent man Lay not be punished. I've asked
them to multiply the arithmetic.
1000 guilty men may be set free, 1 innoc~nt man
may not be punished. If million guilty men may be set free, one innocent man may not be
punished. Tbis extreme susceptibil~ty for one i~~ucent man aMong the million guilty men,
prove& an instrumentality of the jud"cial system which assures t'lat all guilty m"n
may be abroad again, ~d this is destructive of the faith of the people in the justice Byst~m.
i'his is partly indicated in the Bhagalp"r incident.
CI Then do yuu suggest that the Court take chanc~s ·. . 1th passing judgements?
K~
Surely! Ab~urldl If I shoot you here and then the judges say, "This man is intp.rested
in him, that man is interest d in him. So, I'll not do this". All this scale-pan ouslne9s1
There Is commonsensel The judges are not sitting somewhere. They are answ~rable ~o thA
people. T~ey must ensure that the {nlilty men nre LU"'liahed. A ju~~e who runs away from hie
dutyby hiding behind the benefit of the doubt doctrine is certainly no a judge who deRP~P8
to be in of!'ice.
C: Are you sayir? that the judges are not usinp, thpir common~enBe an~ are tr.rin~ to
go strictly by the law?
Ks No, no, no. They are not going strictly by the law. They are ma~in~ an dSS of th,
law. Not all, but some.'
as Would you say that we should have some innocent -peonle punished rather than acOlJ!t ••••
K: No, no, no. Not that innocent peo"Ple should be "PuniAhed, but if an innocent man, hy ~
stray chance, get punished - even now, they are be!n" nunished. So many n,.~ple are in 19.11,
{In'.t you know, with all this weip:hing ",1 th the sCal.e nans" So, the poi~t 1s that t" ere

a ~ C0mi'1g to the moral s1 ~ e of it, do you thinlc that SOMe of us have the 't"lR'ht tl"' l);Hl"
