~ late readera might have notioed that there has been a proll~eratlon I')~ Int.el
articles, poems etc. in Campastimes. Readers reaotion haa bepn rathpr mixed. While t'u'!
so-called Intels have varied appreciation, the anti-Intels have exp~e8sed Indlpnatio~.
The spate of letters on tbjs subject has oau8e~ such wideBn~ead oonsternation that we
dacid·ed to set up a comnission (a la allah Comnission) to conduct a statietical sUl"Vey
of reaction to Intel literature. A three man (Women's ~ib please note) squad promntly
swung into action. Understandably, they had to tread Warily for :rear of aggra~ating the
delicate stat€ of balance. The probe by our auperslutns unearthed some startling
revelations. We publish below that we could gather from the scores of interviews we
conducted with Intels, anti-intels and that ubiquitous IITian - the stoic indifferentals.
The very first issue was - 'what exactly co~titutes an Intel article?' Readers
opinion on this was nowhere near unanimou~. Here is a random sample.

One prominent Intel a (names have been suppressed) 'It can be anything - anything
that defies the structure, t~e trite pretentious compositions' and he lapsed into a
series of worda like dialectic, ecclesiastic etc. which went overhead. An UD8parf~
anti-intel WaS more oonotse. Intel is anything that doesn« t make sans e. Preferably
one line should have no connection with its predec essor or sucessor. After reading
the article one should bave absolutely no idea what it's all abo~t. Someone suggested
that Intel poems oould be generated by a oomputer provided with a list of hlghsoundlng
worde and a string of punctuation marks. The programme, be aaid, would be simply to
soramble them in random raB~. Some intels, elated at the revival of poems of their
genre in Campastimee talked about their sources of inspiration - Kafka, Camus.
Vonnegut (this in hushed reverent tones). Tbey went into raptures over the Ca mpast1mes

They acknowledged that the Bame author's
second poem was even '1ntellar ' and had gone right above their heads. One
particulerly virulent anti-intel attacked the af~rementioned poem as the Produot ot a
depraved soul. We, (after reading it several times) were t·o. duuitounded to disagree
