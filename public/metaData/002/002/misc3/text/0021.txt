MY ORISIS

What "'ae really meant was the unified or dualistio n \tul"e of "matter' I . Wf!' are laml11ar

manifestations in the "spiritual" dimensions. If I may coin a term, the stuff of the univof')'ne
may be called' 'souliclq' '- combining the spiritual and material aspects. Just CIS an electro'"
manu'ests as a particle or vlave de ~ending on the conditions of observation, 80 does the soul,klp
manifest its "material" aspects to the scientistand its "spiritual" aspects to those so
inclined. We have not yet developed the precise language or tequations' to describe the lat' _r
aspect (with apologies to ~stics of both the western and eastern variety), though we have m d~
considerable progress with regard to the former.
As a teacher of quan~um mechanics I often experience the considerable intellectual ~a.~Ie.
that students h~ve to overcome in the transformation of their thinking and their language t~n~
classical physics to quantum mechanics. We are now faced with a greater intellectual-cumSvirltual-cum-Ilnguistic cballenge in progressing from the purely "material" or purely
, spiritual" 1 ,vels to the higher plane where these two aspects are synthesisC',].
That really is my crisis, where eVL~ ~he language of poetry Is ineffective. The best !
can do is to juxtapose the "classic~l" images of human emotions against its "molecular"
counterparts. There is no attempt at 'reducing' the former to the latter. Rather my aim is
to show its duali ty. ~/ho lmows, may be the first rain drop really loves the parched earth and
its tremor has the same characteristics or • 'frequencies' , as those of the quivering lips of the
lovers, as those of the affinities of atoms that bind themselves into molecules. These
soulicles may have the same kind of interactions. When we can tune our "intellectual'soul"
(no contradiction, mind yo'" to these frequenCies, we shall have music. To quote from an early
poem of mine,
~1menFJ1ons

• 'We shall have
music of the tender moon
delivered by the clcuds •
•• • • • music of the children's smile
••••• music of the undulating hips
.0, •• mus ic of the restless electrons,
and 0: the insatiable elements combining
recombining •••••
music of the r~thmic planets.
We shall have an orchestra
by Einstein, Freud and my Grandma
who told such nice bedtime stories.
We shall have music
upon the rockets, under the microscopes
and then upon our souls".
We have not yet found the "irreduci bIen' of the tota.li ty of human experience, noiJ even
of the wavicles as the current sorry stage of particle physics shows. May be we never will.
But the search is exciting and even inescapable for the "intellectual soul".
