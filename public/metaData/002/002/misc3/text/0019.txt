Sorretime bAck a minister said thatl) 600 million people want., law but two judgps
strike it down.Wha . . do you think of this?
1CR lSHNA. IYER: I dnn' t t'1lnR: 'tlla t .11'1 a. propel" perspective there carl be a c onf lic t- between the
executive and the judiclary. It is true that certain orders made by the e.cecutives. why, ~tjrta.n
legislation made by the legislatures have betn struck down by the jud cl~y because the touch
st'1ne that the judiciary adopts is the constitution and it isn't what pleases t' e politi<'al
party in power or for that matter the political party in the opposition.
0: But you do admit that there is a coni'lict now?
K: Whb.t conf lict? Il'here is no eontlict.
C: There 1s one, at least b-r what the politicians have been saying, by what we read in the
papers. Every politician has been trying to make it out that he w~nts to do good for the
country but th~ judiciary is tryi~ to block him.
K: I have been saying the other thing. We want \'0 do good for the country bu t the f''{ecut ive
has not been allowinr us.
C: So it turns out tnat there is a'cor~lict.
K: 1'here is no cpnflict!
0: At hast during the period of the emergency, the period bei.'ore the emergency and after
the emergency the contours of this conflict have become very clear.
Is This is a misapprehension altogether. It is ignorance to think that there is any conflict.
Really there lS no conflict. Any executive authority will tell vou 11'1 can paso orders only
wi thin the parameters of the const! tut"' on" • If any welfare legisldtion has been s . . ruc1{ do",n
by tl.,~ judie iary, a new law must be made within the l1mi ts of the C onat! tut ion. Thia car be
as effective and the constitution provider enough room for passing welf~re legiRlution.
Ot No Sir, th e queS tlon iss Isn't there a t,~ntiency fo the exe~llti ve to aas ume a 10t of
pO\.er and a tend mcy to blame +:he judiciary when it tries to curtd.il this po\'Ier?
X: No TOOre than the studenlls Lave t'1e power to cO"lplain about the terlchers ,md the tea.chers
abou ... the students.
0: So, you say that this is normal of any country.
K: Yes! In any country, this happens.
C: What about this talk of a committed judiciary?
K: JUdges must be committed and noi comrlitted. The;,y must be committed to the const.1tution
anJ the country and not c ornmi tted 0 any p~rty or pera"n.
rf:
L'he executive, in a \'Iay, by what we Imvw of the appointment and transfer of ;:udges hol~s
a certain amount of authority over the judiciary. So, in this way, can t t .1uoltea be influ~nced?
K: Judges are apPOinted not (nly by the executive but alao in cone' 1 (;ation wi th the Ch I ~f
J\lEl tice. Hardly one or two juc1~es in the enti 1'e thirty years of history of' this country - ave
been appoltlted contrary to the wishes of the Chinf .Justice. It 1s a hoax and S\ total
misapPrehension and a false propaganda t.o think t"IUt th~ executive is appointing .1Urlges I'}f
it .. own choice. It's not.
C: Wh?t about the supersession of the ~udges?
T~: ~io, no. Don't run away ;rom one question to another.
Let me clear thir. So far there
has been no "ase, perhaps one or t,·o c .... 3es, whe ... e any judre has been appo~ nted to any court
in this country in opposit i on to the wishes of the Chief ,TustilJ e
Tndir. ThiA is v.:r"
important.
.
0: Sir, but thi~ 1s aloo relevant.
K: Which?
0: That judges have been su erceded.
K: Once in the history of ~hiB count -y.
0: No, J.. t has tnp pened twic e. In 171 ala 0 1 + happened.
I: Yea. You're correct. In '77 also i t happened.
0, Was it against the wishes of the ('J,ief' ,T'Jstice then?
X. Yes. It must have been. (gr~IBin~ly)
C: You mean i t "as for political reasons?
K: Yes, It WaB. And, 8 Jmeamcf", pol1tica 1s wholes0rr J.
O. So. you ~ave finally admitted thav the executive haA 8o~e power •••
K:
No, no_ Executive does have power because the oonscitution gives power to t'". exeoutive.
