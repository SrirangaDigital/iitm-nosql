It's true that in college ca~pUBes, only tsolated pockets of literary talent do exist
and the production of a college magazine is all-lays p1af,'uea by probleulS. One' ound ~t L ... udablt'l
that 1n attempt was mpde +0 bring together the amateur Bcribes from different colleges and
expose them to different 1'acets of journalism. It was a p1ea~a "t surprise that with 11 t tll!
~xperience ~nd no encouragement whatsoever, WCC, with the help of the Indian Expres3, had
organized a Journalism Workshop in .the montll of Februflry. It s' ould be ml"'ltioneJ., howevt..t',
that tre organization was slopny.
The workshop was a 1ist.les<J a:ffair throughout. It sputtered and whistled uneasily
tl'-ough th e tortuous passage of a whole week. The partie ipants did savour a few .lew rc ipEH'
during the wo_kshop. But in general, it appbared that they did not evince any r-itica1
"
interest in the intricacies vf journaliscil and were content wita the statue quo. Not much was
ofiered for one to learn and nobody noticed the difference.
A few sessions were meaningful. The talk on 'Photo Journalism' by Mr. P~ghavendra Rao
of the Indiar. Ex!.-ress \.as really instructive though it ....as conducted too T'apidly for one'a
Underljanding. The notice board journalism had ita uses. But the sreci~enB that colleges
came up with were lukewarm, insipid and unimaginative. Mr. l'!itran Devanesan we'3 the tOl'\.hbearer of the 'new' type of journalism which consisted of high speed, jerky, four letter words.
Perhaps he was keen on introducing an Indian version of the 'new' journalism with words like·
'Dis'bo"lm', 'Darnal' etc. But one could certainly make do with cOr"ics for such ghastly sffects.
Some of his own pie~es, however were remarkable for their detail and graphic effects. In
general there was not much vhat a curious partiCipant could know.
The wor~shop ground to a close .... ith a ccmpetitlon being held for the compilation of a
typical campus leaf. It was ironical that two dark horses from Campaptimes r~n out Pasy
winners, because they were cons picuous by their absenc e during the first fO'lr days of the
workshop. APparently th~ workshop seems to have h~d a negative effect on those who pa~t1cir~ted.
The workshop was not without its aftermath and the f{na1e WuS enacted during one ~f
those sultry afternoons when thp. winners were asked to come over to wec ~o pick up the shield.
While they were groping even in clear daylight, trying to spot the organizers, they were
~ummoned to the Principal's room.
They almost recoiled in shock when a fusillade of shots
rang out; the head of wce ticked them off rather hars'11y. She pulled them up for 'lacking'
manners and told them that they should not have entered the premis~g during working hours.
Comipg out dazed, the IITians happened to run into the wce Campus leaf editor. Despite severe
threats from the 'bouncers' outside the Principal's room against talk1nc to any girl, th_y
approached her and related their tale of ter~or. Thereupon, she went in and, apparently,
r~ eived the sa""~ treatment from the peev iSh princ ipa1, but manag~d to elicit pe: D Jsion for
handing out the prizes. An iL )romptu ceremony outside the office saw the matter througll the
p~in~ipa1, naturally, abstaining. A passing crow ~ooked on benignly; it seemed to be tb~
o~y friendly soul in the ca~pUs.
While this is certainly not one's idea of what'b referred to ~ 'bea1thy interaction',
it should be said that 'hospitality' is not one of WCC's strong points. Perhaps hys'eria
cannot help r;peating itself. The stern-f~ced Principal seems tv have a score to settle wluh
ITT in general, bec. a"!Se a couple 0-1' students who had gone \ 'ith the Gerhard Fischer P"lsketball
illv~te had been dealt
with tJ-1e same iron hand. They had been pullec. up for requesting some
girls to lead them to-any of their basketball player~ even as the PrinCipal was ~ooking on
through thn window of her room. Returning crestfallen, they chanced UpOl. ('orne BL playe1"s a:' d.
being quickw1tted, 'handed over the invite, little knowine that the Principal was on to her
wi.dow-peeping act again. A massive summons issued forth~ and the IITians.were shepherded
into those august confines along with t} e plal'crs and flllDdry other stragglers, and this time.
th~ boot was cleL ..:-ly shown.
"I will not allow anybody to talk to any of my girls witho"...; my
Tlarm1SBion", tnundered the PrincipcLl as she .. icked i.ht.: pocr chaps out.
