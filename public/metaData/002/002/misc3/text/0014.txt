1. Could you tell us something about your early education? How did you get to this firld?
A- Barl1er I was educated in Bombay University. Actually I rebelled against the educat1o~
system here and lett only to explore new areas ot study. I went to U. S. and I W'lS
8uc~essively at Yale, New York and Harvard Universities and I pur~ued the study of
environmental sciences. At that time Indians were going in for either Engg. or busil.183
and I w~lted to be in the area where nobody was going. So I did ~ doctorate e~d
worked with the N.Y. city model ~rD~ramme which we call HUDeO in India, and BPI.Then I
did -. asearch all UnJ..versity of Pe'1.nsylvani'l, Stanford Univers~ ty and taught simultal"eously
at N.Y. Un~ 'eratty. Th~n I got an opportunity to set up ~ urban development programmes
in 1974. Originally I wanted to settle in America. However I look it upa~aphallange
to retu-n to India and came bac .....

2. The subject of environmental programme 1s a recent innovation in this country.

What
got you interested in it?
A- Now I feel I'm glad I went into this because I think ultimately tbe fate of man on
this planet will be dete.minef by what he do 9 with his environm~nt. Now all of us
rMognize that we are living in the age of Sciellce and Technology and thl.s 1s not
going to stop - we are going to enter the era of newer autamat!on and so on. T~e
question we must ask 1s this - where is all th1j Sand T tak1ng us? 1 tbink it we tail
to realise that we are total:J integrated with the environment without Which we cannot
survive, we are ~eading for our own doom. Tbis 1s more se~ious in the case of country
llke Tndia.
3. The model planning and procedures that you have adopted in New York and other
places - are they compatible with ~onditions in ~dla?
A- Bo, I don't think they are compatible. Pirat Jf all we have a large rural pap.'at10n
and a small urban popu" ltion. Secondly, our culture is different. Whr ~ you could do
by way of planning in the U.S. you would never apply berf". Tbere the concep ~ ot
planning has shifted from a uni-nucleated city to a multi-nucleated one and the l~rga
uni~ucleated c1 t1es like N. Y. and Ohicf'go are all collapsir,g. So I ";hink we shou]Jt ha" I.}
never 111tl.tated the West in this planning process. We should bav(' had decentralised clHel
whicb are better integrated with the rural environment.
TQd~ we are creating two societies - ~be rural suciety and the ~r~ ~let7.

The
urban sooiety ie an exclusive, elitist society which has no concern for the rest ot the
country. And an educption system 1s built aro~md 'ibat, tITs a'1d Universities are bunt
