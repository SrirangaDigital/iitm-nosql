O. How waR the experience in your oas.1
K. My wife's apjTit oame and spoke to Q friend ot Mine - I won't d1eolon~ hin nam~ _
he's my oo11eaf't~e, a judge of the Supreme Oourt. And the next dllY he verj f'f c~ it Wi tl me,
he as lce~ me - 'Did you do such a thing?"
"How a.re you B,sking thi~ queatil'm" - I a.a).oM lJ 1m.
"Mrs. KriB~ma Iyer came und told X that this bappened".
O's Doesn' t this kind of belief flounder in the fac e of dialectical materialism?
Ka I believe in facts, dialectical or no,o materialism or no
O. Then wh~ about you~ enthusiasm for TM?
KI Because again it 43 scientific. I wish I oould take YQu to the laboratory in Sal7.burp
where you are tested before, dur~ng and after TM. I have myAelf ~on~ throuph the teat.
e: Isn't it es it's preached, practised and propagated now, more of an elitist fancy?
I. It shou~d not be.:lt depends on the common people taking to it.
Os No. The way it is being propaga~ed now.
Xt Then it's the ~~agation you must oppose. I've alwaYA told Maharishi Mahesh lPgi- yo
I t
take this to the masses. I've always talked on platforms where he himself ia sit~ing,
on the people's conseiousness being aroused not the e11te's'ooneciousness. This 'forld's h,',p'throllgh TM is by having entire mankind practise-I TM, not by confjn1ng it to half.~a dozen pf!~'~'lf'l.
CI There are many intellectuals deeply concerned about the country and 1 to rlJ ture •and you
perhaps are one of them. How •••• how sincere do you feel you are? Rather how fully commlttfl('!
to this issue are you •••• to be honest with yourself?
Kt I don't think I'm 100 percent commi~te~. Otherwise I srould go and live in the slums.
I have not identifie1 myself with the people. Therefore I don't pretend.
0: Thank you very mucb (gruff tone). Thank you very much (a squea~ier tone).
