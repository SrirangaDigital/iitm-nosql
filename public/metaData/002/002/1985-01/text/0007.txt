Joy Thdmaa was a rare bird.

A quiet, unassuming guy, he combined

excellence in academics with a high enthusiasm for and remarkable
performances in Institute Cultural Events especially in the Quiz,
Guess-word and Tintoretto.

In the team events, where he combined

with Kovoor, there was none who could hold a candle to him.
Suresh Babu and Nagesh managed to corner him and wangle a brief
interview for CT just before his departure for God's own country.

Joy has some interesting things to say ....

CT

Looking back on your five years here, in what way do you think
IIT has influenced you?

JT

Well,

I enjoyed my stay here.

There has been a tremendous

change in ideas and a considerable expansion in general outlook
since when I entered.

As JEE first,

there was a lot of pressure

on me to produce good academic results .... but I felt that I
could develop a healthy all-round personality by making full
use of the facilities for extrarcurricular activities provided

in the campus.
CT

Don't you feel that students who show real interest in their
work here are becoming more and more rare?

JT

Yeah ... Many students join the course because circumstances
Some of them, I think, will be much better off
force them.

doing theoretical physics, maths etc.
CT

But after B.Tech, one can change one's field.

The reason for

losing interest seems to lie in the way we go about our course
here.
We do many subjects, learn a number of facts without
understanding the proper connections.
Hence, by the end many
of us have a feeling of not having learnt anything substantial.
JT

Quite true.

A proper perspective is lacking.

The courses

here don't go to the depth necessary.
One of my professors
once said that by the end of oneâ€™s Ph.D. in Engg. one may not even
know how a telephone works.
