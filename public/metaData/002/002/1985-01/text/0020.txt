The more cynical say memory is an
imperfect recorder of events.
They
claim it notes down strictly what
it pleases, and often what really
never took place the way memory
tells you it did.
It is, however,
the only way to recollect what
might have happened, to any degree

of accuracy.

So let's take a trip
lane

to when you were

a hesitant, and perhaps somewhat
defiant, newcomer to this Institute
of National Importance (as our
peers deem this Spiller-out of
degree-holders).
You were then made
to believe that you were ’the cream
of the country'
The wise muttered
that it wouldn't take too long for
the cream to turn sour.
'What a
damnable c1iché!', you thought, and
ignored it suitably.
You were told
that you would find opportunities
in plenty - to excel in your chosen
field of academic Specialisation, to
mould yourself into a thinking,
responsible and self-reliant adult,
and to equip yourself to face a
vastly uncertain future.
You'd
made it to I. I. T., and you promised
yourself

enjoyed playing a game or two, you
could sing, or do well on stage.
Maybe you liked helping out with the
organisational work around the campus

or in the hostel.

Of course you

were enthusiastic about your new
interest in the beginning.
Not

wildly enthusiastic, though - oh,
no!
That would never do for the
cool guy image.
And it was then
you encountered the unbudging indifference of the world to you and
your limited interests.
It was a
bitter pill to swallow at first,
but if you didn' t like it you still
had to lump it.
That sealed the lid on your
experiment with non- academic setups.
There were always good times
with the others to fall back on.
They soon staled into notrso- good
times,

Hey!
The lectures at I.I.T.
are supposed to be interesting.
Maybe all of them wouldn't turn out
to be so perfectly rotten . . .
Bloody right!
They mostly turned
out to be a whole lot worse.

On looking around a little, you
