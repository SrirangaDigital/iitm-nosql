This is not

a review on Mrs. Angedance on 27-9-84 in

CLT.
I am not qualified for that,
though I can say that I was keenly
interested, and judging from the
response, many more were fascinated
too.
Perhaps

all

art

forms

can be

clubbed together as modes of
expression.
It is possible that
each art-form develops its own
characteristic features, some
grotesque, some charming, some
somewhere in between.
One can go
the whole hog and say that each
practitioner of

the

selfsame

art

will cultivate his own gimmicks,
idiosyncrasies and mannerisms
which will pass under the more

dignified name of 'style‘.

There

is inherently nothing wrong in this,
as it is consistent with the
premise that art is a mode of
expression.
Expressions, literally facial
expressions, form a major part of
Bharata Natyam.
And it is obvious
how facial expressions possess
different meanings in different
parts

of

the world.

People

shake

their heads in a bewildering
variety of translatory and rotatory
movements to say ’yes’, the world
over.
The same holds for 'no',
and

the crunch comes when one man’s

'yes'

is another's

'no'.

Different

people contract different facial
muscles when they are angry,

frightened, delighted, ecstatic,
indifferent, in love, in hate,
embarrassed or whatever.

Still,

there's a reasonable uniformity in
the facial language used.
Like,

maybe

frightened ape has a grin on his
face.
This became more comprehensive
when I read that the grin has a
diplomatic gesture to show that one
meant no harm.

What is the artist's quest in this

smiling.

Many of you must have

string of ape photographs (I don't
mean the trio of Gandhian monkeys)
showing them in various moods.
