comfortable mattress. Suddenly he
lifted his massive bulk and coming
out, he yelled at the man

'Get out

of here'.
The drunkard stared
uncertainly at him.
'I said get
out of here.
Fight at home if you
want to.
Come here only if you have
business to transact'.
He was not
one to allow a drunkard and his
wife to ruin his days
business.
The drunkard made an obscene
gesture in the fat jewellers
direction. took two steps and fell
on'his face in the dry dust.
With
a patience born out of weariness
and exhaustion, the woman lifted
him to his feet, and slowly transported him to the shade of an old
shop verandah.
She returned to
pick up her fallen cloth bundle.
The fat shopkeeper was still
watching her. his arms folded

snugly over his warm paunch.
She looked at him once. without
hatred, and continued to walk down

the long road home. her head high
and shoulders straight.
It was a
hot afternoon.

£9.
I saw you first
At the pOpcorn stall.
You were hopping mad,
But so darn small.
You were tackling
That packet mighty fast,
And enjoying the treat
To

the

salty

last.

But the man was making
An

awful

racket;

Quite naturally cuz you
Hadn't bought the packet.
But your eyes flared
With battle light
Though you were tiny girl
You made a pretty sight.
He advanced with purpose ~—
His first clenched tight,
My wee dove,
He'd have knocked you outasite.
But

I was

there—-

The knight of the day;
And knew precisely where
My obligations lay.
With rolled up sleeves
I

took up

the

guanlet.

You glanced up in fear

And 'voila' our eyes met.
Your dainty heart thumped,
And

I

felt

you pray.

With a swift fifty paise
I saved the day.
I was big and you small,
I was tall and you round.
But hand in hand,
We stood our ground.
And that was the day
Our marriage was born;
As we shared the popcorn
Corn by

corn.
