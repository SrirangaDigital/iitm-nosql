register on today's public consciousness let me pass on
to other things.
The

cover of

the

last

issue

attracted my

attention,

evoking memories of adventure stories featuring pirate
ships on the Spanish Main.
0n perusing the editorial
I couldn't help chuckling at the nautical confusion
afflicting the editors.
By way of splitting hairs let
me point out that the stately galleon in full sail and
bristling with cannon is of rather recent vintage
compared to the oar-powered sail~assisted galleys of
Phoenician or Roman times.
The 'pretty neat' explanation for the missing cars is misplaced by a few
centuries!
Note the absence of oar-holes as well.
Further criticism can be left to the naval architects.
But for all that, the point made by the editors is well
taken, namely that the ship in question lacks something,
be it rudder, or crew, or passengers, or cargo, or
ballast, or wind, or distination, or aught else I know
not.

Regarding the general complaint of lack of contributions, is it just a matter of available talent being
diffused over too many campus publications?
The logic }
of having three different rags featuring the same kind
of student writing is not evident at least today, whatever their origins might have been.
A lot of effort is
getting duplicated, and even without any first hand
experience I am prepared to believe that bringing out
a paper can be a thankless and frustrating job.
I won't attempt any comparison of Campastimes then
and now.
My memory suggests that the paper in the

60's was more substantial by way of volume and range of
entries.
If there is a complaint today about lack of
student response, necessitating plagiarizing back
issues, what could thepossible reasons be?
-

-

influence of television or video?
emphasis on computer literacy at the expense of
verbal literacy?
preoccupation with the academic rat race?
an increasingly competitive admission procedure
eliminating the traits needed for creative verbal
expression?
apathy traceable to any of the frustrations of
campus life?
a dominance

of

sometimes obscure

campus

humour and

terminology which may put off a prospective writer
not fluent in that kind of lingo?
or a genuine decline in talent (for which I see no
reason)?

he fact that Campastimes published my last piece of
obscurantism is clear evidence of declining standards
in campus journalisnu*
They even went out of their way
to preface it with unfounded aspersions regarding my
past character.
