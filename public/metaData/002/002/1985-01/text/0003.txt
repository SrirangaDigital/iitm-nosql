affairs, that we are not responsible for what follows.
what followed that day wasa display of rocket artillery
to the usual accompaniment of a vocal dysentry of boos
and catcalls.
But there is a limit to these things.
And that limit was crossed when some thickheads sought
to make things hot for the participants by bursting
crackers.
That a few of the saner elements should hold
that the binge ought not to have been held under the
open sky on Diwali Eve with crackers easily available
to the IITian is both unflattering and unfortunate.
Ne earnestly hope that we are sufficiently evolved from
monkeys, not to get unbalanced by sparklers.
Let us in
future try and behave like decent hosts.

We don't know who they are but there are some
optimists out there in the cold who actually believe
that a sizable percentage of the next crop of intellectuals
in the country will be from the IITs.
We may safely
assume that IIT Madras is expected to furnish a fifth

of this quota.
But if the number of relevant articles
received by this mag in the wake of the tumultuous
happenings in the country to-day is any indication of
the concern of an intellectual

for current problems,

then God help the Indian intellectual scene, for the
IIT Madras guys can't.
To be sure, we have a large
number of analysts of the armchair variety.
Their
wisdom can be had for the price of a cup of tea at
Nair's tea shop or Quark.
Talking is one thing.
Writing is something else
again.
Writing on social issues, like writing a computer
program, forces organised thought and man is naturally
more sober and sincere when his word is to be recorded,

for he hardly wishes to appear an unthinking ass to his
readers.
We are there if he does wish to.
So churn out a couple of masterpieces this sem.
Any topic goes.
Remember that this mag doesn't run on
air.
We'll
New Year.
