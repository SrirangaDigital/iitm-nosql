All
through his life - first academic
and then political - he had wished
for a quiet retreat where he would
have all his time and energy for
peaceful contemplation.
His early
dream was to view life from a
distance - not to get involved in
it himself.
He would have been
perfectly content if he could sit
at the top of the highest mountain
on earth and just observe the world.
He was so enchanted by life that he
couldn't afford to miss any single

It
was this interest which had led him
to the study of 'the science and
philosophy of the mind', as he
liked to define his area of work.
He was so happy in the cellar that,
at the end of the first week, he
wrote in his notebook - '1 can live
like this for years, confined to
this room.
My thoughts and my
dreams will keep me company'.
Writing was always a passion with
him.
In the excitement of youth he
had written - 'For me, writing just

It is
like being able to do more than
merely living.

But, it was not long before
he changed that opinion ‘ 'Everytime
I take my pen I do so with the hope
of writing what I always wanted to
write - that something, somewhere
deep in my mind which has been
craving for expression ever since
I thought I could express myself.

something very remote from the actual
thing.
