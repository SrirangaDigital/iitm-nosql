Dan makes a pretty good case for staying away from marriage.
He doesn't
speak from experience, of course, but he alleges that a married man is
nothing but an odd job boy with sex privileges ! That is only one half of the
story.
The other half, dear Sarayu—ites, is upto you to supply ! Let
not this slur on womanhood pass you by ! - Eds.

Men come in two broad classes the marrying sort and the other,
luckier sort.
We have our share of
both.
The marrying chaps are those
guys with sheepish, domesticated
looks.

The next stage reads like a

You

Wouldn't you prefer to spend
