After encountering at least three

about

his antecedents, and what follows
is the result of my investigations
in the library.
Diogenes of Sinope who lived
roughly between 4l0 and 320 BC
was one of the Greek philisophers.
Though he was not the founder of
the 'Cynic' school, he is the best
known anyway,

about

his public nick name was 'the dog'.
In fact the word cynic as we use it
today is derived from the Greek

words 'Kunikos' and 'Kuon' meaning
doglike and dog respectively.
He
went against all social conventions,

leading a vagabond's life and
begging his food.
He is reputed to
have lived in a tub, renouncing
all other material possessions.
It
is said that he owned a mug but
gave it away after observing a boy
drinking from cupped hands.
Diogenes would go about in the
daytime with a lighted lamp,
'looking for an honest man' as he
put it.
Even Alexander the Great
got a dose of his biting sarcasm.
When the great commander asked
Diogenes whether he could do anvthing for him, the Cynic retorted,
'Move aside.
You are blocking my
sunlight.‘
To which Alexander is
supposed to have said, 'If Alexander
