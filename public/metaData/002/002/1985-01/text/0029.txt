1. 15 billion years.
2, Mount Olympus Mons in Mars.
Height = 26 kms.
Base diameter = 550 kms.
3. It is the time taken by the sun-

from the flow of interstellar wind.
8. The bright star, visible even in
day time, that appeared in 1054
was a supernova which occured in

and the rest of the solar system

the constellation of Taurus.
The
force of the explosion caused

to complete one revolution
around the centre of the Milky
Way galaxy and is equal to 250

Presently (as we see it) these

4. In 1968, the radio telescope at
Cambridge, while searching for
radio sources, received regular
pulses of radio noise coming
from a fixed point in space.
The radio pulses were so regular,
that it was thought that they
might be signals from intelligent
beings.
The signals were later
found to be coming from a pulsar
which was named LGMI, short for
Little Green Mass 1.
5. In 1974, humanity announced its

presence to the universe.

Using

as high as 1000 Km/sec.
The
residual star is a fast spinning
neutron star,

this neutron star after the 1054
explosion indicates that this is
a very young n-star.

9. Cygnus-A in the year 1946.
10. Sagittarius.
11. 3 Solar masses.
This limit was
discovered by Oppenhiemer.

the 1000 foot radio telescope at
Arecibo, astronomers beamed a

coded message towards the
Hercules cluster, M13.
Estimated
time of travel : 24000 years
6. Nemesis.

7. The boundary of the solar system
is called the heliopause.
It is
the distance from the sun, where
the outward pressure from the

commonly known as a

pulsar. The time for formation of

Thuban in the constellation of
Draco.
This used to be the pole

star during ancient Egyptian times.
13.

16000 years hence, Vega will
become the Pole star.
A fixed

Pole star is not possible because
of the earth's precession about
its axis of rotation.
