After all, this is a student
paper and only student contributions can keep it alive.
I have
merely phrased some questions,
not expecting any answers but
hoping to generate some thought.
If Some more and varied contributions are not forthcoming
voluntarily, it reduces the incentive for bringing out the

And

at

all.

now for other campus matters.

One aspect of campus life which
jars an old-timer's sensibilities is the amazing plethora of
committees and reports and
counsellors and meetings and
deans and councils and what not
which have spIOUted in the meantime.
There is an impression
created of student involvement in
various matters.

However,

I

student who can ever

get

in here, and the pressures on him
to achieve (by conformity,
obedience

and blind acceptance)

it is impossible for any representatives to organise a
meaningful and concensus approach
to the various issues which come
up, and study all their implications.
My comments are based entirely
on some exchanges which appeared
in Focus and some notices which
caught my attention.
I found it
rather pathetic that student
representatives

should

actually

apologise (A communication gap Focus, Vol 6, No 2) for the lack
of continuity in the the student
response from one year to the
next.
It is understood that the

individual student is present
here

for a limited

time

and

commands limited organisational
facilities, whereas the committee
game is traditionally played byâ€˜

old bands who are experienced in
manipulating things.
The dice
are

thus

loaded

anyway,

my presence here

and any

student representative attempting
to really do justice to his task

being anyway quite

untypical, rather like the quest
described by Phaedrus and quoted
in the last issue of Focus.
Academically, the principal change
between then and now is the increase
in complexity.
I escaped before the
semester system was introduced, and
from what I have seen of the present
conditions, it seems to me that one
semester is not long enough to impart
worthwhile instruction in any subject,
what with the number of tests, exams
and holidays which intervene.
But
maybe no one is interested in what is
actually taught, when the emphasis is
on

grades

and performance.

The

current grading system or systems are

just can't buy the theory that a
nominal student presence at a
meeting makes the student body
at large even marginally responsible for or agreeable to the
decisions taken.

sacrifices.
The Opinion expressed
here is a purely personal impression,

clear

to me,

so I cannot

comment.
If I go on to the subject of the
quality of teaching then and now,
I am obviously treading on dangerous
ground, since most of the faculty
from that era are still around today.
I certainly had many good teachers,
but many more disappointing ones,
considering that I expected a
generally high standard from the IIT.
Unfortunately the quality control
apparatus is only applicable to
student admissions.
I suppose things
are much the same today, there being
no evidence of or any particular
reason for a significant improvement
or decline in teaching standards.
I
cannot resist quoting by name one of
my good teachers, who has long since
left.
The Professor in question was
Dr.-Ing.

W.

Scheer who

taught us

turbomachines around l967.
His
systematic presentation of a rather
complex and diffuse subject was
really creditable.
In spite of his
German-accented not-so-fluent English,

his explanations brought the subject
alive by simply appealing to engineering common sense.

He

spoke with

authority, but devoid of any obscurity,
and I can still recall his beautiful
diagrams on the boardand his actions
and manner of expression.
Such
teachers are rare, and I am grateful
for having
ad at least one.
He
taught me much more than turbomachines,

which is a subject I have had little
