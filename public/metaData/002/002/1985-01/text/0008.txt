How does competition affect or help studies?

JT

After the introduction of relative grading in my batch there
was desperate mugging.
When guys in my batch were in different
parts of the hostel, each guy thought the others were studying
all the time.
Once we moved into the same wing, guys came to
realise that it was not so.
Too much of mugging doesn't help
understanding.
Many students don't know when to stop preparing
for an exam.
They keep on mugging till the last moment, going

"...BY THE END OF ONE'S PH.D. IN ENGG. ONE MAY NOT EVEN KNOW
HOW A TELEPHONE WORKS !"

over the same portions again and again.

Many guys who attend classes say they don't get anything out

of them.

What is your experience regarding this?

JT

There are good teachers and bad teachers.
In the classes I
used to attend, I listened carefully and managed to understand
most of the things in the class itself.
That is how I could
find time for extra-curricular activities.

CT

What do you feel is the reason behind the general decline in

JT

I cannot say what the exact reason is.

But, the decline is

Our seniors were a lot more enthusiastic and

in my first year, CLT used to be full for every event.
Guys
do have a lot of enthu when they come.
Once inside, they seem
to think that only grades matter.
They have to realise that
there are other things which make one a better person than mere
‘grades.,

(CT getting

snooty with JT).

As William James said,

human-

beings tend to live too far within self-imposed limits.
Your
example may help guys see that one doesn't have to sacrifice
extra-curricular activities to do well in academics.
JT

They have to see that what they sacrifice is sometimes more
valuable than what is gained through the sacrifice.

Why do you think guys don't like to Join Indian industry?

JT

We don't come to have any experience of Indian industry.
We
have only a distorted view of our industry.
We only hear of
what is wrong with our industry whereas we don't care to see
whether there is anything wrong with American industry.

CT

Do you feel that our edzuntion can be made more relevant to
the Indian situation ?
