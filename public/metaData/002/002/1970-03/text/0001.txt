It is quite inipossible to think of Dr K\ehl,
and his contribution to the flowermg ,of the
Indo·German Project called'the lIT, Madras
with any sense of detachment." During' th~
last nine', years .. of.. hiS'· assooiation with the
Institute, he has·been an integral,and dynamic
part Qf 'all its activities..:-in its'academic areas,
in'the .extra-curricular domains ~ncompassing
the .Student-community of" the' -Institute and
in' t\le: life -of the Campus: in the social and
artistic ..spheres.
Dr Klein did his Doctoral work in
Germany' at Tuebiiigen on' Indian' philosophy
(tnesls : The;! Advaita Doctrine 'of Redemption
accord·iug to Vidyaranya's Panchadasi).
Subsequently, he carried out studies in India
at Santiniketan and at the Government Sans·
i!i;it Gollege, 'Calcutta' on the Advaita Philo.
sop1;ly "and the.' relati!lnship between the
history'. f the Sringeri Mutt and the foundation' of Yij3.ianagara .. This baCkground gives
Dr KIehl a'v(£ry deep appreciati9n of India's
.intrin~ic culture: It has prQbably enabled ,him
to accept lndian conditions as he found them
anq !19hieve an equanimity, in his approach
to all problems, that often eludcd his colleagues
frOID Geimany. It is also not unusual for
l1im in' dealing with problems that he
-encountered to show a flexibility of mind and
a sensibility tQ pr~vailing ..elwironmcnta~
.conditions and Ilational charl}.ct~ristics. tha,t
his Indian colleagues might envy.
'rhe success of a Project which 'involves
the working together of intellectuals from
two nations is often dependent on whether
:such a Projl!ct is able to acquire a few individuals who can stand apart from the rest
and; by the depth of their understanding of
basic issues, by the charm of their personalities and the spirit' of give-and-take shown by
them, build bridges of understanding across
the gulf of disparities 'which arises from the
-differing national characteristics. Dr Klein
undoubtedly belongs to this class of gifted
individuals and he has made a significant
·contribution to the great success already
.a{'hievcd by this Institute at Madras.
The work of Dr Klein, spread over a
-decade, in establishing, at this Institute
within its'framc-work of daily life. a tradition
based on graciousness,
warm-hearted
humanism, respect for fellowmen and a
love of the good things of life, will be remembered with gratitude and cherished by all those
who knew. him.
On the eve of his leaving the shores of
India to take up in Germany an assignment
which will stilI, happily, continue .to bind him
to this country, I, as one who, had. the privilege
of working with him and coming under the
influence of 'hi~- pel'sonalitj,. salute him as a
cultured citizen of Europe and a good friend
of India. I extend to him my warmest good
wishes for many more radiant years marked
by intellectual vigour, artistic expression and
humanitarian service.
