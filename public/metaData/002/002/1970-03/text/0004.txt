bringing '.some; civilizatioit to our· Campus.
He haslt't .•quite succeeded) but that~s not his
fault. , . In \his; great .. and . glQrious .. task, he
started 'Work on the students (he'knew .tha~, the'
Staff were/lvay.beyond, his. or, anybody e.1se~s
help) and 'kept at it despite the' h'eavy· 'Odds
against him. He tried· advising the -Literary
Commi~tee found that inadequate, and took
-over the -Gymkhana, lock, stock, barrel and'
-death rattle. There, may be, he bit .off more
than he. could chew. but his attempts have
been heroic.
Dr Klein' is an old friend of· Campas...
.times - - it's first 'publisher, and an interest~
-ed'party :ever' since. He 'even ,wrote for
Cam-pastimes (a rare' thing for a Staff· member,
.but then, Dr Klein . was . hardly a 'Staff
member) under. the pen name D. J. Nirmal
(Dishonest John Nirmal - - Heaven knows
'\vhy I). Try a sample of his work: ~ Ye OIde·

,draws .consiaerable. though,· not intense, comp'~tition. 'Allowing for sIiow~balling' in yea~s,
to come, TITians agree thal the-right sort of
idealism can :be vindicated in ·practice. .
Dr Klein· .. roams the Campus and sometimes v'entures outside, it in an' outsize 1908
model GM Pontiac, sedately ·driven for the,
simple ',reason that tue .immodest speeds of,
today are quite beyond the capacities o! the·',
.contraption•. : His bachelor's quarters are full
of antiques, curios, and books about India.,
lIe's a keen collector, which sort of proves
the point' .that :t6 feel itt home amongst
.antiques and ancient relics, one doesn't have
to be one oneself. He classifies himself as a'
humanitarian and smokes VICEROY and
laughs pleasantly at your jokes and his OWn
(he's full of them) and speaks English with a
trace of a weird accent (~ot quite German,
110t quite Indian - - j\1st Kleinian).
We IITians are not very good at Germani
not very civilized inside the Campus or out-

side it, and have a long way to go be'fore we
can consider ourselves even moderately cultured.. But Dr .Nikolaus Klein SUre has helped.
Years hence, when we become recognizably
human, we may be able to say jU'it how far
this humanitarian has been successful in his

worlt, and know just how to thank bim. But
