OPTIMIZATION OF COST IN RESIDENTIAL BUILDINGS - A case study
Mr. S. Rajiv.
Optimising cost in the construction of residential buildings
is essentially a very important topic that civil engineers can

contribute

to a lo: .

It is generall; seen that the enginee—

ring aspects of the construction of residential buildings are
mostly being managed by non technical contractors.

The public

feeling that there is practically engineering

involved in house construction and if any at all the head mason

or the contractor (mostly non—engineer) are more than sufficient for that.

Both in the case of flats as well as bungalow type of
residential buildings,

it seems like the industry has standar—

Architects are being called

These plans may be functionally efficient,

but may not be cost effective.

Also, most of them follow the

conventional technology in construction.

As the factors affecting the cost of construction are
many,

proper thought has to be given to each one of them,

to minimize the cost.

Proper utilization of advancement

oftechnology in planning,

structural forms and their design

and construction techniques will bring down the cost of
construction by a great extent.

I would like to share some

of my thoughts and experiences in this area.

Recently,

about

6 months back, I have completed the construction of my own
house,

where I tried some ideas, which are not generally

practiced here.

The experimemt proved to be successful

so far,

both from the performance of the building and the

costOf

ccnstruction point of view.
