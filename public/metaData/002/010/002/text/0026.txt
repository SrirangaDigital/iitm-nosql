The reason for this wide spread interest is because
of several reasons.

Since the roof is transluscent,

artificial lighting is not required in the daytime.

It

also gives a controlled environment that gives a feeling
of being outdoors - A desirable feature for sport structures
and which cannot be achieved by other structures.

In 1983 Buckminster Fuller proposed another novel
idea - The Tensegrity Dome.

This type of structure doesn't

need air pressurization inside.

This inspired Gieger

Associates to design the Gymnastic Hall for Koream Olympics
with a system very much similar to tensegrity dome â€” Cable
Dome - rivaling low profile air strutrures in Economy and
appearance.
the prv.

(The plan and the truss details are shown in

page).

It is envisioned that the cable Domes will

over the next ten years impact the design of long span
roots, particularly for sports facilities,

as the low

profile air structures have in the last ten.

The development in compression structures will be
always constrained by considerations of buckling which is
controlled by the geometry of cross section.

Freudenthal

and others (in 1950) have shown however that, for a
particular material the modulus of elasticity is a constant,
but on the other hand the ultimate strength can be made
to increase by reducing or idealy eliminating the imperfections in grain boundaries.

We now know that grain

boundaries can be climinated by growing metallic whiskers
in a gravity free environment as in outerspace.

whiskers

These

would have a strength thousands of times

greater than materials now produced on the earth,

Similarly

it is possible to postulate one molecule thick glass
