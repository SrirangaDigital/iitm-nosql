deflections of individual parts because the structure was determinate.

It should be noted that in the case of indetermi-

nate structures,

We can not apply these kinematic Principles.

Due to the presence of reduntant reactions any rotation or

translation would induce forces in the members which would
further

change the deflections.

However it

can be seen that

based on these principles , an exact method of analysis of indeterminate structures could be evolved which does not require the
