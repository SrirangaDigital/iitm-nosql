a proper seating on the joists.

The reinforcement in the joists

is to be designed for its span.

8 mm

HSD bars are used as

main refinforcement and shear connectors are provided projecting
out,

so that the joist acts as a single unit togerther with the

ally.

Hence the mix was prepared manu—

A mason and two helpers took half a day to cast three

shells.

The shells were demoulded on the third day .

After demoulding,

the gunny bag fixed on the mould was

tightened so that next set of shells could be cost.

To have uniformity in the structural forms in the build—
ing,

funicular shells are used as sunshades.

With this,

the

conventional formwork and centering was totally avoided except
for the

staircase. Complete prefabrication of lintel beams

and sunshade units accelerated the speed of construction work,
along with considerable reduction in cost.

The details of a

typical sunshade are shown in figure 4.

Casting of joists,

lintel beams,

parallel

shell units for sunshades and roof were
with the construction of walls.

The

sunshade shells and necessary brackets were ready

after curing by the time the wall construction reached the lint—
el level.

Similarly all the shells and the joists were ready

when the walls reached roof level.

Erection of whole roof syst—

em consisting of joists and the shells was completed in a day.
ﬂThe group of workers were really afraid to walk over the roof
after erection as the body of the shell is only 25 mm thick and
did not have any reinforcement.

It is quite understandable that

they are only used to 100 to 120 mm thick slab with 8 to 10 mm
HSD bars running across as reig;orcement.]
