steel cables as structural elements in a building however,
is very recent.

One example is the tensile root used in

International Agricultural exhibition in Madrid (1953).
Roofing was cable net + light weight concrete.

Water-

fightness was achieved by a tectined cloth, painted with
bitumen applied to the external surface.
painted with aluminium paint.

Exterior was

The root had to be repaired

every two years for impermeability.

But now that the structure could no longer be considered
temporary or portable, what was needed was membrane material
that would allow for the construction of a

Structure'.

'Permanent

Although in 1964 a new membrane material

was introduced - polyester reinforced with plastic fibre it was not entirely satisfactory.

The task was finally

assigned to Gieger Berger Associates (in New York) by
Educational Facilities Laboratory.

Working with various

other agencies they developed the permanent solution -

Teflon Coated Fibre Glass Fabric.

This membrane is —

translusoent, abrasion resistant and non combustible.
This achievement immediately started showing the result.

Till the late sixties, tensile structures were
constructed as

'Prestressed‘

of the U.$. Pavalion in Expo

systems.

But by the completion

'70 in Osaka (Japan), a new

structural system was introduced -

'Air Supported' system.

In these type of structures the pressure inside the
structure acts as a pseudogravity which keep the comparatively light roof of cables and membrane in tension and
hence in proper shape.

The new experiment was an immediate

success - in the brief period from 1974 to 1984 a total of
seven air supported stadia were built,

the largest being

Pontiac.5tadium in Michigan which covers more than 10 acres
of unobstructed space.
