PROF.J.V:

My early practical experience was in Bridge Construction
and in Highways.

Based partly on my field experience,

I have written a text book on 'Bridge Engineering',
which is now in Third Edition and is followed in most
Universities in India.
By 1972, I felt convinced that IIT Madras should have a
post—graduate programme in the emerging area of Transportation Engineering.

So I contributed towards the develop—

ment of a M.Tech. course in this field, which was the
first programme in Transportation Engineering in the
IIT system.
CONTOUR:

What is the scope of 'wransportation Engineering' abroad
and in India at present? What are your predictions for
the future in the Indian context?

PROF.J.V:

Transportation Planning is a relatively new field, not
only in India but abroad also.

Government of India have

rightly recognised this as an ’Emerging Area of Technology', and, during the past 2 years, have allotted
Rs.20 lakhs for developing infrastructure for better
training in this area at IIT Madras.

Similar grants are

given to many other institutions also.
There is adequate scope for study in Transportation
Engineering in India and also in USA, Europe and Japan.
Developed countries have recognised the need for good
transportation many years back and are thus able to
sustain an industralised status.
In India, attention given to transportation in the past
has been inadequate to meet the demands for various
reasons.

Currently, the awareness of the importance of

transportation is increasing.
So in the near future, I
expect that engineers well trained in Transportation
Engineering will have bright prospects for fruitful
employment.
