Frame Based Reasoniggz

This is a structured knowledge representa-

tion technique which associates features with nodes representing
concepts on objects.

The features are described in terms of

their attributes (called slots) and their values.

One frame may

represent a concrete beam and another a whole class of beams
ie each class can be described as a specialisation of a more

general class.

Frames can be used to partition index and

organise a systems production rules.
Semantic nets are a network of nodes standing for concepts
on objects connected by arcs which describe relations between
nodes.
OBJECT ORIENTED PROGRAMMING

In object oriented programing all the action comes from
sending messages between objects.

Object scombine the proper-

ties of procedures and data since they perform computations and
save local state.
an operation

Instead of naming a procedure to perform

on an object one sends the obuect a message.

selection in a message specifies the kind of operation.

The

Objects

respond to messages using their own procedures for performing
operations.

Message sending and specialisation (Class inheri-

tance is used)

form important concepts in object oriented

programming, specialisation helps to avoid storing redundant
information and simplifies updating to modifications.
