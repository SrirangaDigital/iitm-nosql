At the window sill level, lintel level and

roof level the cavities are cloged.

1:6 cement mortar was used

for the construction of walls.

Ofcourse, a close supervision is very much required to
control the quality of construction.

The joints between the

shells and the joist, joints between the wall and the lintel
and sunshades etc. are to be sealed properly with cement
mortar.

During the last monsoon, damp patches were observed

on inside walls at the joints between wall and sunshades.

There was no dampness anywhere

on the ceiling.
