CONTOUR:

What are your current research interests?

How about

consultancy?

PROPuJ. V:

My current researCh interests include: Urban transportation planning, bus transit, and traffic safety, with
special emphasis on developing countries.

My latest

publication is an invited paper on 'Road accidents in
Indie' published in February 1989 issue of IATSS Research
from Tokyo.
My past consultancy projects included development of
specialised transport equipment and inspection of
construction.

While there are not many consultancy

projects forthcoming in my areas of current research, I
have been invited to serve on many technical committees.
The latest such assignment is Membership in the Expert
Group on Water Transport in India constituted by the
Science Advisory Council to the Prime Minister.
CONTOUR:

what is your opinion about students going abroad,

PROF.J. V:

Having studied and taught abroad, I would like to

especially those going for 'Transportation Engineeringâ€˜?

encourage students who wish to go abroad for higher
studies.

But I would advise that students, who seriously

try for admission to graduate programmes in Transportetion Engineering abroad, would do well to take a few
elective courses and projects in this area at IIT Madras.
This will be of much help to them in gaining an orientation.
Secondly, students should keep in mind that the techniques
that they study in USA or other industralised country
cannot be directly transported to India.

They should

learn to adapt the methodology of advanced countries to
the conditions prevailing in India.
CONTOUR: As a senior Professor, what are your expectations from
students?
PROF.J.V: The students are well motivated to study at IIT Madras.
They have the best of facilities here, and I am sure
