Masonry wall and reinforced

concrete roof are the two load

bearing structural components in any residential buildings.
These are the tWo major items, which consume a big percentage
of the total cost.

Quite a lot of research activities are

being carried out on structural and functional aspects of wall
and foof components of residential buildings

in many research

laboratories academic institutions in the country.

Different

bonds are being considered for masonry walls and different
structural forms for floors/roofs.

I tried the "rat-trap

masonry" for walls and funicular shell for roofs.

Rat—trap

masonry has been successfully used by the famous architect

BAKER in the places where the duration of monsoon is quite long
Many research papers are available in Indian as well as
International journals on structural strength and durability

As the size of the room decides the size of the

shell, it is necessary to have a minimum number of different
sizes of shells.
adopted as

Many different shell configurations can be

shown in figure 1.

As the number of joints

is more in the configurations 1(a) and l(b), the one shown in
figure l(c) is adopted.

In this the length of each shell

unit is 50 mm more than

the width of the room.

The longitudin-

al and cross—Sections of one shell unit adopted is shown in
figure 2.

To minimize the number of moulds to be prepared

to cast the shells, it was decided to use shells with same
dimensions for the whole building.

This put a dimensional

has to be kept same, and the other dimension an integer
multiple of one shell unit.
