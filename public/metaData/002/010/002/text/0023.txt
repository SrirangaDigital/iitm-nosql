when H.G. Wells, in the novel 'When the Sleeper Wakes'
looks into the twentysecond century, he writes of the city
of London covered by a transluscent membrane spanning to
cables that arch across the city.

Giant wind mills are

seen outside the city generating power on the inhabitants.
He seems to describe a time when fossil fuels are gone
and the city is encapsulated so as to give a controlled
environment.

Is it possible that this is the direction

in which technology is taking us?

Considering the history

of tensile structures over the last few decades, we can
similarly expect the future will be so shaped.

People on the move have used lightweight tensile
structures in the form of tents for many thousands of years,
the oldest made of branches and animal skins â€” going 20,000
to 30,000 years back.
size and shape.

Medieval

armies had tents of impressive

The large circus tent is one of the more

recent applications.

The main advantage of the above type of structures
was the very light weight of the root, and hence its ability
to cover very large area with minimum construction cost.
But the construction of a tent structure with a comparatively
long life period was impossible with the building materials
available in those times.

Then the arrival of steel cables

began to make an impact in this field.

Although the first recorded evidence for a structure
made of steel cables dates back to l620, the idea of using
