One of the most successful E S's in Civil Engg. has been

PROSBECTOR which helps geologists 10cate ore deposits.
The hallmark of E s is that the problem domain (knowledge
base) is separated from the systems other knowledge (inference
engine).

In E S‘ s branching is the rule rather than exceptim:

as in conventional algorithms.

Sensitivity Analysis (If X is

changed how is Soln. affected?) can be carried out in E S's.
In E S's knowledge is applied using shortcuts and tricks.

T TO N OF KNOWLEDGE

Rule Based Reasoning:
Knowledge is represented in the form of IF — Th‘Eh rules.
These rules represent processes driven by a complex and rapidly
changing environment.

a set of rules specify how the program

should react to the changing data without requiring detailed
information about the flow of control.

These rules adaptively

determine the best sequence of rules to execute.

Conclusions

can be explained by retracting the "ﬁgps‘ lf an antecedent
(IF ~--) is satisifed then so is the consequent.

If the con-

sequent (Then -~—) defines an action then the action is scheduled
for execution else a conclusion is inferred.
inference Methods;
got-ward Chfxining;

An inference method in which rules are

matched with facts to establish new facts.
