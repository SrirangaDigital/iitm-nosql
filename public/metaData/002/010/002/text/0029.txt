THE ammo INTERPRETATION OF THE mNTEEVEB APPROACH IN THE
CALCULATION or DEFLECTIONS

In the last issue of contour, we found that the deflections
on cantilevers and simply supported beams can be written down
directly by inspection treating each part of the structure as a
cantilever.

The results were based on the moment area theorems.

In this article we will go into an interesting exercise, the
kinematic interpretation of these results.
First let us take the case of cantilevers.
It can be seen that the fictitious cantilever deflections
in the cantilever method are nothing but the deflections on
the actual structure measured from an inclined base.
