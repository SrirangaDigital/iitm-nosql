will be quitgfnecessary to solve the basic problems of life such

as provision/shelter for masses,

drinking water etc. which are

yet to be solved by Civil Engineers of our Country.

The students

should therefore take interest in experimental and praCtical
projects also during their stay here.
Further I would request the students to reactivate our
Civil Engineering Association which is dormant for quite some
time nOW. Needless to point out that this is the only forum
through which our young students can come in contact with all

facultiEe: together and also with senior engineers in the
profession and benefit from their experience and expertise.
Lastly I wish all the students success in their ensuing

examinations and good luck in their professional career later on.
