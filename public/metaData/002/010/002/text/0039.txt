Robotics has started playing an important role in Structural Engg. Laboratories throughout the world.
Robotics involves the following:
+

Sensor and Sensor Understanding :Vision, Force and touch
capabilities

+ Manipulations and manipulation control: Robot arms should be
capegle of fast aocura to motion and should be capable of
graping all objects.
+

Object and Space Oriented Problem Solving:
Robots have to visualise how things fit together.

They

should move around without bumping into object 5, Robots need the
mathematical principles and both kinematics and dynamics. Relations between manipulation position,

orientation and joined

angles as also between point motions and required motion torque
have been derived.

Robots need mixed position and hence

controls as also spatial reasoning.
Once the research

in robatios

Civil Engineers will find a lot of use with them.
