only to the opposite walls.

This in turn brings down the number

of load bearing walls in the building.

As only external walls

and the internal load bearing walls need the foundation,

the

reduction in the total length of load bearing wall results
in reducing the foundation cost.

Other walls to divide the

rooms are constructed as partition walls, which requires only

a nominal foundation — i.e., thickening the floor concrete
below it.

The moment we think of a shell, the first thing that comes
to mind is the mould.

To cast the shells with the required

curvature, moulds are to be peepared.

The definition of the

funicular shell is that the shape of the shell is derived from
its dead weight.

Hence, the design was modifi-

the weight of a single piece to be lifted,

which in turn reduces the manpower required for the erection
of the roof system.

The modification carried out in the

design was the removal of the

edge beam from the shell unit

and combining the edge beams of two adjacent shells to form a
joist.

Figure 3 shows the details of joists and the shell

units after erection.

The thickness of the shell used is 25 mm

with only a 6 mm mild steel bar around it as reinforcement as
shown in figure.

The edges of the shells are flattened to get
