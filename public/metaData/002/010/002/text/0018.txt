Assembly of the roof system is completed as‘shown in figure 3.

The shear connectors provided ensures the monolithic

action of the roof system with precast and inwsitu concrete
elements.

The usual weathering course with brick pieces in

lime mortar was used to level the top of the roof.

As the strength of the

floors can be coﬁgtructed.

The overall savings in cost over

the conventional roofing system was worked out to about.30%:Morenthan this, the ceiling looks different and better(maybe
because it is different from the conventional one.)

Wall system
Now coming to the load bearing walls, one of the most
important constraint one should consider while designing
is its structural strength.
loads

i.e., its ability to bear the

of at least two storeys and possibly ohe more later.

Hence optimization in cost means reducing the materials

required for construction (i.e., bricks and cement) without
compromising its strength.

As the present roof is light com—

pared to the conventional slab type, the loads on the walls

are reduced.

Onebrick thick wall (9 inches or 230 mm thick)

was used for load bearing walls and the details of the bond
used to construct the wall is shown in figure 5.

Figures she) and 5(b) shows the plan of two successive
layers and 5(c), the elevation.

The size of the country brick

that is available in Madras is approximately 9" X 4.5"X 3"
(i.e., 230 mm X 115 mm X 75 mm).

The bricks are placed on

edge, which is not a common pgactice.
