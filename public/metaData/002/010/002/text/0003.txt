gap OF _l‘_H.E DEPﬂTMENT
I am happy to note that another issue of CONTOUR is being
brought out by the Editorial Committee.

On this occasion, I

wish to share a few thoughts of mine with the students of our
Department.
We are now living in a period of "Computer Revolution".
While the capabilities of the computer like speed, memory etc.
are being considerably enhanced, their prices are being continuously slashed down.

It appears that the time is not far off

when you can have a P.C. with the capabilities of CRAY on your
table.

These developments have changed the attitude and approach

to work in all walks of life, particularly in the field of
planning, analysis and design in Civil Engineering.

l

Faster,

better and more economical solutions even to problems hitherto
unattempted are in sight.

I am happy to note that many of our

students have realised these potentialities and are striving to
equip themselves with the latest in this area.
While I commend this trend towards computer, I cannot help
pointing out another not so desirable trend on the part of our
students.

More and more of them are drifting towards analysis

and theory oriented projects 211—11.

Their interest in experimental

and practical oriented projects is declining.

With the help of

West German Government and Universities, we have established
laboratories comparable to any of the best in the world.

Indian

Institute of Technology, Madras is known for its strength in
experimental research. Continued efforts are being made to add
latest equipments and modernise the laboratories under special
funds.

Good knowledge and training in practical oriented projects
