From the Editors....
Hi folks!

It is nice to be back with you with another

issue of 'CONTOUR'.

This issue fegtures an interview with

Prof. Johnson Victor, an article on residential building construction by Mr. S. Rajeev, several interesting articles from students
and much, much more.

Before you proceed further we will give you

a brief update of the happenings in our Civil Engg community.
The job prospects for us Civil Engineers, we feel, are
brightening with many more companies coming for placement this
year.

Although the number of B.Techs who have got jobs remains

more or less the same as last year, it looks as if there will be
an increase in the demand for Civil Engineers in the coming years.
This probably coincides with the present trend of many major
companies going in for expansion in a big way.
It is really too early to comment on the "aid scene" anyway, only a handful of students have received the'good news'
from the U.s. till now.
The GATE results this year have proved yet again that
practically no B.iech

student is interested in pursuing higher

studies in India.
Now a word

about SEA activities — after 8 months of

hibernation CEA has woken up at last — the first meeting of this
academic year was held in the end of March.

Prof. Santha Kumar

of Anna Univ. gave a very interesting lecture about Tall Structures
an the occasion.

There was even a good student turnout!!!

hope that the faculty and the students will continue to work
