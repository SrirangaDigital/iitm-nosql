FORM AND SPACE

"We put thirty spokes together and call it a wheel
But it is on the space where'there is nothing that
the utility of the wheel depends.
We turn clay to make a vessel;
But it is on the space where there is

nothing

that the utility of the vessel depends.
We pierce doors and windows to make a house;
and it is on these spaces where there is
nothing that the utility of the house depends.
Therefore, just as we take advantage of what is,

we should recognize the utility of what is not."
