actual deflections on the simply supported beam.

Hence the

actual rotation at L. A = DA F AB'A.
And the actual rotation at any point on the beam will be

equal to the fictitious cantilever rotation minus 0A.
In order to calculate the deﬂections at any point on the
simply supported beam, we considered the point as the fixed

end of two fictitious cantilevers on either side (Fig. - 33).
The reactions were replaced by equivalent forces.

The delfec-

ted shape under this condition is given in Fig. - 30.
points 13' and A' are at different elevations.
ence in elevations of these two points is
Hence the chord A'B'

The

The

differ-

A ‘1 — A'B

is inclined to the horizontal by an

angle 0 = (AA' - AB')/l
In order to bring the chord A'B' to a horizontal poaition
rotate the diagzam by O
In this position the beam is kinematically equivalent to
the actual simply supported beam, and the deflections measured
about the Line A'B' give the true deﬂections.

Hence the

actual rotation at the point C;

G C:

(AA’ - AB')/J..

It is a simple geometric exercise to prove that the dis-

tance of 0‘ from the line A‘B' is
which is the actual displacement At
