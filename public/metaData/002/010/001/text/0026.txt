water, dust or smoke, the tornado is invisible.
The wall or the funnel is sharply defined, smooth
and dense. The internal cavity in hurricanes is of the
order of a few hundred metres. This resembles the'eye
of the storm'

of hurricanes. The movement of air inside

the cavity is directed vertically downward and often
attains great speed. It causes the formation of the
cascade and facilitates the movement of hurricane. In
the walls of the tornado, on the contrary, the movement
of air is directed upward in spiral form and often attains
unusual speeds of upto 100—200 m/s. Dust, debris, other
objects, people and animals are lifted into the walls of the
tornado. The cavity is usually empty. The rotational speed
or the funnel (the wind speed in its walls) determines the
main properties of the tornado. It often exceeds even the
speed of sound in air (532 m/s).

ence, accurate and direct

measurements of the wind speed in tornadoes are difficult.
The speed of rotation in the funnel is very high and changes
considerably. The lower part of the "unnel rotates consi—
derably faster than the upper part. In the formation of a
tornado, the parent cloud and the funnel assume the main
role. The auxillary vortex originates at the base of the
funnel, does not rise high but often rotates around the
funnel and reaches the cloud. The auxiliary vortex gives
rise to cascade and envelope. The weight of the funnel of
the tornado is more than half a million ton. The weight of
the parent cloud would he immeasurably more. Tornadoes occur
frequently in USA, Western Europe, France, Alpa valleys,
sweden, Germany, Switzerland, North Vietnam, Japan, China
Australia and Africa. A few other places have also experiencec‘
tornadoes, but loss frequently.
