TORNADOEL,‘
Dr. K. srinivasan
The history of earth' 5 surface is comprised of
combined series of

'evolutionury'

and 'revolutionary'

processes. Evolutionary' processes are usually gradual
and prolonged in nature. on the other hand 'revolutionary'
processes are sudden and catagrophic which lead to deaths

of millions of people and loss of billions worth of
property. Tornadoes belong to the latter category.

A tornado is a very rapidly rotating air funnel

hanging from a cumulonimbus cloud. It is usually observed
as a funneloshaped cloud. It is the smallest in size and
greatest in speed of rotation among all the formations
with vertex motion in the atmosphere. The tornado cloud

is cery often accompanied by a thunderstorm, hail and
heavy downpour of strength and size. This originates
under synoptic conditions, mostly along the line of the

fronts of warm and cold air currents. On an average, the
tornado clouds will be 5-10 km in length, 5-15 km in

height. Large tornadoes willhave a cloud

width of 50—40 km

and length 50 km. The base is flat, dense and horizontal,

with distinct protruberances of funnels from it.
structure of Tornado;
The tornado consists of three parts:

i ) Horizontal vortex in the parent cloud
ii ) Funnel
iii) Auxiliary vortex

The funnel is the main component of the tornado. It has a
spiral: vortex consisting of very rapidly rotating air.

since

water and dust are entrained in the air, usually the funnel
can be seen clearly. whenever, the air is clean without
