branch left out of micro-computer treatment.
Specifically these machines have by far made much in—
roads in; (5.) water and waste water

fields—water supply

regulation, operational control, process control for treatment
plants, water network analysis, automation in billing process
mapping and design, power usage optimisation and control,
maintenance of plants etc. (ii) Reservoir simulation—micro
mathematical programming reservoir rule curve model, reservoir
optimisation, gaming simulation, meta-games command area water
management, economics analysis model (iii) groundwater simula—
tion and optimisation-well hydraulics, regional modelling and
control, solute transport in aquifers, saltwater intrusion...
the list goes on.
Let's see some of the elegant general purpose software,
like wordstar, Database management, spreadsheet, Graphics 9nd
communications(i_n all these cases improved Versions .1 ways
follow suit immediately).
