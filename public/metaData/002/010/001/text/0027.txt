CANTILEVER APPROACH IN THE BENDING OF BEAMS
____________________________________________

BENNY RAPHAEL, 3/4 B.TECH.
Calculation of the deflections is an important step in
the analysis of structures.
deflections is

The usual method of finding the

based on the moment area theorems.

But this

happens to be very tedious (At least an average student thinks

so).

One has to draw the bending moment diagram, find its

area, moment of this area and so on.

Is there any way of

writing down the deflections by inspection, just like we find
the bending moment at some section?

Is it not possible to

use some standard results to compute these quantities instead
of dealing with geometric figures?
questions

Let me try to answer these

DEFLECTIONS ON CANTILEVERS:

The detlections on cantilevers could be written down
directly by inspection, by converting them into fictitious
cantilevers,

as shown below:

the point D of the cantilever AE shown in Fig.1, the span
AD could be divided into fictitious cantilever.
as shown in Fig.2.

Consider the external loading acting on

the corresponding parts of the fictitious cantilever.

Also

consider the shear and bending moments at the points B,C and D
