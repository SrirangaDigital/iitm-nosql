'ACTIVATED CARBON IN PHYSICO—CHEMLQAL_TREATMENT UNITS'

Mr. K. Gopalakrishna

The legislations regarding effluent standards though
mandatory, have their own limitations when implementing
on a small industry.

The constraints for the industry

would be the availability of funds and required technical
manoower.

An example could be the cluster of small chrome

tanneries in Madras which has resulted in heavy ground water
pollution.

In these instances we can encourage collective treat—
ment systems which are constructed and maintained by the
industries from the less collected.

he can also go in

for biological treatment units after addition of nutrients
from municipal waste water.

However, wherever we are not

able to supplement the nutrients we may have to go in for
more expensive ohysico—chemical units after recovery of
recoverable products.

Physico—chemical units generally

include chemical coagulation,

carbon adsorption and

filtration.

Activated carbon can be prepared from various
materials such as peat,

lignite,

wood or coconut shell.

The widespread process for the

coal and charcoal from

preparation of activated carbon is thermal activation.
To begin

with,

the raw material is carbonized to obtain

a cok; with which steam is made to react at 900°C to llOO°C
in order to enlarge the pore volume.

In the chemical

activation process dehydrating products such as chl2 are
used to abstract the water from the carbohydrates of the
starting material.

Carbonisation is nerformed at 4000 to

500°C and activation is carried out in the absence of air

at 500°C to 700°C.
