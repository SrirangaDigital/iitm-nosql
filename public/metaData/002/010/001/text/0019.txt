Cloud‘oursts often accompany the tornado and the resulting
stream of water causes pits 5—6 meters wide and more than
one metre deep. Also, hailstones of about 30 cm circumference have been observed along with the tornado cloud at
many places in the USSR 8: USA. sometimes even air-planes
are frozen as to form the hailstone nucleus.

There are also special forms of tornadoes such as Water
spouts and Fire Tornadoes.

Tornadoes passing over the sea

or large lakes are known as Water spouts. They are accom-

panied by terrifying sounds. Water Spout is often stationary
and the duration is generally 15-20 minutes. Many times it
is not visible. water =Spouts’seem to connect the water
body forming significant cascades. On the other hand, Fire
Li‘ornadoes are always accompanied by enormous amounts of heat

and they can be grouped under Volcanic Erruptions, fires
and exploeions.
Destruction Activity of Tornadoes
The causes of destruction of tornadoes can be broadly

listed as: (1) the wall thrust by funnels (2) lifting and
splintering in the air, (5) vortex motion in the funnel.
The following incident giving an account of the destruction

of the Irving bridge in USA (which was-caused by the strongest
and longest—lasting tornado 'Irvingx (1897) named after
the township), is an evidence for the power of the tornadoes.
The iron bridge was new. It was 75m long and the track
of the tornado lay right across it. The funnel just touched

it and lifted it up so fast that the stone pillars on which
the bridge rested were not damaged at all. On one pillar
even the top layer of cement was intact and from another only
