compared with that in distilled water.

It has been found

that the sediment volume with 0.025% Nacl is essentially
the same as that obtained with distilled water.

Further

the time duration for equilibration drastically reduced to

less than 24 hours with 0.025% of Noel.
Hence it is proposed that the free swell test could be
carried out with 0.025% Nacl as an additive to obtain re—
liable results.

With this change,

the free swell technique

becomes a viable, simple and fast technique for quantifying
swelling potential.

The tests were also conducted with the

U S B R Specifications in an oedometer to study the swelling
potential of compacted samples and has been compared with
free swell results.

The agreement has been found to be

good.
