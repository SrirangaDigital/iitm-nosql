For real time applications in natural systems,

eg: river

basin planning, micrOS monitor the states of river, its
tributaries and the rainfall surrounding the areas for the
collection of data to assist in the management of the river
and to provide a research basis into the behaviour of the
river valley. These micros are used to perform many tasks
in river planning management like;

sampling measurements,

check the received data, convert the coded data, hold the
data base, check the data against predefined limits, record
the data in graphical form, punch a record on a paper tape,
print the results on paper, enable changes to be made to the
data base and disPlay the data on the mimic diagram etc.
Micro's use as self—instructional aids is fast progressing
in water resources disciplines. Now the situation is that
while the so called fourth and fifth generation computers are
performing their jobs silently, these micros are rearing and
are violently dancing to the well—designs rmd ill-designs,
whimsical and non-whimsical fashions of many of us. God only
knows that one fine morning these mieros may even keep a
distance away from mainframes (ahead of them). Already computer
guys have started talkingabout super micro computer establish—
ment on desk-top» while the advancements in micro computer
technology is far reaching, no one needs to have a (cyberphobia
or worry as these machines will never replace the civil
engineer but will only allow him to do his job much better
and faster (due apologies to female civil engineers for not
using 'her' ).
Now let's see the micros extensive usage in all the
branches of water engineering.
