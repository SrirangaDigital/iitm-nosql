ultimate skin friction resistance is mobilised at a strain
of approximately 1 '/. of tho diameter of tho pile and the
base resistance is reached at strains of about 10 7. diame—
ter (Whitaker and Cooke 1966).

This means that the design

of the piles for structures of restricted settlement must be
properly proportioned apart from factor of safety against
failure.

{Enlarged bases for piles and Gaissons will provide

increased bearing capacity only at larger settlements and the
shaft adhesion is fully mobilised at working loads om lower
strains.

The efficiency of soil anchors is also dependent on

the level of strains in the soil.

The movrm-rnt of a tied back

wall should bc monitored so that the

stretch of the anchors

arc evaluatod to ensure that stability of thn cut face is
maintained.
Contact pressure distribution br‘low foundations is also
dependent on the strain m bﬂised at the interface and naturally varies with the type of foundation,

rigid or flexible.

It may also be of interest to note that in the Case of rafts
on sand bed overlying thick layer of soft clays,

thc stress

distribution may change with time due to consolidation and
the reinforcements to be provided will haVc to satisfy both
short term and long tcrm settlement.
In tho problems involving stability of slepes also the
influence of strain will have to be accounted for,
in composite dams.

especially

The cohesion and friction parameters to be»

used are not the ultimate value-s as cohesion is mobilised at
very low strain and friction at larger strains.

An alterna-

tive method is: to go in for finite Clsz’n‘t analysis which
again requires a reliable stress strain relationship of the
