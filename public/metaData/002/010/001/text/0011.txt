How can one use the ESP?

ESP is user friendly and provides efficient data entry
methods.

A vast array of recoverable information can be

presented in graphical,

tabular,

synoptic,

statistical,

histogram and 3D visualisation forms.

ESP can operate in either 'expert' or 'intcractive’
mode.

The

'expert system‘ made is particularly useful as

inexperienced users simply select a function such as

'comfort‘,

'plant sizing', or ’energy consumption estimation'.

The

system will set up and perform the required simulations,
analyse the results and generate the appropriate information answering the design question.

The

'interactive' mode enables Special analyses to be

conducted or additional investigations to be undertaken.
In this mode the user defiL s the problem, selects a path
through the various program modules and then interprets
the simulation results.

Use of ESP under Indian conditions

To the best of my knowledge ESP has not been used
for the Indian conditions.

So the first problem would be

to validate the ESP for Indian conditions.

The problem

of dividing India into precise climatic zones, validating
the ESP under the different zones and evolving criteria
for comfort in the various zones can form the basis for
a comprehensive research project in Building Technology
involving laboratory work,

field measurements and

computational work.
