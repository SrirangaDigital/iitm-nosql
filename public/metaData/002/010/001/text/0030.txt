second or even less time with

whom we are unable to communicate as of present. Are not the
micro computer technological achievements simply comparable
to that of this guy's, considering its rapid stride in soft/
hardware develoyment in every nook and corner?. But then one
must not forget that the hunger of micros is even more than
that of an elephant's in feeding..are we satisfying this
hunger?.. a moot point indeed.
whatever the iseue may be; the micros have now certainly

become a way of life and havo oven turned out to be "micros
for every one"!. Coming to our civil engineering guys (discussion is restricted to those B.Tech in our institute), the
quick understanding and reaction of these guys to micro
computer problems, associated software and problem solving
etC.

is simly noteworthy. This article is therefore primarily

written to further enrich (further emphasized) their
understanding.
