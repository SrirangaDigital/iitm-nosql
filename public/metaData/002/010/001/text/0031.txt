Under the vagaries in our universal climatic system
there are floods...rloods... in one season and droughts..
droughts..in one other season!....Alos!

..what a recurring

menace indeed. While it is an established fact that areas
adjoining a river, for eg: the Ganges always suffer due to
recurring floods, the same areas also are infrequently

vulnerable to droughtsl. It can be quoted here that the
holy Varnasi City had experienced acute water shortage
problems sometime back. Many of us know that Tamilnadu is
the regular receipient of drought. There is no vagary or
doubt about it. Met it is surprising that once our neighborv
hood area Narayanapuram (remember IIT's 0RD site—office
once was functioning there) had experienced intensive floods
to the extent of even seeing the surface of Bay of Bengal
from Velechery road. what an extreme- flood and drought! .

SO..in a nut—shell, while earth's climatic system
gives us regular dosages of droughts and floods alternativel:
(unique decision of nature, hence there is no decision
management etc. needed by nature), it is only floods in the
case of micro—computer technological advancements both in
software and hardware developments as one could perceive. In
innumerable ways, the potential of micros is tested by our

civil engineers. "Micro—computerisation" in many civil magi-—
neering discigplines is on the rampage. These small machines
(but with geater potentials) are being extensively used as
solution tools, remote terminals/controls, instruments and

so on. Already in many countries "field computers" have
come into existence. People now talk about....who will win?
USA or Japan. But many of us are aware that small countries
like Isreal and the Netherlands are making big head ways in
micro computer developments and applications.
