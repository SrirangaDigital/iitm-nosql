Where XCD and XBD are the distances of C and B measured
from D.

On dividing the real beam into fictitious cantiLEVers
(1)

each fictitious cantilever should be of uniform cross
section.

(2)

the standard values of deflections for the end shear, end
moment, and the load in each fictitious nantilever should
be known.

(The resultant deflection

would be the sum

of the individual effects of end shear, end moment and

load on the span).
The standard result are given below:
