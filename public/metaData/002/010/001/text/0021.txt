concept of limiting deformation is even more important in the
case of passive pressure development.

A strain of the order

of 4. ‘/. is required if the full passive pressure is to be
mobilised.

Design of anchors for prestressing beds, dock

structures etc. are particularly governed by this.

Even

though adequate factors of safety may be available against
ultimate failure, the deformation at the top of the struc—
ture may be so sigxificant as to defeat the purpose of the

A typical example of this situation was brought to light
