are sucked and. lifted into the clouds and dropped elsewhere.

Various insects, mollusks, shells, marine creatures, jelly
fish and crabs are also often lifted up enmass into the
clouds and dropped from the sky at farther places, along with
the rain. Rains with frogs and fish are quite frequent as a
result of tornadoes.

sometimes, even tortoises, toads and

rats are reported to be dropped.

They have been many incidents where due to the suction
of a few metres of water from the rivers and lakes, the de3
have been exposed. The entire water in deep wells would be
sucked up and emptied completely.

In conclusion, eventhough tornadoe is mainly a
meteorological phenomenon, it is geographical as well,
because of its ability to change various surface features

of the earth in an unparalleled way.
