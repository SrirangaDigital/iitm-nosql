combinaticn of stresses.

Large shear

strains can also cause a lowering of the friction to the residual value, a factor which has to be taken into consideration in
the Analysis of long term stibility of slopes in area subjected
to shear move-mg nt 5.
There is thus great neéd fur knowing the stress strain
characteristics of sails under a wide range cf stress and strain
pelths for prediction of soil behaviour.

Unfortunctcly natural

soil is a material which does In t navy e. uniquc stress—strain
relation.

Among the. many sources of inaccuracies in estimating

deformations in soil mechanics are thc diffcrcnces between stress
conditions existing in the

field and the laborrtcry tests and the

effect of disturbance on thr strvss-strzin prcpcrties of the soil.
There are also cases where unpreditable changcs may occur par—
ticularly in cleys due to which unexpected deformations may
occur.

They may be due to environmental changes and changes in

usage of the structure .

Only

by examining the reasons for such

changes will it be possible for any r medial mussures to field
damages to be undertaken.
