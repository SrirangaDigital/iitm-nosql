INDIA'S POOR pRmEcT IMPLEMENTATION RECORD
JOJU.M.MICHEL

Although our country spends billions of rupees in its
development effort, its track record in implementing major
projects is abysmal.

The projects which are supposed to be

over decades ago are still going on, draining a significant
portion

of citizens'

savings in the process.

It is now

estimated that 264 union qovernment projects for which an
original cost of Rs.42,935 crores had been budgeted, will
now cost Rs.64,448 crores — an aggregate cost overrun of
staggering 50.1%.

Why does this happen?

The once prestigious

salal hydro—electric project may be the best example showing
this sorry state of affairs.
The salal project was planned to be the first in a
series designed to exploit the rich hydro-«electric potential

of chenalb river, estimated at more than 3 million kWh per
annum.

The project was cleared by the Central Government

eighteen years ago, with an estimated cost of 55.15 crores.
Although the original completion date was 1978, it is yet
to produce a single unit of electricity.

The current

estimated cost of the project is about 568 crores.
This fate was evident right from the beginning.

Although

some work on the development of intra structure such as to
smoothen the rocky roads to the project site in the lower
reaches of the pi): panjal bills 80 km north of Jammu, began
by 1970, work at the main site of salal did not begin till
eight years later.

The reason was purely a diplomatic one.

Until an agreement was negotiated with Pakistan on the key
question of the sharing of waters of the Indus and its
tributaries, which was finally accomplished in 1978, the
project was inviable.

This lead to a lot of criticism about

the utter lack of foresight on the part of Union Government,
which could well have set about executing the project while
simultaneously negotiating an agreement with Pakistan on the
river waters question.
