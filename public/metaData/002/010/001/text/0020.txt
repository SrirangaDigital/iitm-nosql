THE SIGNIFICANCE UF DEFCJRMATIOIV IIV SOIL

PROF. T-s-MAMANATHJL IYER
The general concept in mast soil mechanics problems such
as foundation,

stability of slopes and embankments etc. cent-

res around the factor of safety against failure of the soil

mass.

However soil deformations well below working loads are

equally important and methods of evaluating them to a reasonable degree of accuracy are required in a number of cases, as
mentioned by Roscoe in his Rankine lecture in 1970.

The case

of limiting settlement (total and differential settlement) is
only one example of this requirement.
In the conventional design of structures,

it is custo—

mary to adopt limits of total and particularly differential
deformation criteria for various types of structures based on
their uses and materials of which they are made of.

These

deformations may be immedi te (contact) or delayed (consolidation).

It is possible to reasonably predict these, as a

function of time.
The majority of problems involving, soil—structure interaction such as pressures behind a retaining wall need the concept of strain.

In the case of design of retaining walls, the

use of active pressure involves the assumption that a strain
of approximately 0.3 '/.

is mobilised at every point in the

assumed failure wedge and consequently the top of the wall
should move away from the backfill by an amount which will
mobilise this strain.

If it does not,

the pressure for

which the wall is to be designed is not the least (active
pressure) and much larger design values are required.
