The proofs of these results are based on the moment area
theorems .

This method could be very useful for finding the flexib—
ility coefficients in the consistent deformation method or the
absolute stiffness eoefficients for the moment distribution
method, in the analysis of indeterminate structures.

I hope that this small work will be a convenient tool
for calculating the deflections determinate structures.
