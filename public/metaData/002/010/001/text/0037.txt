If there is some arbitrary loading on some part, its

effect should be considered separately.

Integration should be

carried out for that load alone on the fictitious cantilever.

(4)

If there are inclined members forming the cantilever,

the relation between the real beam deflections and the end
rotations and deflections of each fictitious cantilever could
be got from the geometry of the structure.
