To find the end rotations DA and GB for a simply supported
beam AB shown in Fig.3.

Consider the fictitious cantilever

A’B’ (Fig.4) on which the same load acts.
at B by an equal force RB'
end rotation 6%

Replace the reaction

Find the end displacementlﬁB' and

for this fictitious cantilever.

Then the

actual end rotations are
53!

Note that the fictitious cantilever A'B' could further
be divided conveniently to get standard cantilever parts as
explained in the previous section.

If there is any over hang the loads on the over hanging
portion could be replaced by the resulting moments at the
supports.
