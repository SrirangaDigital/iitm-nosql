WATER PLEASE 9

Oh

What a wonder

When I hear of thunder

Hope Iain would come under
But not a tiny drop
Even for the whithering crﬁp
Cows Chew dry hay
No greens all the way

Lakes and ponds look dry
Pumping water make hands cry
Flood's fury frightens North
Drought's eerie dance in South
Fate started laughing loud
Find the way you could
Sending man in cloud
Is not enough it said
Weeping wasted forty years
Link the mighty rivers
With their southern sisters
Let them garland for ever
India our beloved mother.
