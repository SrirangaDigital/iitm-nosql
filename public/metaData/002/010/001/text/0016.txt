The internal surface area of activated carbon in
usually expressed on the BET [Brunauer Emmet and Teller]
surface in mZ/gm.

There a_e two types of activated

carbon generally used in practice

granular activated

carbon used in adsorption cci-mn,

and powdered activated

carbon used as solution in batch processes.

The surface

to 107 m2/gm,

The remaining dispensed carbon is then

removed by filtration.

Granular carbon is used solely in

the form of packed beds or columns as deep as 3 to 10 m,
through which effluent is passed either in upward or
downward direction.

A good activated carbon

content should be less than 10% by weight.

Hydrated carbon

is generally corrosive to steel.

The process of carbon adsorption becomes very
expensive if the spent carbon is wasted without regeneâ€”
ration.

Particularly in India where the cost of product-

ion of activated carbon is likely to be high,

an efficient

regeneration system for the reuse of spent carbon is

necessary.
Regeneration involves two consecutive phases,

the

desorption of the matter fixed on thc carbon and the
so called reactivation,
