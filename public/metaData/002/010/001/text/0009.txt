QAQ_;N BUILDING TECHNJLQQX
Dr. M.S. Mathews.
ABACUE is the computer group of the University of
Strathalyde,

Scotland.

ABACJS is widely regarded as one of

the ﬁcremost research units concerned with the develOpment
of computer-based techniques for appraising many aspects
of building design and oerformance.

Even though ABACUS

has developed a number of packages,

this article briefly

reviews the E.S.P. package only.

E.S.P. stands for Environmental Systems Performance,
and is a result of over 10 man-years of research and
development effort at ABACbS.

ESP is probably the most

advanced simulation model of the energy flow processes
associated with building performance.

It is used on a day—

to—day basis by many of the worlds leading building research
laboratories — yet it is simple to use — and is proving to
be an essential design tool to an increasing number of
consultants,

architects and local authorities.

The high predictive accuracy of the program has been
demonstrated in a number of U.K, U.S and EEC validation
studies; ESP is also used by the EEC as their reference
model for the appraisal of hi—tech passive solar design.

When can one use ESP?

ESP can be used at any stage of the design process.

ESP enables the designer, for the first time,
an indepth understanding of the complex.

to develop

inter-relation—

ships between fundamental design criteria and the cost
effective, energy conscious, performance of the resulting
building.
