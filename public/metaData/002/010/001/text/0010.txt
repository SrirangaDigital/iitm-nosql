ABSTRACT:

Sridharan et al (1985) proposed the use of free swell
tests for the classification of the soil's swelling potential.
They defined free swell index as the sediment volume in cc/gm
occupied by a unit weight of oven dried soil in water under
no external constraint.

In another paper, Sridharan et al

(1986), the same authors developed the differential free swell
test comparing the sediment Volumes in water and carbon tetra
chloride to represent swelling potential.

The scientific basis

for the various methods used in classification has been 6X62
mined by Sridharan and Rao (1988).
butions,

In spite of these contri-

limitations exist in the use of free swell tests for

classification of soils for their swelling potentials. Soils
with high colloidal fraction cannot be identified by the
differential free swell test, because of long duration (even
upto two weeks) required to settle down.
To overcome this difficulty,

series of free swell tests

were conducted on l5 natural soils of liquid limites varying

from 43% to 124% with 0.01% to 1% of Nacl by weight, to study
the time taken for equilibration of sediment volume.

The

sediment volume with various percentages of Nacl has been
