ESP is being successfully applied to predicting the

environmental (thermal) performance of a growing number of
major constructional projects both in the U.K. and Overseas.
ESP is not restricted to new sophisticated, highly stressed,
high technology buildings but can be economically and succe—
ssfully applied to simple retrofit projects and energy
audit tasks.

whgt guestinns_will ESP answer?
1.

What,

and when, are the peak building or plant loads

and what are the rank ordered causal energy flows?
2.

What will be the effect of some design change, such as

increasing the wall insulation, changing the glazing type
or distribution, re—zoning the building, re-configuring
the plant or changing the control regime?
3.

What is the optimum plant start time or the most

effective algorithm for weather anticipation?
4.

How will comfort levels vary throughout the building?

5.

What is the contribution (to energy saving) of a range

of passive solar features?
6.

What is the optimum arrangement of constructional elements

to encourage good load levelling and hence efficient plant
operation?

7.

What are the energy consequences of non-comoliance

with prescriptive energy regulations or, conversely,
how should a design be modified to come within some deemed
to satisfy performance target?
