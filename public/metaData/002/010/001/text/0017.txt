Under aero ic conditions Lacteria are

able to mineralise organic compounds adsorbed by the
carbon.

This involves the aeration of the spent carbon

in a separate vessel for the required decomposition of
the adsorbed compounds.

Obviously this is limited to

bio—degradable organic compounds.

Chemical regeneration

involves several washings of the spent carbon.

For

example desorption of phenols with caustic soda.

This

technique is oriented to industrial applications in which
the desorbed substances are recycled into another process.

In thermal regeneration, water and volatile organic
matter adsorbed are evaporated and the remaining organic
products are carbonised.

This involves heating of the

carbon in a furnace under a controlled atmosphere,

so

that organics are volatalised without combustion of the
carbon.

The gases are burnt.

Multiple hearth furnace or

rotary kiln could be used for this purpose.

The temperature

of carbon is gradually increased to 950°C with steam
injection.

It can be Concluded that activated carbons could be
used as a very good adsorbent in the physico—chemical
treatment units of industrial and municipal waste waters

Hence if proved economical it can take its place in

the arsenal of weapons to be used in the fight to control
water pollution problem.
