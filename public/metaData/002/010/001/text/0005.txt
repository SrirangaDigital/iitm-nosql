It gives me great pleasure to learn that the students
of Civil Engineering are bringing out the next issue of Contour,

a student magazine for Civil Engineering and related interests.
At the outset, I congratulate the Editors and all those res—
ponsible for bringing out this issue of Contour.
In a developing country like ours,

the Civil Engineers

have a major role to play in building up the infrastructural
facilities in the very important areas of housing, water supply,
sanitation,

irrigation, transportation, industrial structures,

ports and harbours.

The graduates of IIT have a special

responsibility in the above nation—building activities.

The

nation expects them to play a leading role in design, analysis,
construction, innovation and optimisation.

With the intro—

duction of personal computers and more recently computer
work-stations, curriculum and training pattern in IIT has been
Vastly re—organised to suit the modern developments.

With

the excellent training that has been imparted to the high
calibre basic material of the IIT students,

I am sure they

can play a leading role in the national development in the
years to come.
I wish all the Civil Engineering students success
in their career.
