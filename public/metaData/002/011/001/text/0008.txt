consider the dube as being viewed from the t0p at all times.

That

is, in all the diagrams a square represents the visible top face,
while two more sides show themselves in a picture view such as
in fig.

1.

Most of the terms depicted in Fig.1 need no further explanation.

Colours are not indicated, but it is understood that each

BIDCK has a unique colour combination, though their pattern may

be all jumbled to start with.

While handling the cube, we need

some tax; way of distinguishing the various faces.

A.convenient

REFERENCE basis is provided by the colours of the six CENTRE
blocks,which cannot change their relative positions with respect
to eachother.

In contrast, the EDGE and CORNER blocks are free

to be moved about with the reference remaining fixed.

Each FACE of the cube is identified by the colour of its
centre block, and if we ROTATE the whole cube, the reference
changes from our Viewhpoint, because it is fixed on the cube.

Thus

the TOP face which may have been 'red', can become 'green' after
a rotation, while 'red' may have moved to the FRONT face.

Anyway

we will not be concerned with actual colours, but only whether
the edge and corner blocks appearing on a face have the right colour
or not, i.e. matching the centre block.

The group of nine blocks on any face forms a LAYER, which
holds together while it is TURNED.

The turning of a layer is the

only movement available for altering block positions with respect

to the dube's reference basis.

Note that rotation of the cube

changes the reference as seen by us, whereas turning of a layer
does not.

Each of the mobile edge and corner blocks has a unique 'home'
position in the final solution.

It is not only their LOCATION
