DESIGN IMPROVEMENT _IN_ 2-STROKE s; ENGINE 19 REDUCE Loss 9_E_
FRESH CHARGE

In the new design of the twoâ€”stroke SI engine developed at the

1.0. Engines Laboratory I.I.T. Madras, two read valves are fitted

at the top of the transfer ducts.

These valves allow air from the

atmOSphere to enter into the crankcase through the transfer ducts
during the upward movement of the piston.

The working of the

system is as follows:

When the piston moves upward subatmOSpheric pressure is

deve10ped in the crankcase and transfer ducts.

Hence air fuel

mixture enters into the crankcase in the conventional way.
Simultaneously pure air gets in through the read valves into the

transfer ducts.

This air fills the transfer ducts.

During the

downward movement of the piston when the transfer ports open the
trapped air in the transfer ducts enters the cylinder first and
only a little later the air-fuel mixture enters.

This air hence

becomes the main component to get short-circuited and thereby
the following fuel air mixture gets retained to a large extent.
Fig.1 (attached) illustrated the principle.

Considerable improve-

ment in fuel economy and reduction in exhaust emissions have
been observed with this device.
