"When an ordinary bathroom shower is turned on, one of the
following possibilities is likely to occur (among others such as

there being no water supply at all!):-

a. Water flow from the shower head starts instantly and continues
steadily.

b. There is an initial pause for a few seconds before steady
flow commences.
c. An instant spray of water comes first, followed by a pause,
after which steady flow starts.
Can these occurrences be explained using principles of elementary
physics?"
This question, in somewhat different wording which emphasised

the thirdpossibility, was put to the student: of a predominantly
first-year B.Tech. hostel, and a small treat was offered for the
best answer.

Initially there were just two responses, so a hint

and some insulting comments on their capabilities were put up, which
ultimately brought in a dozen entries over a week.

Sad to say, most

of the answers were wide off the mark, and even those who mentioned
the right principles get mixed up in the explanation.
The reason for posing the question to first-year students was
the suspicion that they might still remembei some school physics and

be relatively unspoiled by the IIT system (of which more later).
The explanation involves only some simply'physics, provided one takes
the trouble of observing the phenomenon carefully (the description

given in the question is not quite complete).

No knowledge of

special areas like fluid mechanics is needed, thoughzl

little

curiosity would certainly help.

In practical terms, it is the sort of thinking which should
be encouraged particularly among prospective mechanical and
chemical engineers, at least those who have intentions of becoming
