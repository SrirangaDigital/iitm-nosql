workshops and laboratories maybe deemed to rust away, with much of
it already under dust and cobwebs.
The drift in emphasis is eSpecially damaging in a mechanical
engineering curriculum.

If the exposure to machines is primarily

through idealized formulae and graphics packages, it reduces the

ability to deal confidently with real machines.

Once the basic

principles are learnt, hands-on exposure should be given priority,
provided competent instruction is available.

Modelling and

simulation are no doubt powerful computer techniques, but they are
best used by persons whose knowledge goes beyond the theoretical

to include a concept of the extent of idealization and approximation in the equations being used.

Otherwise results can be

misinterpreted and errors remain undetected.

The computer screen

will not display the grease and dirt, or the jammed and broken parts.

Lamenting the state of affairs is of course very easy, and

persons likethe present writer may keep at it a d nauseam, while
persons with the wisdom and skill to suggest comprehensive remedies

and get them implemented will rarely be found.

So let the

criticisms stOp at this point, and before closing let us revert to
the question we started with.
The solution will not be giv√©n here, so that interested
readers may have the satisfaction of figuring it out for them-

selves.

What may be emphasised is that simple things like a

shower head need not be treated with contempt just because we
don't have a differential

equation to describe it.

In fact it

could be interesting if a B.Tecb. project involved designing
(inventing) an ordinary water tap which shuts off automatically
if the water supply stops.

The idea seems feasible enough since

forces like buoyancy can be used to trigger the desired effect.

If the device is simple enough it has commercial potential too.
