HOVER CRAFT AT I.T.rr.,

~ADRAS

The hover craft 'Rajani' wei:hs about half a ton and is powered by two
173 CC 7.5 bhp villiers Engines. During the brief tests at I. I. T. and at the airstrip
the craft carried a sIngle person at an average speed of about 15 k.rn.p.h.
Plans for the construction of the second Hovercraft at the laboratory are nearing
completion. The laboratory has already acquired one Jeep and two Tempo-Viking
Engines for the purpose. It is p1anned to construct a five-seater amphibian capable
.of high forward speeds. The structure will be of fibreglass/Aluminium. A theoretical
study into the princip1es of the Hovercraft and model studies are planned during the
course of the year. The Hovercraft team has two new entrants in Ramachandran and
Venkataraman besides Pradeepa who is expected to join us for a post-graduate course.

SPIRAIJ PEDESTRIAN OVERPASS LIN IOWA CITY, U.S.A.
Photograph, on the left shows the spiral span that forms final link of the
pedestrian overpass (composite welded steel girder bridge) across the Iowa State
Highway 218 and along the Burlington street in Iowa city. Dr. K. M. Kripanarayanan
(B. Tech. Civil 1965) participated in the design phase of the spiral section of this
project.
The design consists of a helicoidal concrete slab resting on steel columns that
.are carried to foundations restmg on solid rock. The concrete slab is 10' wide and 9i"
in thickness and is centered on a helicoidal radius of 17'. Powers, Willis and
Associates of Iowa City designed the total project for the Iowa State Highway
Commission. The consultant for the spiral section was Dr. Branson, D. E., of the
University of Iowa.
This structure recently won an award for structural design in the State of Iowa
