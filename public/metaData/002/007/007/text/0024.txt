They should be so organI~ed that the Ind ustrial trainmg is effectively
supervised and coordinated by the polytechnics and the industry.

4.

A placenaent and traming Officer and other staffs with sufficIent industrial.
background should be created in aU polytechnIcs.

S.

The curncula and contents and sequences of the industrIal training periods
of sandWIch courses should be carefully worked out by a body con~isllOg of
the Faculty of the Polytechnics, representatives from industry and
AcademIc Experts in the held.

6.

The duratlon of sandwich courses may not normally be less than three and
haif years. However, the polytechnics should have the freedom to
determIne the duratIOn, content, sequences and arrangements for the
sand wich courses WIthIn certain general guidelines and standards.

7.

Facilitles shoUld be provided for suitable residential accommodation to the
students during theIr training periods, where the ind ustry is situated within

traInmg penod the final assessment and evaluation should be made after the
completIon of the Industnal traming.

9. The success of sandwich courses is entirely dependent upon the close
collaboration and co-operatIOn of the industry and pol} technIcs. There is sufficient
indication that such co-operation will he forthcoming. However, to speed up the
involvemen.t of the industry, efforts must be taken by all concerned including the

The existing industrial apprentice trainIng act may be extended to include the training of diploma students.
