'Let it stand,' someone said of the
banyan tree as the site was being cleared for the
Hindustan .Lever Research Centre, at Andheri.
So the tree still stands-and it stands for
quite a lot. For one thing the tree signifies that
we can't easily get away from what is home-grown.
Appropriately, therefore, the Centre will tackle
problems rooted in India-the kind that can
only be solved here:
Can we discover and exploit hitherto unused
local sources of oil, thus cutting imports and saving
foreign exchange? Can we develop milk foods
that are ideally suited to Indian needs? How
can we improve the nutritive value of protein-poor
foods ?-Can we develop processes for the
preservation of Indian type fQod dishes?
Research on all this can only begin at home. It has,
at the Hindustan Lever Research Centre in Andheri.
The sweep and thrust of the studies are daring.
The scientists are producing new devices for
old, making traditional things happen in new ways.
They have, of course, left the banyan tree
alone to grow by itself.
