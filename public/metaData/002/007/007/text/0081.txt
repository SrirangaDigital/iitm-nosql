HARVEST

T. VARADARAJAN"

" It wa! a delicious summer m Jrning. The hazy shadows of the tr~es were still
long on the earth which seemed to have had a bath of the dew overnight. The silken
thread of the rays of the rising sun through the woods cast a golden shine on the
greens. in an attempt to devour the cool and sylvan setting and emitting warmth as the
hour grew. The chirpings of the birds from atop the blooming trees were vibrant
with youth and seemed to echo the pristine glory of Mother Earth in all her
manifestations" .

This is how one can commence his writing.
" The other day, the Secretary of the Alumni As~ooiation expto1ed a naxalite
bomb on me. 'You have to write an article for the Pradeep, be demanded. 'I will
collect it tomorrow, O.K.?' and he left. Well, I was quite unprepared for the onslaught.
Anyhow, now that there is no escape, I have decided to write, but am still wondering
what to write about ..â€¢ "
This is yet another way to start.
But I am not going to do either way.
Perhaps you may think that a man's w~rst difficulties begin when he is able to
do as he likes. I want to disprove this. Having decided to contribute to Pradeep
myself, it is going to be your worst difficulty if you dare to go through this to the end.
There is no doubt that Youth is a wonderful thing. But I do not understand
why it should be wasted on young<;ters. Having done that, one is obliged to agree
with the famous declaration of Mr. Pakeshere that the three stages of man are:

TRI- WEEKL Y

30 - 40:

TRY-WEEKLY

40 - 50:

TRY-WEAKLY

Recently I had a lively discussion with my friend who is a Chemical Engineer.
He has specialised in non-N~wtonian fluids and process dynamics while I am interested
in gardening and classical music. Therefore it was but natural that whenever we met
we used to talk about sociology with spt!cial reference to South Madras Tribes.
