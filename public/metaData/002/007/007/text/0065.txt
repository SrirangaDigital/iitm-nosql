Pentagon Parade
No report of the Convocation is complete without a mention of these objects ..
At a first glance, one make~ them out to be rather irregular; but then, they are
decorative. They come in two shades, pmk and blue, and are pa1nh;d up a few days.
before the Convocattoll. Wbtn the OAT is ngged up, and the pathways swept, one
finds th{m by the roadside weanng that \\ay-olJt, made-for-the-occasion look. Gone
are the d ay~ Vv hen flags of all COlOUfi used to dot the landscape by the dozen on such
a ceremonIOUS occaSIOn, alld the Engmeenng Unit must be gIven due credIt for
innovatIng an unIque, original and Imagmahve Vvay of decoratmg OAT. ConsIdering
the number of functIOns hdd thtre, It IS rather 1:lDfair on thea part to allow us such
a vlsual treat only once a )ear. 100 much, they 5ay, is cloymg, and our maroon
stage is a good example. The p~ntagons do look a sight better tban the rest of the
chryanthemums and It is a pIty tbat ever)one takes thtm for granted. But to the.
aestheticalJy-minded IITlan, it IS a long wait tIll the next ConvocatIon.
