Evaluation and Assessment
16.

The assessment of ~ student should be continuous and should be the
ultimate responsibility of teachers themc;elves. An immediate and complete

feasible in our present set up. To start with therefore, internal assesment
could be introduced as an adjunct to the Final examinations.

tests.

and grading for teachers in the form of short training programs, summer
