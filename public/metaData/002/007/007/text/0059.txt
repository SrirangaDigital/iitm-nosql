'TO ALL MY FRIENDS AT MADRAS'
Meka Papa Rao t

From the other side of the earth,
Far away from the place of my birth,
To remind you all, I write this verse,
Of a forgotten yet dear friend,
on this side of the Universe.
I think not of me a poet or a bard,

I write because to suppress a feeling is hard.
How much I much miss of you, alas t
Those lovely days at Madras!
The memories of all the nice time we had
Oh! .To think I'm missing you all is sad!
As the emotions run deep
The words become slow
And if I begin to weep
They cease to flow.
Oh! If only tears could write,
This page would be all wet and white
So. before the sadness condenses to a tear
may I wish you all,

my dear,

"A VERY VERY HAPPY NEW -YEAR*
AND MAY THE YEAR SEVENTY-ONE
BRING YOU PLENTY OF FUN"
As the distance between me and you is long

So I thought it would suit
If I say it with a J:oem or a song.
