After seven years of existence, the Alumni Association is still
to make any significant impact on the residents in the Campus- students
and staff. Many of them do not know of its existence (except from
information bulletins), some who know view it with indifference.
It is a sad fact that about 25% of the students who pass out of
the Institute do not care to join the Association.
A significant
percentage of those who join do so on some sort of cOlnpulsioo. This
is real sad state of affairs.
They say the Alumni Association serves as a so:;ial link between
an Alumnus and his Alma Mater. ]f that is so, everyone of the
students should join the Association out of his own will and pleasure.
The efforts of the Asso:;iation should be to inculcate in the
students an interest in its activities. In other words, the Association
should undertake, or participate in such activities as would make it
leave an impact on the social structure of the Campus.

There j s a gro\ving fear amongst many of us here, that the
Alumni Publication, Pradeep, may become another of the Institute
Publications with news about the Institute only. The highlights of
the activities of the Institute, there should be, but the news about the
alumni should find a more important place in this publication.
~Pradeep' should act as a forum for free exchange of thoughts and
experiences of the Alumni. For this, tlte co-operation of each one of
the Alumni is absolutely essential. This perhaps is a repetition of an
oft-repeated request.
