I am very glad that some of our alumni responded to our frequent requests and
sent us letters, articles, etc. The number of alumni who communicate with us t
however, is rather small and leaves much to be desired from the rest. I need not
emphasise on the need for members keeping in touch with the Alumni Associationthe only link between them and their Alma Mater.

I thank on behalf of myself and all of you the outgoing president and
Treasurer Prof. P. Venkat:a. Rao and Dr. BÂ· Ramaswami resp~ctively for the services
they have rendered to the Association.
My thanks are due to the President, Office-bearers and the alumni for their
co-operation and help. Thanks are also due to Mr. Varadarajan and Mr. Rajagopal
of the Alumni Placement Office. I will be failing in my duties if I do not place OD
record the services of the members of the Publication Committee.
The Alumni Association is still in infant stage. We are yet to achieve many of
our cherished aims and objectives. For the attainm~nt of thes~, a whole-hearted
participation of all the m~mbers of the A~socation is absolutely essential.
I hope
these would be realised in the coming years and that the Association will grow from
strength to strength.

"I musht be going crazy"
different answers! ".
