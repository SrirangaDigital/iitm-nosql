~ The growth of a Corporation can be measured by various yardsticks-financial :

~

**
**
*~

indices, production figures, sales turnover, new products and services, etc.

~

**
To us, in DCM, growth and devtlopment of our persoflnel is a significant

*~ yardstick...

***

*

We would like to compare the gIowth of an individual in an ~

~

organisation to the growth 01 a plant .. suffiCIent fresh air and water, proper :

:

soil conditions, right quantities of fertilizers, adequate sunshine and shade- :

*
*

'

these are vital for sturdy growth and beautiful bloom ... Thus in OCM, through
our comprehensive and integrated management development programmes on the

*~ one hand,

and systematic worker and mistry training activities on the other, we'

~

try to provide the right stimulus and the proper atmosphere for the growth and

~

development of our personnel.

** In
~

*~
*
~
~

a sense, therefore, it is right to say that in DCM, we try to grow our own

managers and trained perscnne] to meet problems of growth and change ... of new
products, of international marketing, of the computer, of setting up production
facilities, indeed, all the challenges of tomorrow.
