A FEW RETROSPEC1~IVE THOUGHTS ABOUT IITM
By
A. PARASURAMAN*

The other day I had been to I.I.T., Madras, almost a year after I had last
been there. However to my pJeasant surprise, as soon as I entered the campus I
found that memories about the good old Institute were stIll fresh in my mind.
Memories about the entertamment programmes, the O. A. T. movies, the debates, the
periodicals etc.,
came VIVIdly back lo my mmd.
I reaJised that almost
every event tbat took place at 1.1. T., Madras wIll remaIn treasured wIthIn me for a
long time to come. 1 am grateiul to the In~lllUle for the sound traming, at tImes
rather rough and tough: WhICh It gave me dunng the live years that I spent there. 1 am
,ure that my lIfe at l.l.T., Madras bas laId a sohd foundatIon whIch can- take up.
any weight that may come on It later on in my hfe.
However, among these pleasant thoughts lie scattered a few thoughts about
'what mIght have been' and 'what more I. I. T., Madras could have gIven me'. J do
have a few criticisms to offer about the system that was beIng adopted when I spent
my five years at I. I. T., Madras. The>e crllicJsms are based entirely on what I felt
about tbe system and anybody deslnng to dIsagree WIth me IS welcome to do so.
After all It has only been a year sInce 1 Jeft 1. 1. T., Madras and 1 may not be Â·com ...
peLent enough to comment on the system. However, I feel that I mus~ express my
feelIngs in words.
First of all, 1 felt that most, if not all the courses at lI.T., Madras were
,examinatIon-oriented'.
By tbiS 1 mean that most of the tOPICS were studIed by the
students WIth a VIew to answenng questions In the exanllnatlons rather than WIth a
VIew to thInkIng about theIr appll\.al10ns In real !Ife. f::.ven tbough the students are
partly to blame tor thIS, 1 teel that the method of teaching Itself IS such that there 1&
no Interest or Incenuve for tbe students to pursue In depth the practical applications
of what they study. It IS all very well to denve sophisticated equations or formulae~
However, for a useflll understandIng of a ~ubJe~i like englneenng I feel that it is the
apphcatlons ot these equatIOns and formulae to actual probltms rather than their
derivatlon, which is of importance.
If I am permllted to digress a bit, I have now completed one year at the
Indian Institute ot Management, Ahmedabad, where they follw the 'Case Method' ot
teachjng. The Case Method, In short, means that the various topic,; in management~
be It per~onnd. markeung Of any other area, are taught through dll)cus~lOn of real lIfe
problems in the r~spectlve areas, by the students. So the students at I. J. M.,.
Ahmedabad are supposed to be very much aware of the probleIlls In rt.a~ life rather
than in theory per see However, despite thiS fdct, from my own expenence and that
