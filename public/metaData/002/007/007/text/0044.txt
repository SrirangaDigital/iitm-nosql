The IITians who will remain in my memory for long are: Thomas Victor,
Lionel Paul, Rathincra Roy, Gopal Ramachandran, Murali and Jagadeesh. Their
names will go down in the history of lIT. The Campastimes, in spite of its shortcomings, was easily the best college paper and we will cherish for long the issue
"Seven years of Campastimes". Of course, the jokes of Sankar, Roy & Co. the bang
of the 'B-Tex' and the melody of Murali and Cash will be ringing in our ears for years
to come.
