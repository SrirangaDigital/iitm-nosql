GROUP Il

EDUCA1'lON AND TRt\1INING OF TECHNICIANS
General Reconnnendations
Throughout the discussions the autonomy and freedom of polytechnics, the
reform of examinations and industry- institute partnership were the recurring themes.
The group recognises that ultimately polytechnics should have freedom to develop
curricula to foster industrial partnership and to assess and evaluate theIr students~
All efforts must be made to develop polytechnics towards tbe ultimate standards
needed for autonomy. At the state le\oel there is a need for a body which will keep a
watch on standards of facuIty facIlities, and performance of polytechnics and to
maintain the standards of assessment and evaluation.
In view of the general importance of technician education at the national lever
it is recommended that a Technician Education Committee be constituted to advise the
A. I. C. T. E. on all matters relatmg to the development of technician educatIon in the
polytechnics. The functions of thIS CommIttee may be'.
a) to plan and keep under review the development of a unified national pattern
of technical education for technicians in industry and commerce.
b) to advise the A. I. C. T. E. on the establishment and development 0 1
suitable courses and the assessment of the standards of performance of
various institutions.
A Technician Education Committee may be constituted with not nlore than 15 to
20 person drawn from those lnterested in technlclan educatIon, experts from Industry
and commerce and representatIves of professionaJ bodies.

Specific Recommendations
(a) Diversification of Diploma Courses
I. The diversification of Industrial actIVities and the changing pattern of
technology demand technicians with greater depth of knowledge and skills in Gertain
areas. Hence diversification of courses within the broad branches of engineering and
provisIonal studIes is therefore essential.
2. Diversified courses may be int~oduced on the basis of SCIentIfic analysis of
1he needs of industry and of employment opportunities.
