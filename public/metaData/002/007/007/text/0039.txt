INSTITUTE'S ROLE IN DEVELOPl\1ENT OF
ENGINEERING EDUCATION
Dr. D. VENKATESWARLU*

Phenomenal progress has been made in the expansion of technical education
during the first three plan periods. But it is generally agreed that adequate attention
has not been paid to the quality of education. Standards of engineering education
depend upon curriculum, laboratory facilities and calibre of faculty members offering
the instruction. A new phase of activity during recent years at the Indian Institute
of Technology, Madras is the organisation of programmes (or the qualitative
improvement of engineering education.
The programmes organised by the Institute include the following:

1.

Sequential and advanced summer schools financed by the Indian Society
of Technical Education (ISTE), formerly the Association of the Principals
of Technical Institutions (APTI).

2.

Programmes of the Ministry of Education

3.

(a)

Technical Teachers' Training Programmo

(b)

Quality Improvement Programmes (QIP)

(c)

Curriculum Development

Other programmes.
