On our way to the restaurant I told my friend: ., No dou bt the strides ~cience
has made are magnificent. Why, even now when I read about the marvels of electricity it makes me stop and think!" My frIend lost no time in having a dig at me.
"Imagine that; isn't it wonderful what electricity can do 1 ".
At the restaurant the waiter, to our annoyance kept scratching his forearm and
when I asked him" Do you have eczema 1", he replied "No special orders Sir, just
what is on the menu".
We were not as much perplexed as the Sardarji in Delhi who did not have a
TV set, but drIlled a hole through his neigbboltr's apartment and watched wrestling
everynight until he found out that they had no TV set either.
