WELL DONE!
Mr. T. T. Jagannathan, who bagged the Sp~cial M!rit Prize of the Institute
in 1970, writes to his Professor:
"My apologies for not having written so long. I have been rather busy at
Cornell University, adjusting to the new system of education. However. I am now
-completely reconciled to the environment in the US, academic or otherwise.
You must be pleased to hear that I am doing extremely wdl at Cornell
University. I sincerely believe that after the training one receives in I. I. T., Madra~,
it is impossible not to do well in the U. S. All my friends from the Mechanical
Engg. Dept. distributed all over the States seem to be very w~l1 too and it is not
possible that this is a mere COincidence.

I have much to thank you and the other members of the Dept. and the Institute
for moulding me correctly in the difficult and important period of college education.
When I was in the Institute, I always felt that we were taxed more than necessary~
but now looking back I am t.hankful for the .training received there. I am very
proud of my Alma Mater and am sure that it will carve out for itself a place in
Indian History."
