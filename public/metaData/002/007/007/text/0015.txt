PROFESSOR M. G. K. MENON
Director, Tata Institute of Fundamental Research

Mambillikalathil Govind Kumar Menon, born on 28th August, 1928, received
the B. Sc. degree from Agra University in 1946, the M. Sc. degree from Bombay
University in 1949 and the Ph. D. degree from Bristol University in 1952. He worked
at the British University during the years ] 949·55. The scientists at Bristol were
primarily responsible for developing the now well-known nuclear emulsion technique
into a powerful tool for the study of cosmic rays, elementary particles and nuclear
phenomena. Prof. C. F. Powell, who headed this group, was awarded the Nobel
prize for Physics in 1950. Prof. Menon himself made a striking contribution to the
development of the techniques, particularly the use of stacks of stripped emul~ions and
methods of mass determination. The resulting findings on decay modes and
interactions of heavy mesons and hyperons are considered to be of great scientific
value.

During 1952-53, Prof. Menon was Research Associate at the University of
Bristol and from 1953 to 1955 he aeld the Senior award of the Royal Commission for
the Exhibition of 1851.
Since 1955, he has been with the Tata Institute of Fundamental l Research at
Bombay, as Reader (1955-58), Associate Professor (I 958-60), Professor -and Dean of
Physics Faculty (1960·64). Senior Professor and Deputy Director (Physics) (1964-66)
and Director since 1966. During this period, he has played an important role in the
development of the technology of fabricating and flying very large ballooas under
tropical conditions through the very low temperatures of the equatorial tropopause,
enabling cosmic ray investigations to be carried out at high altitudes close to the geomagnetic equator; and in cosmic ray studies' deep underground (Kolar Gold Fields).
The neutrino experiment conducted at a depth of 2i Km below the earth's surface led
to the first unambiguous observation of the interaction of a natural neutrino.
Prof. Menon has written over 60 scientific papers. During the period of his
work at the TIFR, he has provided leadership in a wide range of scientific activities
and is chiefly responsible for the international reputation that this Institute enjoys as
a Centre of research.
Prof. Menon received Shanti Swarup Bhatnagar award in 1960. The Government of India honoured him in 1908 by bestowing the Padma Bhushan on him. Last
year, he was elected a Fellow of the Royal Society of London. He is the seventeenth
Indian to become the recipient of this coveted distinction.
