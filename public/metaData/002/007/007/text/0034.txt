(d) Industrial Engineering: Education and Research:
It was- observed that facilities for training in industrial engineering are totally
inadequate considering the needs of the country. As against one industrial engineer
for every 50 employees available in some western countries, if we were to consider even
one industrial engineer for every 1,000 employees in our country, we will need several
thousand industrial engineers. At present not even fifty industrial engineers pass out
of our institutions annually. Therefore it is proposed that

(a)

industrial engineering subjects should also be offered at under-graduate
level;

(b)

at post-graduate level also industrial engineering program.
offered and where existing it should be expanded;

(c)

research and dJctoral work should also be initiated; and

(d)

funds should be provided for the development of standards, teaching
materials, and for writing books.
