a>nfess that this report will, in no way, be different from those in previous years, but

Membership:
About 75% of the students who passed out this year joined the ranks of the
Association taking the membership figure past the two thousand mark. The number
of new members is about 280 as against 360 last year. Many reasons could be
advanced for this downfall.
i)

Scrapping of the 3-year B. Tech. pegree Course

ii)

"What do we get if \\e join" attitude of graduands.

iii)

Our own inability to create sl..fficient interest among the graduands in the
activitIes of the AssociatIon.

Many steps including making the membership compulsory \\-as thought of; but
no concrete steps in this regard could be taken.

0/ the Alumni:
A number of our alumni got geod positions in top Industries. in India through
the good offices of the Alumni Placement Section.
