-could do an entire chapter on this annual gaJa. I don't know what the three-day
binge is in aid of. One very original thinker has claimed that new talent finds
inspiration there. If the inter-bostel affair js any measure of IITian talents, it's

But he would finish. I I guess that's what helped me in life' he mused later. ' You
-could call me self-made.'
Letter to the Editor

It is not too late and deathÂ·bed repentance is no good. Let us not waste any more
