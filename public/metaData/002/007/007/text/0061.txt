1.

In the beginning there were - 4 coconuts.

Let us see how neatly this works

out.
The first sailor approaches the pile of -4 coconuts, throws a positive coconut to
the monkey (it does not matter whether the monkey is given his coconut before or
after the division into fifths) ~thus leaving five negative coconuts. These he divides
into five piles with a negative coconut in each. After he has hidden one pile, four
negative coconuts remain - exactly the same number that was there at the start! The
other sailors go through ;the same ghostly, ritual, the entire procedure ending with
each sailor in possession of two negative coconuts, and the monkey, who fares-best in
this inverted operation, scurrying off happily with six positive coconuts.

2. The diameter of the log makes no difference. Let x
boy travelled.

=

number of feet the

Use the Pythagorean formula:
x~

= 84 + ]32

Xfol

= 7056

X2

= 7225

x

= 85

2

+

169

The boy travelled 85 feet.

3. Before aDd After
1.

The one you did after the one you did before this one IS this one.

In

other words:
2.

" ...... the rpuzzle you solved after you solved the ~uzzle you solved before

you solved this one" 1S this one.

3.

Hence the question may be rephrased this way: " If the puzzle you solved
before this one was harder than THIS ONE, was the puzzle you solved before this one
harder than THIS ONE?"
Obviously the answer to this question is just YES.
