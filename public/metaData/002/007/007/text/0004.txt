MESSAGE

Since I sent the message for the 3ixth annual number of the "Pradeep

H,

two

important events have taken place in India which could have a vital bearing for the
future of the alumni of our Engineering Institutions.

In the first place, the elections that took place in February-March this year have
given an impressive majority to the party of the Prim~ Minister.

This has eliminated

the one great fear which many of us had in our minds, viz,' the spectre of ins/ability at
the centre.

{rrespective of wheth~r one agreed or not with the totality of Smt. Indira

Gandhi's programme, one had the assurance that the country knew where it stood and
could go ahead with the assurance ofstabihty in the central authority.

Unfortunately the scene has been darkened by threatening cluuds from East
Bengal.

The Bangia Desh crisis is a crisis full of unknown danger,; no man can

predict how this crisis will affect India in the next few years.
This is the background against which the young alumni from the I. /. T. Madras
have to "Shape the pattern of their future.

They are not free agents,' and their fortunes

will be buffet ted by unknown dangers.

But, with these dangers are associated equally

impressive challenges.

I am sure the young people graduating from the I. I. T., will

meet these challenges with courage, fortitude and loyalty to the country.
