and other benefits for continuing their educatipn. There is a growing realization among industrialists that ultimately they are the ones who are going to benefit from inventions or discoveries
made in the University laboratories, and there is a realisation among Professors that they will
have to justify the millions doled out to them by producing something useful to the economy.
Of course, it is not my intention to give the impression that I am in favour of copying
every thing that exists in V.S. universities. But certainly there is every reason to adopt what
we think would be beneficial to us. As the unrest in V.S. and European Universities has
shown, their educational system too lacks certain essential ingredients, and in fact they might
be able to solve some of their problems by giving Â·more importance to some of the values that
we cherish. Perhaps the enormous surge in popularity of Ravi Shanker, Ali Akbar and
Maharishi Mahesh Yogi is a manifestation of this realization on their part. One thing is
certain-the East and West can no longer remain isolated. Modern strides in communication
has seen to that. In the future, we are going to be studying each other and borrowing ideas
from each other. If only we borrow what is good for us and reject what is not, this world
would be a much better place to live in.
