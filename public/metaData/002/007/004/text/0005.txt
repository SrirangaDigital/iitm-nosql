MESSAGE "

To my young friends,
In spite of uncertainties at present, one can see attempts to
create a new system that will Â·utilise our untapped resources, profi t
by large-scale organisation and give greater benefits to the common
man. To reach the take off stage is a long and rough road. Great
opportunities lie ahead for you all though disguised as inscluble
problems. I have no doubt that alumni of this Institute will tackle
them squarely and successfully.
