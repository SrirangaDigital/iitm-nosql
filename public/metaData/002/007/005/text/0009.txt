Editorial
Pradeep, we were told by our friends who visited us recently, makes an
interesting reading. We innocently believed that and renewed our efforts to
make it more interesting.

Mr. STikant has chosen to write about his pet topic-birthdays of
ladies. You may wonder how he knows so much about the intimate details
of ladies. It is a secret. If, after going througb a number of quotations
from famous writers, novelists and essayists, you doubt whether they are so
intelligent and witty as they, judging from their quotations, seem to be and
try to verify their authenticity, we request you not to do so You know why
Dr. Gopichand is a disciplined man. So naturally we expect that his
article wilJ be on discipline. His clear analysis of the ills of the nation will
be helpful to many.
Mr. Karthik can rightly be called the critic's critic. In his essay 'Hail
the Critic', he puts forth his ideas clearly and we believe that there won't be
any criticism on his article!
Persons who know Gautam Mahajan personally will be surprised to
find tbat his article 'Chicago Goes' is brief. Mahajan is, to borrow a journalistic term, our stringer, a part-time correspondent. We are sure that you will
appreciate his style.
The problem of unemployed engineers is dealt with by Prof. Sampath
in his article.
'
We wish to hear your review of the article 'Views and Interviews'.
Coming from a person with literary talents and vast knowledge of
business administration and industrial engineering, the essay" On Career
Planning" points out the facts which everyone wants to forget conveniently.
With 'NewsÂ·flash from the DepartmenW', Alumni Directory and other
interesting informations, we think Pradeep serves the intended purpose.
We appeal to all the members to maintain contact with the Alumni
Association and keep it informed of the latest news so that we can do better
service.
We wish everyone a bright future.
