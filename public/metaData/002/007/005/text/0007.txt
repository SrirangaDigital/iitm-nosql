My young friends,
Creative ideas or achievements can not be measured by the same
units

as those of absorbing capacity us'Ually tested by a written

examination.

Ability to reproduce the words of others may be

creditable but this is not to be compared with devising new solutions
to problems.

Unless one acquires the desire to do things indepen-

dently, one is not aware of the scientific spirit which demands new
know/edge through independent investigation.
