To be able to Crt tlclse constructively is a challenge to communica tion skills. When
any communcation criticises, the self-centeredness, which is the greatest single barrier to any
form of communication, can become almost impenetrable. Constructive criticism must
permit change in methods without admissIOn of wrong, rather than spark defence from the
criticised. If one cares to stop and consider before criticising, it is quite likely that irritation win be dispersed, if not depleted. For example, "Why the hell did you do that" may
well be replaced by "I wonder whether that was the best way of doing it."
There may be numerous motivations for criticising. The critic may want to show off

economic success. Friends of mine (ex IITians), who work in this country tell me that the
workers are slightly worse than in India, and that everyone takes things easy. Whether this
is true at the higher executive levels, I doubt very much.
