Dear

Delegate~

Much as we would like to roll out the red carpet and let the din of brass bands drown
our cheers of welcome, our hands are tied. I. 1. Tians are essentially humble hosts who hate
to make a show of anything. OU.r welcome springs from the depths of our hearts and is
innocen tly reflected in our benevolent looks and noble deeds. An iota in our efforts to make
your stay here a comfortable and memorable one, is this pocket companion. It contains
simple so]utiol1 to your possible non-technical problems on the Campus.

Madras recently.
