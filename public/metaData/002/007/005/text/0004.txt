Ever)Â·time I visit the campus of the Indian Institute of Technology, at
Guindy, my mind goes back to the days when I was myself a student at the
Central College, Bangalore.

This, I am horrified to recollect, was half a

century ago. In that college, our numbers were small. Our teachers were
dedicated; but none of them, except for a couple who were expatriates, had
had the advantage of meeting distinguished scientists overseas or working in
lahoratories abroad. The equipment in our laboratory was pretty rudimentary.
By contrast,. we have in the I.l.T. first class equipment and we have teachers
with high academic qualifications, most oj whom have had the advantage of
lVorking in great universities or research institutions overseas. The contrast,
however, is much more striking when the student leaves the campus. The
Indian world outside the campus is infinitely more difficult to day than it was
in In)' time. The political situation is confused; the country's economy is
barelr able to show its head after a severe recession; and employment
opportunities, in relation 10 the vastly increased nwnber of students, restricted
Altogether, the times are more difficult and, therefore, more challenging.
1 am sure that, with the advantage of a first class training in the I.l.T.
supplemented by a disciplined mind and a robust heart, the students of the
Institute will playa worthy part ;n the future of our country.
