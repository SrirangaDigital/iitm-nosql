for Technical Education to advise it on the Improvement and co-ordinated development
of technical education at the national level. It also appointed a Scientific Man-Po\oVer
Committee in 1947 for the purpose of assessing and forecasting the requirements of various
categories of scientific and technical personnel in the con text of the coun t r)' 's economic
growth.
The latter Committee visualized a pattern of economic development for the decade
1947-57 and estimated the man-power need, for this ten-year period, to be 30,000 persons
possessing first degrees in various fields of engineering and technology and 33,000 diplomaholders. The Committee outlined various measures to reach this goal.
It is of interest to note that doubts were raised in certain quarters about this estimate
on the ground that the country's economic development was unlikely to proceed on a scale
as large or as speedily as envisaged by the Committee.

In 1947, engineering institutions in the country had an admission capacity for 3000
students per year for first degree Courses and polytechnics for 3,700 for diploma Courses.
By the end of the First Plan Period (1956), these capacities had risen to 6000 and 10,500
respectively. Those who formulated the Second Five Year Plan proposed tha t the admission
capacities should be stepped up to 7,400 and 13,000 respectively. At this time, many voiced
the feeling that this order of technical man-power would be wholly inadequate for the imple~
mentation of the various planned projects. An Engineering Personnel Commi ttee, appointed
by the Planning Commission, gave its finding in May 1956 that about 26,000 diploma-holders
would be the minimum need by 1960-61. The targets were revised twice during the Second
Plan period, and, by 1961, the admisson capacities had risen to 14,000 first-degree students
and 26,000 diploma-studen t8. The annual output in t 96l rose to 6000 from 1300 in 1947, in
respect of engineering graduates, and to 8000 from 1450 in 1947, in respect of diplomaholders. No serious shortages of technical personnel were anticipa ted during the Third Plan
Period. To meet the Fourth Plan requirements, it was proposed to increase the admissions
to 20,000 for graduate Courses and 40,000 for diploma Courses and to provide all over the
country the requisite institutional facilities and support. In 1962, the Govl. of India established an Institute of Applied Man Power Research that would conduct research into the
nature, characteristics and utilization of human resources in India, provide a perspective of
the national requirements of trained man-power and evolve a plan for the improved training
and development of the available work~force, and techniques for the educa tional preparation
for employment, vocational guidance etc.
If one takes an over-all view, there has been no dearth of Committees, Councils and
Commissions or critical appraisals and clear statements of our aspirations. But something has
gone wrong in our implementation of schemes. Not a day passes withou t the newspapers
speaking of the acute state of unemployment of graduates and diploma-holders. To-day's
estimate is that there are around 56,000 engineering graduates and 75,000 diplomaholders desparately looking for jobs. The Labour Minister in the Central Government makes
this ominous declaration: "The number of educated unemployed is rising fast. The
employment opportunities are not rising fast enough".
The malady is a deep one and calls for heart-searching and a reappraisal of our
fundamental attitudes.
In an address delivered in 1966, Dr. Atma Ram, Director-General of the COl1DCil
of Scientific and Industrial Research, drew attention to the inadequate rapport between
