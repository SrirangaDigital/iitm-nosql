A Study by Associate Dean Lauress L. Wise.
- Stanford Engineering News, No. 48.
November, 1964.
More than 50 per cent of the students who enter Stanford University in engineering
as freshmen ultimately graduate in Engineering. Another 29 per cent that enter in
Engineering successfully graduate in some other field.
The study involved freshmen who entered in 1953, 1955 and 1958. The average
number of engineering freshmen during those years was 256. Out of this group 76 (or 30
per cent) graduated in EngLneering at the end of four years. Another 54 (or 21 per cen t)
graduated during their fifth year, and 4 more graduated during the sixth year.
Most of those who transferred to some other field did so during their freshmen or
sophomore year. Their graduation pattero closely parallel led that of students who
remained in Engineering.
