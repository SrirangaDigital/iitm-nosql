As you are aware the Faculty Association of our Institute, comprising of all academic staff
and some other instructional staff as well, has been in existence since the inception of our Institute. This association has been dealing with the social and recreational activities of the staff till
the year 1965, and thereon, with the coming-up of the other associations like the Staff Club, etc.
with specified sectors of activities, this association has been mainly concentrating uPOJ? matters
pertaining to the academic activities of the Institute. The high-ligh t of this year was the seminar
on A suitable scheme of examination for the undergraduate course'. The cons~nsus of opinion
was that the year has to be divided into two terms, there being one terminal examination at the
end of each term, one mid-term examination and one periodical examination. This scheme takes
into account the proper appreciation of the knowledge gained by the student, the proper evaluation of the teaching standard and a reduction in the existing number of periodical and other
examinations actually in force at present. The Association hopes to take up similar problems
and bestow its attention on them.

There have been distinguished visitors entertained by the Faculty, like Dr. Burks of the
University of Michigan from the United States, Dr. Taraev and Dr. Butaev from Moscow,
Dr. Hilbig of the Technical University of Berl~n from West Germany and Shri M. C. Chagla, our
Union Education Minister.
In order to make the deliberations and activities of the association more effective, particularly in the scheme of instruction as well as in the inculcation of professional sense into our
boys, suggestions are most welcome from our old boys who may be engaged in different spheres
of activities all over the coun try and abroad.
