cular, from the point of view of educationists, and in the light of the data presented and
recommendations made in the LA.M.R. Paper referred to above. The main conclusions, that
emerge from the analysis made here using the figures pertaining to the I.I.T., Madras as the
frame-work, will, it is believed, be applicable to the other I.I.Ts. and several engineering
institutions in the country.

Record of the I. I. T., Madras
The flow-pattern of the first three batches of students admitted to the five-year B. Tech.
Degree course at this Institute is sketched in the diagram at next page. The diagram is selfexplanatory showing as it does the progression of each batch of students from year to year; it
indicates the drop-outs at various stages as well as the number of those who failed in a given
year and joined the next year's stream, and those who failed a second time and joined the third
group of students. For anyone set of entrants, one can read off from the chart, the number of
those who graduated within the minimum stipulated period of 5 years, those who took six years
to complete the requirements, those who took seven years, and so on.
The following observations would appear to be in order:
(i) Most of the students, who discontinue, do so in their first two years of study. Out
of the 375 students freshly admitted to the I.I.T'J Madras during the years 1959,
1960 and 1961, 18 left in one year and 19 in two years. 13 out of the former
left in the early part of the first year of study and may be presumed to have
joined other institutes/colleges which were nearer their homes or offered them seats
in courses of their choice.
(ii) The number of students dropping out during the last three years of study is
negligible.
(iii) The percentage of passes at every stage is uniformly high, as the following
tabulation will show.

*Anticipated figures based on the experience of the last few years.

The rate of failure is generally high during the first three years of the B. Tech. degree
course and is attributable to the students' inadequacy in the background knowledge of basic
science subjects, want of aptitude and, in some cases, a disinclination to take interest in subjects that have a practical content. At the third year level, where specialisation in a particular
branch of technology commences, the failure of students usually stems from a wrong choice of the
branch and the ensuing difficulties encountered in adjustment. It is noteworthy that a large
proportion of stud en ts in this category manage to complete the course after lagging behind by a
year, and drop-outs from among these are a rare occurrence.
