The Gymkhana
The Gymkhana has been, for the past year, as active as ever. The Institute teams have,
as usual, bagged most of the quiz and debating trophies in the city. It looks as though there
will never be a lack of talent here and the Alumni, wherever they are) can be sure that their
successors are as good as they were. Not content with winning the usual trophies, the
Gymkhana has initiated what they call tt Social Service and External Relations" which,
whatever they might mean, have started making a lot of noise under the first Secretary,
Madhusudhan Menon.
The Rowing Team did it again, they beat the Madras University. Another field where
I.LT. Gymkhan.a has made its mark is music. Yes, music! Our Institute Orchestra, the
Beat-x (naturally), beat all corners in a music competition in the city. This has led to the
sprouting of another strong music group which is slowly gaining popularity.
All in all the Gymkhana had a glorious year-as usual.
