MESSAGE

Another year has gone by since the last number of PRADEEP was published,
and more graduates have come out of the cloistered seclusion of the I.I.T. into the
difficult and confused stream of life.
Some of them, following previous pattern, will continue academic studies for
a further period, either in India or abroad; some will obtain jobs overseas, and many
in India; and a few (I hope very, very few) will find their own placement difficult
for a time. I have especially in mind the latter two categories of graduates. To them,
I can hold out no very rosy prospects. They will find plenty of frustrations. But
the task before the country, in which they will be participating, will be a challenging
one, and on whether that is well done or not will depend the future of India. If they
will apply to their task the qualities they have learnt at the I.I.T., discipline, team
spirit, and a capacity for learning and applying skills, the future will undoubtedly
be a bright one.
