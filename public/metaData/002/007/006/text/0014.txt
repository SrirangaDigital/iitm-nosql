E.ditorial
Let us not mince words in expressing our sense of disappointment at the lack of
enthusiasm on the part of the alumni in communicating to us their e"periences since they had
left the Instltute campus. The wide amphitheatre of life should have surely drawn them to
act out their roJes, willy nilly, in this our brief but exacting world. The readers of Pradeep
would have been immensely happy to share their thoughts together even as a majority of them
dreamed their dreams together in their campus community life. However, this gap has been
admirably filled by Dr. T. Gopichand, our never-failing source of thoughtful and thought..
provoking contributions. His essay on "My Teachers," we hope will stlmulate a few of our
alumni to contribute, at least in the future, to Pradeep some such article as "The Teachers
that Never Learn." Mr. C. V. Rammohan's witty sketch is reflective of our technological
civilization. His ulysses could be anyone of us. To efr on the safe side, give a wide berth
to Robots, Kind Looking or not.
Mr. Ramaswamy's grievance is obvious. We do not editorially share his views, but
sympathise with him in his concern for values in life. But, since an editorial is not a review, we
advise our readers to relax with Pradeep now, and write to us ~ hatever they feel later.
