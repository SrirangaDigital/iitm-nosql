The Executive Committee in its last meeting has taken into
consideration the heavy cost of printing and has expressed the
opinion that particulari of those Alumni that have once been
published in the previous issues of 'Pradeep' need not appear .again.
As per this decision, the particulars of the Alumni passed out
in the year 1969, only, will appear in this issue of Pradeep. It is
however proposed to publish separately a directory giving particulars
of the Alumni every five years. If anyone needs the particulars of
the students of previous batches, they can contact the Alumni
Association who will readily furnish the same to them.
