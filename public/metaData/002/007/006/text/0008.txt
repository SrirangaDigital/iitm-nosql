MESSAGE

The profession of Engineering is the practice of an art whereby the forces and
the meterials of nature are directed to use for the benefit of mankind. An engineer can
have a perfectly good conscience, fully satisfied that he is a benefactor to humanity
for producing cheaper and better consumer goods. There is however a danger at the
present time tqat such myopic self satisfaction amounts almost to blindness.
, Modern technology has made today's large cities possible but engineering
research has yet to evolve means for living in them comfortably. The most urgent
problems of physical environment control today are transportation, air and water
pollution, noise, land utilisation and health. Action is imperative to augment the
substantial contributions that scientists and engineers have already made to Society. I
am confident that the alumni of this Institute will playa significant role in meeting these
challenging tasks.
