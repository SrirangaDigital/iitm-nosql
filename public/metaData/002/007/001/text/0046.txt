secret councils of the Government by Henry Tizard, who had
earli~r been Scientific Adviser to the U. K. Government and was the
principal architect of Britain's defence Radar System. Tizard was
no longer in authority, but Lindemann was and he had the friend ..
ship and unquestioning support of the Prime Minister. Tizard's
views were brushed aside, and in an atmosphere characterized by a
hypnosi.s of power, as it were, a secret decision was made and
acted upon in a crisis. Soow contends that, if the controversy had
been referred to the Fellows of the Royal Society or to a General
Council of professional scientists, Lindemann's moves would have
been disapproved. Eut as if:> the case with the making of all secret
choices, this was not done. It is a remarkable feature of modern
conditions that such choices are made by a handful of men under
a shroud of secrecy. The choices are cardinal, in the sense that thpy
have a powerful effect on whether Society stands or moves towards
its doom. Snow's conclusion is:
I'It is dangerous to have a scientist sitting in pOVler, with
no scientists neaL" him, surrounded only by those who think of
him as all-wise, all-knowing. The world should never again
give any single seientist the powers of choice that Lindemann
had:'

In all countries whose citizens subscribe to the ideal of the
welfare of the human race, it is essential thai there be a General
Council of Scipntists. 8, ~ch a Council should have the sanction of
public opinion behind it and shall be above Government and Legislature in the sense in which the Supreme Judiciary of the country
is above these. In this council, men of distinction and objectivity
will consider the cardinal choices before the nation and reach conclusions, in the true spirit of Science and without pressuree of any
kind. Then Science may come into its own and the dilemma
resolved beyond doubt.
