College with students talking in terms of ' buttering' , crow catch..
ing' (kakafying) and similar terms.
If the principles of democracy, of social and intellectual
equality, are upheld by the academic community there is no
reason why familiarity coupled with deep understanding ~hould not

Dr. C. Rama Sastri:
As far as instruction and contact are concerned, they should
mainly be confined to the class-room. The rest of the le;)rning
depends as to how the individual grows in the atmosphere - ....
The position of the teacher should be that of an observer
seeing bow the student fails and succeeds and occasionally come
to his rescue if the situation is alarming-A close relationship
should not exist between a teanhel" and a student. The dignity
'of .the staff member is affected to some extent by establishing
social equality with the student. A certain distance is good and
helps to provide a better attitude for learning.
