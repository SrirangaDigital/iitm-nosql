On the happy birthday of c. Pl'adeep ", our Alumni Annual, it is
my fervent hope that it should light up the paths of those who
leave the Institute portals for the wide world thai greets them not
only with the warmth of welcome but also the call of Challenge.
In the midst of all the turmoil, trials and tribulations that
beset our country, let the Alumni remind themselves of their
solemn pledge:
Sahanavavatu Sahanau Bhunaktu
Saha Veeryam Karavavahai
Tejeswinavad hi tamastu
Let the .A.lumni and the Alma Maier come closer, Let us all
pull together as success comes wi th a smile only to those who are
united by the fraternity in life, thought and action.
