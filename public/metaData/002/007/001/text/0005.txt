PRADEEP
FIRST ANNUaL NUMBER]

l

APRIL 2, 1965

When the idea of publishing this magazine was first mooted,
one of the questions that arose was whether this magazine would
be just one more to the list of already existing I. 1. T. pu blications

viz. the Annual magazine, the Convocation brochure and the
Campastimes. At the outset we wish to emphasize that this
magazine does not alnl to enter the field of ienet alliterattH e.. It
is not a competitor to any existing publication. The Pradeep tries
to bring the graduates of I.LT. Madras into closer contact Wit-Il
their Alma Mater through its pages. It is chiefly designed to be
a . brochure for circulation among graduates informing tb~m of
events happening at I. I. T., and of what is going on in the outside
world which is of concern to the welfare of 1- I.T. It will carry
contributions from alumni as weB as from the staff members here,
In short, these pages will contain the story of LI.T., which is absorbing because it deals not only with the past but also with the
present and future - - those who are here now and those who al'e
yet to come. This is the story which we are privileged to relate in
the pages of Pf'adeep.
Almo~t

everyone has his own idea of what a publication like
this should contain. We invite suggestions as to how this
magazine should be run. Any suggestions on what material to
include and in w hat form would be welcome- We hope that nlany
of the alumni would )write to us as to what they want and what
they can do without.
