plines give. All the branches of discipline have the same endSARVA SASTRA PRA.YOJANAM-ATHMA DARSANAM, In5light into reality is the end of all kinds of discipline, whether they
are scientific or humanities or technological-It is my earnest hope
that you will not fall victims to the tendency to view science and
humanity as two diversified disciplines and feel that you ara
engaged in two different and unrelated pu:rsuits.

All truth must be regarded as one whole-whether you practise
this discipline or that. Your supreme aim must be to pursue truth.
It is that wbich makes the human being dignified and civilised. If
you are able to do it, then you become a really ciyilised human
being. It is my earnest hope that this first set of graduates who
go out from this Institute of Technology, will set an example to
others in never using their knowledge to unworthy ends but using
it for the betterment of humanity, for the education of the human
race and for making this world a true human fellowship.
Thank you.
