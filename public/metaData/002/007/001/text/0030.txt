We won the first round in Basket- ball against Delhi but lOlt in the
semi-final to Bombay, who played a more impressive game. In the
hard fought out final, Bombay outplayed Kharagpur who had
bagged the trophy in the previotls years, All interest was focussed
on Hockey where the home team met Kharagpur in the final.
The exchanges were even and Kharapur took the initial lead.
The home team's undying efforts to equalise paid rich divi. .
dends when a goal was scored in the closing minutes of the same.
Extra time provided was of no avail. The teams entered the field
for a second tim~, the next morning. Kharagpur had the better of
exchanges this time and eventually won the match by a solitary
goal.
The five 1. 1. TI. got themselves placed in the order of seniority
in which they were established. Congratulations to Kharagpur
who emerged victorious for the third time in succession. On the
3Lst evening, the prizes and trophies were distributed by Dr. A. L.
Mudaliar in a colourful ceremony held in the stadium. The curtain
was drawn later in the evening bringing the meet to a close.
The Inter 1. I. T. meet has come and gone. But it leaves
be hind the 8weei memories in the hearts of one and all in our
campus.
