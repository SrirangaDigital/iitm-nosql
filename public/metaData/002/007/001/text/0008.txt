Dr. D. \Tenkateswarlu, speaking on the occasion, faid that the
advantage of forming an Association of this type was two-fold in
that it helps the alma mater to know about and be proud of the
performances of the alumni in the outside world and in that the
alumni might like to come back to the 1. I· T. to work in highly
specialis~d fields. De. Venkateswarlu also envisaged the possibili ty
that in the distant future, the Association, like the well-established
Associations elswhel'e, may publish periodica1 journals dealing with
campus news and trends and developments in the variOl s fields of
leal·ning. The Association may conduct seminars and short term
course-s for the benefit of the Alumni, open local sections at
important industrial centres for helping new graduates and so on.
