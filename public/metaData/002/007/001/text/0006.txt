Department of Chemistry,
Indian Institute of Technvlogy,
Madras-36.
Dear Alumni,
It delights me immensely to greet you with tmis first issue of
your OWIJ. magazine-the PRA.OE~P. Pra.dee9--what a lovely
name. Guess who suggested it: Our beloved Patron, Professor
Sengupto, of course.
PRADEEP stands for the beautiful lan1p that's in the
Institute's emblem. By carrying the some motif into the emblem
of the Alumni Association, we reinforce the thought you, the
Alumni, are still a part of the Insititue and that the kindly light
that illumined your minds, guided your laboul's ani lifted your
thoughts when you were at the institute, is still with you to shed
lustre on your further pursuits.

As the pre3iding member of the Eiitorial Committee it is not
for me to express an opinion on this, our filÂ·Rt issue of P a.A.DEEP,
or to pay tributes to th3 people who were mainly responsible for
bringing it out on s~hedllie. Wha~ is more important is what you
think about. If you think that it could have been better, I would
entirely agree with you, for I can sense YOLlr ego thac makes you
expeot the very best in every thing that CJmas frJm your Alma
Mater. You have a right to feel that way, Let me assure you
that we shall certainly bear that in mind and do better in our next
effort, for which we shall need your cooperation too.

(Saba Viryam Karavavahi)
-that's the motto given by our Patron to the Alumni. So let us
striva together-to make PRADEEP reflect more fully the lustrous
glory of our Alma Mater.
Most sincerely yours,
M. V. O. Hasty';'.
President
Alumni Association
