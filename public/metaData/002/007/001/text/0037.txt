FIRST ANNUAL NUMBER

This is something which beats me, especially with our background,
it is one or the otlHw. So we take to our books, since to a void
all temptation the safest way is to be away from the source. This
way of relaxing completely during the week-end and then back
to studies again is something thE1Y learn right from sch 01; but
don't worry, you'll learn it by the second semester. Those of our
students who think they can do it right away try and sink. If
you ask me, never enter the water without learning to swim.
By now I must be sounding like a pseud~-philosopher myself.
In fact after reading all this amateur stuff one might be led to
think that to me our country looks inert. If that was so I would
not have bothered to write. I can feel the restlessness, and the
change even from here, probably better from here like the round.
ness of the earth can be seen better from a satellite. Perhaps
distance lends enchantment to the view but it is true that one
understands and appreciates his country better when he goes abroad.
The westernization of India, as Rome would prefer to call it, is
the talk here among Indian students as well as interested Americans. How much of western ideas should India absorb is a much
debated topic, As people who prefer the golden mean (our mixed
. economy being an example), we will probably westernize half way,"
Our sense of moderation, our acceptance of certain socialistic
principles for public welfare, our principles of non-alignment,
are things for which we could pat ourselves on the back, though
the Americans confess they fail to appreciate the wisdom in it.
Here's for a better India.
