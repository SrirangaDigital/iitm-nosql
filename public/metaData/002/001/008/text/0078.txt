It is gratifying to note that the Government of India is contemplating tho
introduction of Physical Education as a compulsory class room subject in schools
and colleges-and why not? Is it not based on the sciences of psychology,
psychia try, sociology. Is not the physical educationist entitled to as square a
deal as other members of the teaching staff.
On your verdict hangs the lives of thousands of young men and womeu
graduating from schools and colleges all over the country with every possibility
of being a skilled barbarian, ill-equipped and unprepared to meet a crisis in life
just because many with a wave of the hand brushed aside physical education and
relegated it to a position of secondary importance or of no importance at all!
What is your verdict?
