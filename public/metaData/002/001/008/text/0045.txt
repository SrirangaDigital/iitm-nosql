devised to attract that very prurient interest that the Government seeks to
avoid! Even the censor board has betrayed an utter lack of taste or tact. Every
foot of the film that is cut incites in the minds of the audience a thousand feet of
possibilities and permutaions. These a!Jrupt gaps in the film are more vulgar in
their suggestiveness, in their implications, than the actual scene could ever have
been.
A much quoted dramatist wrote, "There is nothing good or bad in the
world. it is thinking that makes it so." Profarnity and obscenity exist only
in the minds of men, not in magazines, not in films, not in words. It is there
that it must be judged, and by the individual, not in courts and censorboards by
demagogic moral societies and government lawyers.
