The students of the V/5 and 111/3 Chemical Engineering visited the Ashok
Leylands Limited, and the K. C. P. Limited, during the course of this year to
familiarize themselves with production techniques employed there.

Engineering classes accompanied by Dr G. S. Davies, and Dr Durga Prasad Rao,

stay in Ernakulam the students visited FACT, Premier Tyres, Travancore Cements,
Indian Aluminium Company Limited, Indian Rare Earths Limited, Tata Oil
Mills, Cochin Refineries, Oagle Works. The tour was very fruitful and gave
a very sound idea of the working conditions in Indian industries.
