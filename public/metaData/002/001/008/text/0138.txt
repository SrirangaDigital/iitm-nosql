Mr. Jaikumar was nominated the first member of the club. We are pleased to

tion to Mt. Sasir Kangri, the highest un climbed peak in the world (25000 ft). This
expedition is to be carried out this summer.
The various activities of the club included hiking, cycling, rock climbing,
etc. There were in all fourteen trips made during the year. We congratulate
Mr. Gopal Ramachandran for his wonderful performance of cycling, from Poona
to Bangalore.in ten days. Mr. KabHan also deserves mention for his improvising a
rexine table cloth for a tent and using it in Ooty during this winter (4Â°C). He
hitch-hiked for about 400 miles, covering Mysore, Nanjangode, Bandipur Forest,
Ooty, Coimbtore and Trichy in about four days.
At present the club has as its equipments a few sets of cooking utensils,
stoves, and of course, life jackets (made in liT). In the years to come we
think that it wil1 have enough equiplncnt to sponsor Himalayan expeditions and
the like: And we are deeply indebted to Prof. Varghese for sanctioning enough
money fOf buying more equipment.
Fiaally my thanks go to the various members of the club, especially the
,the hostel representatives who have helped the club come up to a standard
worth reporting.
