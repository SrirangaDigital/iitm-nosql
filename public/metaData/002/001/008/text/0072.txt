Last night could have been any other night as far as anyone is concernedLeave me out. Only unusual thing that happened was that the rain which made
the plain in Spain soggy decided to drop in after it had been scared off by the sun
months ago. Otherwise everything was Okay, and it was a hard day's might too!
What with me trying to learn the back dive with my teenage friends on the beach
the whole of yesierday.
Speaking of rain and water, this 20th brithday of mine todays fills my eyes
with tears as it does my stomach with cakes. rm 20, and 'tis a pity to note that
God has had no equally good idea these 20 years after he did that wise thing,creating me, I dare say.
I'm 20, I repeat but I'd like to say I'm 19, going on 20. But after all
what's one's age-nothing but the number of times he has spun around the
blooming sun. To get to the last ball of the over-mind you it's going to be a
googly-I,m sad that my teenage years are past. But I'm glad. Hopes are
still alive. Surprised 1 Yes 1 I'm glad. all the same I'll yet be a teenagerguess when 1 Naturally-On my 113th brithday !
