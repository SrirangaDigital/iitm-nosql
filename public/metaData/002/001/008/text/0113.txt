with green velvet to serve the purpose of placing the exhibits over that. The
Judge arrives. He bears a platinum rod on his right hand. It is tbe sceptre of
Justice. He is gaudily dressed. He wears a special kind of headdress. The
court rises up as he takes his seat. The court is ordered to silence. The jury are
introduced. The judge orders that tJie trial begin.)
Pub. Prosecutor: Now melord! I'll call my vital witness. (He calls Mr.
Abyssinsa. Oath is taken over the ABYSSINTRUM the Holy Book of the
Ethiopians. Now P. P. addresses Mr. Abyssinsa.) Are you sure that
the defendent is the culprit?
Abys :

Yes, sir.

P. P.:

On what grounds do you s'port your point?

Abys:

P. P.:

The blood stain on the culprit's jacket checks with the blood of the
deceased.
You checked it with the blood from the blood bank. Didn't you?

P. M.: 1 object! my 'onour! The counsel is incriminating the evidence. Let the
witness talk on his own. (He forgets something. He stammers and says)
Ohh! 1. .. 1. .. 1 fo . rgo . t. Gardner would have told me what to say.

Judge:

Objection overruled.

P. P.:

(Looks at Abyssinsa) You may answer.

Abys:
P. P.:

The public prosecutor may proceed.

Yes, sir, 1 did. Then I found the fingerprints on the handle. They were
none but that of Mr. Alphakhan. So I concluded that he is the culprit.
(Looks at Perry Mason) Now you may cross-examine.

P. M.: (Looks at the judge) I think the evidence is incompetent and no more
vital than a bug on his coat. (He forgets again) (One of the audience: No
Gardner here, Perry!
P. M.: (Returns to Abyssinsa) 1 think you have based your points on wrong
things. Did you say that the fingerprints are that of Mr. Alphakhan ?
Abys :

Yes, sir.

P. M.: Are you sure of it?
Yes, Sir, We applied the latest electrography methods to check it with
care.
P. M.! Are you sure that those prints were made while the defendent was
engaged in the act of killing?

Abys:

Abys : I think it must have been made then.
P. M.: You being a police officer of a high calibre-(turns to the audience)
with due apologies to the Government I do not want to laugh at your
incompetency. Were you present when the parcel was delivered?
