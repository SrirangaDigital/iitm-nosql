Recently Mr. Anderson has studied the feasibility ot design of a large sea
thermal power plant-a 100,000 KW plant to be located in the Caribbean. He
has studied in detail the economic aspects of the above plant and concluded
that the initial investment cost and cost per KW -hr of the above sea thermal
Power plant will be only comparable to that of any Hydro-Electric plant of the
same capacity.
The advantages of the scheme for generating power from sea temperature
differences are that the evaporation of sea water could provide valuable chemical
by-products and also a source of distilled water. These plants are capable of
meeting increasing needs. There are no water treatment problems. Cavitation
problem does not arise since the pump impel1ers run at speeds much lower than
common hydraulic turbines and are deeply submerged. No large concrete
structures are necessary. Power supply is almost independent of the weather.
The power station has no complicated or costly auxiliaries such as are found in
modern fossil fuel or nuclear power plants. There would be no seasonal or
occasional effects such as the droughts which from time to time bedevil even well
planned hydro-electric projects. Maximum power is available in the hot seasons,
when demand is greatest.
The vision of Jules Verne, that man would harness the enormous energy
which the sun prodigiously throws down on the ocean surface, has not yet come
true. But there is little doubt that some day his dreams will come true.
