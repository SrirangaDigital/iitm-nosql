won our usual quota of trophies though there were a few upsets
both internal and external. The Annual Literary and Cultural
Week was a success and went of smoothly. A record number of
entries was received for the All India Debate, Quiz "and ~ntertain·
ment competitions.

This year we saw a new trend in the celebration of our Hostel
Days in that most of them combined in pause Much can be said
for and against this system but as results have shown, it was not
successful organisation.. wise.

This Annual Number as usual has been a race against time
and if it had not been for the concentrated efforts of Sri Ramabhadran of Sremati Printers and Sri V. John of Klein and Peyerl
it would not have been brought out in time. The Editorial Board
wishes to thank them for their unstinted help.
There are others who deserve our thanks, many who spent
their time and energies on this venture. Our sincerest thanks go
out to them.
