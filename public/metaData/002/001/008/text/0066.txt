The war Song
M. N. Krishnan
The curse fell on the human race
For killing each other is 10 very base
We cannot for shame lift our face
This will be remembered in future days.
Germany, Italy, and Japan
In thirty-nine the war began
Killing people with many a gun
As if it were onJy for fun.
First went Austria and Hungary
For the Nazis were hungry
Then they went for the lovely France
By then Mars had set afoot with a dance.
Germans beat the French and British forces
For they had a mighty resource
The German Panzers did come to the fore
To see the mighty Atlantic roll before.
Many planes in the sky did loom
Like many a lotus in a tank does bloom
They did cities roads, and men bomb
Thus breaking the nature's blessed calm.
Even during nights black as tar
Seas were crossed by men-of-war
Sinking each other without a pause
Thus creating a heavy loss,
Americans English and the French
Joined together to topple the bench
With the Soviets coming to their help
The Nazis gave a big yelp.
