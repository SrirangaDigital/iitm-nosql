Elegy written in the Oat
(With apologies to Qro4)

s.

Parameshwaran

The siren screeches in its usual way,
And student groups eonverge at Oat,
The graduates, red-robed, gather for the day
Of their departure from the lIT
Now sits the crowd on metal chairs packed tight,
And all the air a solemn stillness holds,
Save where volunteers mutter of their plight,
And ,muffled sniffing mark out those with colds,
Save where, in yonder last row seventh chair,
A third-year wit with fun and jokes holds sway,
Of criticism doing his fair share,
With hapless blundering speakers for his prey.
And in the front in seried rows they sit,
Each in his scarlet robe richly enswathed,
All wondering how, coming to think of itThey got through five (or six) long years unscathed.
The breezy call of incense-breathing mornOne charred egg, two slices of black toa st,
Followed, at seven forty, by the scorn
Of what's-his-name (punctuality his boast)No more shall rouse them from their green steel cots:
Nor, in the warm and sleepy, afternoon,
In this or that lab with its 'Don'ts' and OughtsÂ·
Shall they devise results, and leave too soon.
For them no more the dread notice shall come,
On Tuesdays, Fridays, aye, and Saturdays too;
On seeing which, eyes glazed, minds blank, heads numb,
Most men swot facts, which they no clear clue find.
