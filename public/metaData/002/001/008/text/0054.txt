Never Ride a Cycle in Madras City
By: C. S. Krishnan
Riding cycle in Madras City
Has many a peril and difficulty
It indeed is a great feat
To ride a bike in these streets.
To the right is the zooming bus
To the left is a pit full of dust
Not to speak of the sudden gust
Oh! Go ahead and try if you must.
The roads are infested with deadly pits
To break your bones into bits.
One needn't have to search one's wit
To name those who got such a hit,
Once a smart and good looking gent
Through the streets by a cycle went
Only to find it completely bent
A twisted mass less than a cent.

So I tell you my dear friends
If you don't want any more dents
Never ride a cycle in Madras City
Or it would only be a pity.
