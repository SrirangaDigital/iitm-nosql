double crossed us. What are we to do? The traitor the .. '"
"Just a minute. Whom are you talking about?" shouted the exasperated
Bahadur. Even in moments of exasperation he was grammatically correct.
"Noman! Know what he's done? He's got a lawyer to file his nomination
papers as an independent! And he's registered himself as his own election symbol.
Seems he found out that, in all our hurry and fiurry, we never did get down to
registering the Snowman as our symbol! I told you you should never have given

So that was that. The Election Symbol was duly elected by the populace
to the Lok Sabha. Noman became the Leader of the Independents, who for once
put aside their individual squabbles to rally to his support. They knew a good
thing when they saw one, especially one as large as Noman. Eventually Noman
was elected Prime Minister.
And that's why we have the first non-human being as head of government.
