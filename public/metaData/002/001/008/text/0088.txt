by advising them during their studies and by providing instruction in German aDd

a propaedeutic approach to the subjects to be studied. More than 30 assistants
are devoting their entire time to reach foreign students in groups which resemble
tutorials.
At the conclusion of our discussion about German universities IllY Indian
friend asked me whether in my opinion our system is the best. I can only reply
that I am certainly not convinced about it. When one gets to know universities
in foreign countries and", hen one discusses their problems as I have done, very
often one learns that the problems are everywhere the same or at least very
similar but that it is the means of solving them which vary so much. The methods
employed abroad are often just as good as one's own. Each country must find
solutions which suit its own traditions, the mentality of its own people and its
own particular requirements, but we should all help each otber as much as we ca n
for science' sake and for the good of our peoples,
