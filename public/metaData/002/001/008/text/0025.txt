continent. He is capable of doing full justice to table set for six, the absence
of the other five, by the way, being unnoticed by him. He has gained a fair
amount of notoriety on tbe tennis courts and the pandits of the game are sure
the game will flourish even though our worthy friend has retired from active
participation. He exhibits a keen interest for Western music and he practices
hard on a harmonica, to the detriment of my mental peace. He has, more
than once ventured into the unknown depths of vocal music, in the close confines
of his room, but the Muse in her wayward neglect of such temporal efforts has
refused to smile upon him. As this is being scribbled, I can hear snatches
from the musical: "SOM", emanating from his vocal districts, though the
credit of deciphering it as such goes to me rather than to him. Last but not
the least, there is one little thing very dear to his heart and that is Qis " brand"
as a Texan would say, that gives his lineage from Adam downwards viz.
"Andleigh" which he claims with a rare twinkle is most un-Indian like.
Well, that's all folks.

The next "Winger" will come in the next issue.
