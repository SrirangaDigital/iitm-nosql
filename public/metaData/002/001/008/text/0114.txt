Yes sir.

Abys:

P. M.:

Who else were there?

Yourself, Shankarlal, Sherlock Holmes, Hercule Poirot, Alphakhan and
the butler.

Abys :

P. M.:

Who opened the parcel?

Mr. Alphakhan. He also showed me the knife.
P. M: How did he take it ?
Abys: (Shaky) I am not quite sure.
Abys:

P. M:

Did he use a handkerchief?
Abys: No, Sir.
P. M.: Now, I'll tell you that he took it with his hand and by the handle.
The fingerprints were left at that time.
Yes, sir, it must have been so.
P. M. : My cross-exam is over.
Abys:

(looks at the prosecutor) Any more witnesses?
P. P. : No me Lord!

Judge:

Judge:

The jury will retire and decide.
(Same settings. The lights go off and return 15 sec later)

The defen,dent is not gUilty.
(Mr. Alphakhan lifts up his face and smiles.
The judge looks at him with wonder. The court is broght to order)
Judge: Before the adjournment of the court I would like to say a few words.
The defendent is nobody but the so called deceased, Mr. Hellhe Sailsea.
He is a good friend of mine. No one has made any attempts to find the
body, but has made a fuss in bringing the trial to court. Neither the
Assistant Commissioner nor the Universal Dicks. Damn this set of
wonderful brains.

Jury:

(THE BLINDS GO UP)
