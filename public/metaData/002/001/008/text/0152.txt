tions have to be carried out, it is my duty to set down in writing what the
opinions of some of our committee members as well as those of student populace
are.
Though the commitee has helped at every function held at the Institute,
(and there have been so many this year), yet, except for the Psychology Study
Circle, there has been no activity which we undertook on our own. This was not
because we were unwilling to do so, but primarily due to the fact, that with so
many committees already in existence there was no other field to pioneer in. All
external functions either came under the direct care of the entertainment committee or the literary committee leaving little for us to do.
With this in mind, one really begins to wonder at the necessity of havIng
such a committee when no definite sphere of activity can be assigned to it. It
might be wise therefore to totally scrap this committee.
