Sita left Lava and Kusha. But you left none. But I ani alone like Rami.
Rama followed his vow, namely not thinking of any other woman except Sita. I
will also, as I had been, stick to that vow. Shantbi I in my life I have nOl given
any woman a place in my heart. You occupied my empty heart and enlightened
it for short time, and suddenly deserted me. Hereafter my heart will be empty,
and dark. No other woman can step into the place you occupied. Now my heart
is a Temple without God; flower without scent; "eena without strings. I am now
an useless machine beyond repair.
But others are not able to understand this. Even your parents want to try
to enlighten my life by giving your sister Pushpa in marriage to me. No. I
elnnot allow such things to happen. Our love is eternal, and free from lust.
I am not Shah Jahan and I can not build Taj Mahal in your memory. But my
love is pure, and my heart is your monuments. You are to me not wife; you
are my Goddess and I am your devotee. I dare not garland your picture. I
.surrender the garland at your feet. Shanthi I I cannot get Shanthi in this
world without you.
