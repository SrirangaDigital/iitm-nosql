Must he calm. or they may let suspicious, The fellow was wearing khaki and as
he come near he shone his torch at Narayan aDd said, ., You are entering Madras
State and as you know no alcoholic drinks will be permitted unless you have a
special permit."
"I don't have anything".
" Are you sure sir? It is a serious offence to deny it if you have it
with you",
,. Yes. 1 am sure. Go ahead and search my car if you want, damn it".
