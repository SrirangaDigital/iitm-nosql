The Advaita Philosopby in
Bhagavat Gita
by V. Ranganathu

ALL the different religious paths with their countless schools of philosophy lead
to the same ultimate Reality, i. e. self realization or the knowledge of
the Supreme. One may wonder why 1 connect the two terms. apparently
with a glariog contralt in the meaning, but they are one and the same.
For. the highest schools of thought have evolved that knowing oneself is the
ultimate goal of man. The famous temple, Parthenon, of the Greek God
'Atbene' bears the inscription "Man know thyself." This is the quintessence of
philosophy that our forebears have evolved after troubles and turmoils in a ~riod
of intellectual vacuum. This is the greatest legacy that our ancestors have
bequeathed us. The Vedic hymn ~i(~~ (Tatwamasi) bears sufficient and
unmistakable testimony to this fact.
That to know that the individual soul is nothing but the ultimate
Reality and the tTU: knowledge is only the rea Jization of this phenomenal
merger of the individual ~"u) wjth the Supreme soul is the only attainment
of true knowledge. As the Lord says in Bhagavat Gita,

~5f~!4'~iJfwl ~;t 'Ri 1(1( I
'It is the knowledge of Matter and Spirit that I consider true

know)ed,e.~

The whole texr and substaBce of Advaita Vedanta lies on this firm
foundation. There are no two separate beinls as God and man distinctively.

The man wbo attains tbis state of mind is called ~~5f': and he,
having merged with the Supreme, does not see things to be different. He
~es the all pervading God in every act of his, and in every form that he encounters. As Lord says,
