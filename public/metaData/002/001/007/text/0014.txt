PU:lctuaHty evidently means observance and sticking to appointed time
and doing work in good time. A complaint is often heard that tbere is not much
time for work in the Institute due to too many exercises, too many examinations
and the like. Yet I find that a considerable number of students :find time to go
out sight-seeing, attend movies on Saturdays, Sundays and holidays. I find the
hostels almost empty when the Institute closes only for half a day. iIt is evident that if one programmes one's activities suitably, sufficient time can be
found to carry out one's duties to satisfaction.
A doubt arises in some students· minds as to why they should do thinas
which are not connected with their studies directly, the assumption presumably
being that manual work is too low for students. The result of such an attitude
is the creation of a community of white-collared individuals who are incapable of
doing anything constructive. You will appreciate that this state of affairs wiU
not be conducive to the advancement of OUr country.

Pride of Achievement comes by doing onc's work to pcrfcctioD llD4cr tile
supervision of elders who are qualified to guide you in your studies and other
related activities, in the Institute. It is the perseverance to attain a desired goal
that can bring joy in the work and ultimately pride in having achieved the
target.
I would like to aod that real learning leads to humility. real capability leads
one to dignity and, above all, these make one learn to respect others. I wOllld
specially empbasize that when all of you students are here in an educational
Campus it is up to you to keep up to the highest traditions of ollr time-hoRoue"
Gurukula System.

To sum UP. this will be my brief mes.lce to YOli on
"Be disciplined. calm and serene.
bend thine head in humility."
