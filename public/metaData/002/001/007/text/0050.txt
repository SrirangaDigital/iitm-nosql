us. You dared to cut her nose and disfigure her. innocent though she was. Now
I- shall cut down those hands that seized her by the hair. Defend yourself. It
Lakshmana gives a curt reply. "1 am not well versed in tongue wagging.
Let my arrows speak for me"

A fierce battle ensues between them. One by one Lakshmana destroys
Kumbhakarna's chariot and cuts down his bow. Having known his brother's
plight from swift messengers Ravana sends reinforcements. Lakshmana engages
himself with this force and begins slaughtering them wholesale.

Kumbakarna, seeing Lakshmana th us engaged goes to anotberside of the
battle field and clashes with Sugriva. During the fight, when Sugriva searches
for a handy hillock to be plucked off and thrown at his adversary I Kumbhakama
throws a deadly,spear at Sugriva. As the spear speeds towards its target,
Hanuman, noticing it, with an incredible jump reaches for the sky and catching
hold of the spear breake it into pieces.
Again Sugriva and Kumbbakarna meet, this time fighting hand to hand.
But now Sugriva is tired and grows weak. He faints during the combat. Kumbhakarna lifts Sugriva on to his shoulder and sets out for Lanka with his precious trophy. The helpless monkeys, not daring to prevent him, cry with sorrow.
They run and inform Rama of what had happened. Rama, swiftly reaches the
gates of 'Lanka and surrounded the entire town with a literal wan of arrows.
His progress thus impeded Kumbhakarna turns back and sees Rama. He
challenges Rama that if he can free Sugriva from his fold he is capable of
releasing Sita from Ravana. Rama in turn swears that he shaH never wield his bow
and arrow any more if he fails to release Sugriva. Immediately following this an
arrow released from Ramas' bow strikes Kumbhakarna and blood gushes out of
his face. Sugrive wakes up from the faint when the flowing blood wets his
face. Seeing that Kumbbakarna is engaged with Rama, witheut loosing a
moment Sugriva bites off his nose aDd ears and jumping off his shoulders refLChe3
Rama's side.
