When tbe moon is before \hem
And the night on the sky?
The people pay their respect too,
Creating a link between the two,
While the moon like a silvery ShOOD
Removes the gloom and provokes a bloe•.

TIl. The moonlight thro' the green veils, lay
Scattered on the turf like chained mails;
A solitary beam thro' the glade
Was a bright patch in the dark shade.

It steals through the hedge and skids.
A network so fine to make;
An unknown thief in the midsAs some one would mistake.
The drooping shadows of the trees
Wave in the rustling breeze,
Misleading the rays of the moon,
As they change their places soon.
When the moon is on the wave
And the glow in the grail
Pearls sprent on the grave
And the wisp on the morals.
Oil tbe shrubbery edge tbe trees and hill
Stood in silence like statues still ..... .
Their reflection in tbe gleaming fioor
Was a magnificient scene yet washed ashore.

Tbe goblet thrills the ocean to tide-

A cause which it cannot abid.;
The silvery ripple on the bosom wide.
That swings in distress from side to side.
Al1lives look for joy and mirtb.
At the gracious heaven 'om the lively earth,
The moon and stars of the heaven,
Perform. a glorious pevan.
The falling stars are shooking
Their trail behind is a fiery sheen
The imatient owls are bootinl•
.Piercin, tbro' the air screAe.
