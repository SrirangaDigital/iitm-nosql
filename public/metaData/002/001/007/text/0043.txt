Kumbhakarna - A Kambachitbram
by M. G. Srinivasan

K AMBAN has a prominent place amongst the immortal poets of the world. He is
honoured by the title" Kavichakravarti ". He was well versed in both the
classical languages of his age-Tamil and Sanskrit. He delved deep into the
great epic Ramayana in the original form by Sage Valmiki. And there arose a
desire in his heart that he should bring in the epic to the people of his land in
their tongue. The result was a wonderful creation.

monkey.
One by one his ministers and deputies rise and speak out. They all
generally agree that the two ill equipped men and the army of unarmed monkeys
cannot withstand even the slightest onslaught of the mighty Rakshasa army.
It is only over the mode of operation that they differ. Not one among them
harbours even the trace of a thought about defeat. Now comes Kumbhakarna's
turn. Though well known for the long spells of sleep he is most sober when he is
awake. He is the first among the counsellors to sharply criticise Ravana for
coveting another's wife. He also knows that the ~two weak men' are not mere
mortals and that wholesale annihilation of the Rakshasa if certain it battle ensues.
First he mocks his brother. "We will steal and confine another's wife. As the
