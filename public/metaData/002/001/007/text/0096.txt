'The Lord dwells in the heart of all beings who are mounted on the automaton of
this body. causing them by his illusive power to revolve according to their action.'
Having known this, the enlightened being views happiness and misery
aJike, ffiends and foes without any reservation or distinction.

~e has reached the tranquillity of mind wherefrom.he sees aU as the· all pervading
one. i. e. he sees little distinction between himself and the Ultimate Reality.
His mind has neither the passion for virtue nor the abhorance of the viet.
Because, he keeps his mind from both extremes and views with the same
imperturbable equanimity.

'When like a tortoise which draws in its limbs from all directions. he withdraw,
his senses from the sense-objects, his mind has become stable.'
This attitude in every individual is most desirable and implicit, not on.ty
from the stand point that he achieves a pass-port to the celestial regions on
ineffable joy and unalloyed delight, which may seem to any common man just aft
elusive charm of a ring of smoke, or again the transluscent glamour of a- soap
bubble that floats along merrily in the gentle breete that· blows, but this
attitude will help him carryon bis daily routine in the most pleasant way,
without any undue desires leading to subsequent disappointments and tendencies
which take the slightest opportunity of a man's weaknes!> of conscience to get the
better of himself and seek his ruination. May be, this. attitude may not increase
his social stature or improve his monetary position, but it certainly will teach him
to be contented with what he is and what he has, and spend his lifetime in a
useful way without making aburdJ=n of himse!lf, t'o the hpman society.
