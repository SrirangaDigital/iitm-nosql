An Evening at the
Shopping Centre
by Saktikumar
Time: 5 p.m.

A chap with a pretty serious face

Place: KapaJi Book Centre
(perfected after weeks of practice) comes

in and says:
'Say, have you got Maleev and Hartman?'
'No, sir, but I will get you onc next

Mo~day.Â·

'You have been saying this for the past month. You think you can
really get it l'
, Yessir! Definitely on Manday. t
Along Gomes another chap, virtually empties the rack and finally picks up
a book a 80py of which, in all probability, was lying on the counter and askse
'How much?'
'Rs 8.64, Sir, after discount.'
'All right, keep a. copy for me. I will collect it tomorrow.'
A more enterprising type is the guy who depalts with the book promIsIng
payment next week and will return the book after making use of it for the
periodical held that week, sayinl it's either too elementary or too advanced.
Now comes a pretty indignant bounder, shouting, 'What you! When ar,
you going to start sending the newspaper to my room?'
'Definitely from tomorrow sir.'
Apparently satisfied the customer leaves.
Now we hear a bloke asking the fellow at the counter sotto voce (apparently
explained by the presence of a lecturer)
'Have you stopped getting Parades?'
, Yessir, not available.'
