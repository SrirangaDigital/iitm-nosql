Narmada Hostel that fateful evening of the 18th December 1965. 1965 had been
ever so nice to me a11 along. Boys, now I know there are two things you can',
trust, dames and 1965.
Before I tell you something about ihe camp I had better familiarise you
with a few things in advance.
1.

GUARDS - A guard doesn't smoke while he is on duty and he does
not allow unauthorised persons inside the camp. After "Lights out"
he is the O.C.

2.

RETREAT - Usually at 2200 hrs, that is the time when you got to
that no sergeant sees the light in your room.

3.

220Q brs, don'~ a.sk me what that is. It is not on my watch. But there
is a theory which says that after 12 comes 13 and after 24 we have
O. Simple? Sorry.

4.

REVEILLE: - That' is the time when it is dark aad chilly olltlid••
There is the shrill nota ofthe bugle. You sit up in bed ud .tart
wondering if you' should be sick for the day.

S.

O.C: - No, you are wrong, it is officer commanding.

Some people have all the luck in the world. Some don't. I belong to the
signals coy. You ask any si,nals guy what he did during the camp. The first
thing he is likely to tell yo u about is that on the 26th of December he went out
for a route march starting at 2300 hrs. walked 15 miles and reached back Amp
at 03.30 hrs on the 27th, carrying shovels, picks and .303 rifles. That, ladies and
gentlemen, was one of the 14 days we spent in camp.
Ever seen pictures? I mean pictures like Surrender Hell. Longest Day etc.?
Saw those soldiers crawling up the beach. Take it from me. buddy, theyare
doing it all wrong. We signal guys ought to know it. We attacked the water tank
next to the Ladies club 10 many times.

By the way, you might be interested in two important points you would do
well to remember. Whatever the operation. Attack. Advance to contact.
DEFENCE OR WITHDRAWAL. (ordinary)
Do not obstruct the path of the enemy bullet.
Do not be in the line of vision of your Officer.
