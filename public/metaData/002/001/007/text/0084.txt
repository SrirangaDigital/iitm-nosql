was therefore ultra vires of Art .. 20 (3). Taking of the thumb impression while
under arrest for comparison is also a prohibition under this· clause.
This prohibition against 'self-incrimination has, to a substantial extent,
been recognised in the criminal administration of justice in this country by
incorporation into various Statutes like the Criminal Procedure Code, the Indian
Evidence Act and the Indian Oaths Act. As put by an eminent jurist, "So
1ong as the presumption of innocence remains a· part of our legal system,
evidence against an accused shou]d come from sources other than the accused
himself".
Thus we ind under our Constiution that even a person accused of a crime
enjoys three important fundamental rights-the right to demand that he could
not be proceeded against ex post facto laws, the, right to plead double
jeopardy when he is prosecuted and punished for the same offence twice over
and the right to refuse to be a witness against himself. These fundamental
guarantees, along with others incorporated under Part III of our Constitution
are advisedly put beyond the contro] of the State and they protect our £ights
and liberties against the States' possible encroachment and arbitrary invasions.
The fundamental rights are above the vicissitudes of political controversy and
are beyond the reach of the road-roller majorities and they are, as it were,
restrictions or limitations on the three processes of government-executive,
legislative and judicial. As observed by Madison, who played a prominent role
in the framing of the First Amendment of the United States Constitution, the
fundamental rights are secured "not by laws paramount to prerogative but ~y
Constitutions paramount to laws".
