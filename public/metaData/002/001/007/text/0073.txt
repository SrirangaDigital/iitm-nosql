The Ways of I. I. T.
Situated near the sanctuary of deer,
This lIT is indeed very queer.
It has a Campus huge and vast,
Where the builldings are coming up very fast.
Hostels here are shaped geometrically.
Within which students mug. mechanically.
Known for its length is the HS Block,
Where majority of students go and fiock.
Workshop is students' headache in 1st year.
After which, they are tired, lost all cheer.
Periodicals are lIT students' main fear,
And shiver when its name they hear.
Periodicals are students' Achilles' heel,
Name of which make students' reel.
Cs and Ds are the talk of the day,
Since periodicals a.re graded this way.
Periodicals here arc indeed very unique,
Where students employ new copying techniques.
Saturday afternoons students contempJate sadly,
Why in periodicals they fared So badly.
The brain is strained right through the day,
But during evening games and brawn has its say.
Have you ever seen IIT by night,
All students cramming will be a wonderful sight.
There is some entertainment on Sunday night,
When students' spirit is carefree and light.
