The Vanavam Primary School
by Fatber Mvpby i. J.

The name was given to it by the Director. It is, I understand, a name that combines 'knowledge' with 'goddess of the
forest' . The forest no doubt is swift disappearing, giving place to
blocks of houses advertised by a wealth of sanitary pipes. This
little school, which held its Olympics early in March by the
kindness of the authorities, is already bursting at the seams. It has
already reached its maximum strength of 350 with two sections in
each of its five classes. It is quite safely co-educational with the
girls not yet established as the weaker sex. The statT consists of
seventeen members not counting peons and ayahs. Hindi is taught
daily in all the classes and Tamil in most. The nursery children
have a good sleep in the afternoon, which enables them to be a
sweet and fresh nuisance at home. Very recently the ladies and
gentlemen of the fifth standard were taken for a picnic to Pulicat
where the ride in a boat and the splashing in the sea was perfect
heaven, all the more so that they were allowed under excessive
supervision to wade up to the knees, though it was not always clear
where the knees end and the head begins .
