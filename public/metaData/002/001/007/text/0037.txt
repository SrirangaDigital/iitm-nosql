Til. Wilt tile ltiris did tllr••,;
As ahead of tIlem was til. bluiBI balt
Babbling thro' tke air came the even' song
Tin they announced the night fall.
As the evening lass stood before the mirror,
The waves transverse heavily leapt,
She behold her cheeks rose in colour
And slowly they became scarlet.
1'&e sea bathed in Crimson
And the forthing waves in contrast
The beauty was something Winsorue,
No beUer could anything be cast.
Every nascent streak of surf
Was my tempting host
Treating me on the sandy turf,
As to many along the coast.

My lonely shadow adorned the scene
I steed drinking in the air serene;
Some branching shell inside tbe foan
I felt. 'The natures gift'-I took it home.
