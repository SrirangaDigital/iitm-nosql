the field. Pataudi's forte is his uncanny ability to lift the ball over heads of
fieldsmen-the suresl invitation to suicide as the text books would say. Yet it
was an art practised by the old maestros. Wolleyor Victor Trumper practised
the art assiduously and were living legends in their time for the pleasure they
gave to the spectator. The fetish that the ball must be kept to the ground at
all costs is a morbid modem concept, which has made the game arid. Pataudi
is never afraid to jump out to the bowler and loft the ball, in his own inimitable,
lovely way, over the untenanted parts of the field, though he and every spectator
present know that the slightest mistake would be fatal. But time and again,
Mansur does it, scores rapidly and makes the game more fascinating for it. As
has, succinctly, been summed up .. He is not the one to suffer his innings. He
must play it on his own terms or not at all; he is perfectly willing to surrender
it. He will not wait for the runs to come to him, for his conception of the art
of batsmanship is more vigorous, less hindered by modern concepts. He has
no place in a war of attrition. When the Nawab is at the wicket, one may
easily imagine the field as Ashby-de-la-Zouche, where the knights joust.' It may
be a brief moment, but it must be a glorious one.
Indian cricket docs, indeed, owe much to the royal Tiger from Pataudi.
