As the year fades away, we can look back with a certain
amount of pleasure and a sense of achievement.
The first phase of the Institute was successfully completed.
Most of the proposed laboratories were ready for use, thanks to the
efforts of the German and Indian staff. The development of the
second phase has started off on the right foot. The total foreign
aid outlay under the first agreement was 1.8 crores. Collaboration
with a consortium of German Universities is necessary at this stage.
The Institute has gone ahead with this and already we have had
representatives of the Berlin Technical University and the Brunswich Technical University here.
The main workshop buildings are a]ready comp]ete. Work
has commenced on the multi-storeyed Administrative Block and on
the Central Library. The Campus has also achieved near selfsufficiency with staff houses, a shopping centre. a Primary and a
Higher Secondary School. An Olympic size swimming pool and a
boat club will give additional recreative facilities .

Of the students, the Institute can well be proud. They have
always covered themselves with glory in the past. On the Sports
field tbe performance was consistent though not outstanding, save
for our tennis and rowing teams. This year we entered more
tournaments than ever before.
