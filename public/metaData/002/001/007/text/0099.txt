you wont be getting a promotion for a long time".
It was all because of the cyctt.-. thought Mool Chand bitterly. He had
not bought any new clothes for a long time because he was saving up for it.
And if he had lost it, he would be coming to office comfortably on time every
day, instead of walking that long distance.
The more he thought of it, the more bitter he became. Why should he
suffer like this 1 What wrong had he done to be punished by the Gods in such
a manner? It was unfair. Slowly his bitterness and sorrow turned to anger.
By God, he would set things right! But how 1 How could he get the cycle
back? Only that could set everything right. Suddenly he got an idea. If
someone could steal his cycle why could he not steal someone else's 1 It was so
easy. Of course. not from the office but from somewhere else. He became
intoxicated with the idea; and ignored the voice of conscience which warned him
of the possible consequences. He was crazed with one thought now-he must
get a cycle by hook or by crook-today.
His thoughts were absolutely unChanged as be strode out of the office in
the evening. In fact he was determined to steal a cycle, and to hell with the
consequences. He was confident that if others could get away with his cycle he
could get away with someone elses. As he walked home he kept a sharp lookout'
for any unlocked cycles. But he had ne luck. All the cycle were locked. As
he neared home he became more desperate. More over it was getting dark. As
he neared home he took a round about route, one which would take him a few
extra furlongs, but one which offered greater opportunities for stealing a cycle.
He looked everywhere around him, no luck, there was no unlocked cycle to be
seen. Terribly disappointed he turned homewards. On the way he passed the
little coffee house that he knew so well. Through the open door he could see
his friends inside laughing and merrymaking. He should have been there
with them, enJoymg life. instead of looking for a cycle to steal.
It was then that he saw it. Ao unlocked cycle leaning against the
wall! He went closer aod checked. Yes it was unlocked I Be could quietly
take it away. A few quick glances around told him that nobody was watching.
As quietly a's possible he removed the cycle from the wall; mourlted it, and
rode away.
Only when he was on his way, did he realise what he had done. He
was a thief. If he was caught he would
be seot to prison:
his family would be disgraced and all sorts of things could happen.
