subject at the graduate level would be very harmful to a group of iIltelligenl
students.
It is very desirable to note at thi. juncture, that if graduate studies are to
be exciting for the students and teachers, the teachcr should have the courage to
learn from the students, whcnever the situation demands. Everyone, whether hc be
a student or teacher, should be Cl:onfident of what he knows and should avoid at
all costs to be an introvert trying to worry about what he does not know. Only the
supreme authority of a logical argument need be respected.

Summary
An attempt is made to lay down certain ideal conditions and objectives for
teaching in general. Certain teaching methods are recommended to fulfil specific
objectives for graduate and under graduate studies against a given background of
pre-requisites.

Finally in concluding this essay, it is but necessary to mention the status
of examination in the above scheme. It is only permitted as a tool for the teachcr
to assess how much of what he has taught is assimilated by the student. Any
other aspect of a given examination system falls outside the scope of this
essay.
