Hydropbobic Acid

acid is a rare eompound found in small quantities
in steak. It was originally detected in a sample of toothpaste
indicating its presence by dissolving the rea~ teeth forming a six-molar solution
of calcium sex identate.
HYDROPHOBIC

Hydrophobic acid dissociates readily into hydrogn ions and phobate ions
POBO a • Chelation of the ion with acrolein forms acrophobia, a compound
which tends to jump off from high places. Reaction of the phobate ion with the
philate ion PHlLaO.-causes violent rcaction. Stand back and duck state that
the report of tbis reaction caused a big boom in tbeir business followed by a
rapid expansion.
OYer and Dover report the isolation of 0.00 gram of hydrophobic acid by
extraction of 50,001 pancares with maple syrup. This was later, however,
identified as Krypton uranyl denteride Kr U D. Dover who devoted' 30 years of
his scientific life to this extraction still stoutly maintains that he obtained
hydrophobic acid. " Impositive, "he shouted. "Keep·,those electron.c; away
from me."
Hydrophobic acid has only one application to physical chemistry. a plot
of revolution against the government giving a solution which remains hanging.

2. A chemistry Lecturer started his class with the following equation.

The point he drove home was the paradox often created by the use of common
nomenclature to express chemical reactions. Translated, the above equation
reads.
Quicklime +silver-..Lime + Quicksilver.
