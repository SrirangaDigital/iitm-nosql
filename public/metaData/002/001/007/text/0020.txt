My most unforgettable
Character
by G. Sampatla

"THE Character of Cordelia" says

Dr Bradley .. is not a masterpiece of
invention or subtlety like that of Cleopatra: yet in its own way it is a
G(eation as wonderful". Cordelia appears in only four of the twenty-six
scenes in KiDg Lear. She slleaks -it is hard to believe it-scarcely more than a
hUDdred lines and yet no character in Shakespeare is more absolutely
individual or most ineffaceably stamped on the memory of his readers-like an
angelic vision of moral loneliness. She haunts our ima@ination from beginning
to end. Everything in her seems to lie beyond our view and affects us in a
manner which we feel rather than perceive.
If one tries to sum up her character in one word, the word "restraint"
seems most appropriate. Her conduct in the opening scene reveals her self
controlling capacity. When Lear asks her.

"What can you say to draw a third more .0puJent than your sisters'"
She replies.
"Nothing my lord."
She cannot heave her heart into her mouth because she is Cordelia. Her
sell controlling capacity is even more clear in ber "asides". She says to herself
thus. "What shall Cordelia do. Love and be silent". This fine character of
CordeJia is revealed in the conversation between Kent and a gentleman towards
the close of the play.
Gentleman :........ ...It seemed she was a queen over her passion, who
most rebel like sought to be king over her.
Kent: 0, then it moved her.
Gentleman: Not to a rage; patience and sorrow strove
Who should express her goodliest. You have seen
Sunshine and rain at once; her smiles and tears
Were like a better day; those happy smilets
That play'd on her ripe lip seem'd not to know
What guests were in her eyes; which parted thence
