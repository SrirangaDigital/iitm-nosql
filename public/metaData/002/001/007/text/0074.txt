If you happen to see an lIT lad,
You may wonder why he is dressed so bad.
This is due to cAmericanisation~ in fiT vogue,
Whick makes him look more like a rogue.
Mess bills' in lIT have a wonderful property.
Of always increasing and tending to infinity.
Buses here break the barrier of sound,
And are sure to beat "Moss" by a round.
Seniors thought ragging was indispensable and dear,
But it has died for "disciplinary action" fear.

If Higgins heard IlTians in' English converse,
He will with English seek divorce.

Those "Va's" and "Vars" are harsh to hear.
That it will surely move Higgins to tears.
In NCC parade after a bard day,
Students march in their own queer way.

Nee is Madras lIT's greatest fake,
Students attend only for attendance sake.
Common sense doesn't appeal to IlTian brains,
They know only to calculate stresses and strains.
Every IITian can think he is clever and great,
But has flopped due to fiuctations of fate.
Students here are measured in "grades."
That will decide their future "trades."
After coming into ITT many students wonder,
Whether they have made more serious a blunder.
If you can survive in IlT five long years,
You Ian face odds in life without any fears.
