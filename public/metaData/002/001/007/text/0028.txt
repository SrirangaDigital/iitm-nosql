at present is more at a challenging nature, rather than an easy passaac. there
is so much to learn and so little time that many hours of concentrated and
efficient study arc required. It is not only difficult, but it is also so
exacting. "A~most right" or "correct except for the decimal point" is not
acceptable.
Tbe engineer is engaged in creative, productive and constructive work,
whereas the doctori' patients are usually ill and the lawyers' clients are in
trouble, the engineer is primarily concerned with healthy gro\\ing and productive activities. Then why can't better performance be not exhibited by an
engineer?
Every successful engineer would know the joy of creation, creation of a
new concept, device, process, or procedure out of his own knowledge. thought
and experience.
Succesll in engineering usually requires interest, aptitude and drive;
however a deficiency in one eharacteristic can be compensated for by extra
strength in the other two.
lf students of engineering guide them-selves along these times and gain
technical knowledge, engineering is a wonderful field full of a host of opportunities for exciting satisfying work and a life time career .
