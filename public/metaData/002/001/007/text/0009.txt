tn the literary field, lIT reigned supremo. Dunng the literary
and cultural week lIT made a c lean sweep in all the events and as
the Director remarked, "IlT walks in and walks out with the
trophy."
In the Academic side, the year saw a number of startlmg
changes, as far as the student was concerned. The examirlation
system was changed a couple of times and the staff and students
have as yet to settle down to the new system.

Our first Registrar, Sri R. Natarajan lAS, went back to the
State Cadre to take up his new assignment as Admmistrator of the
Sethusamudram Project. He was associated with the Institute
from its inception. His popularity can be gaged from the fact
that he is almost triumphantly carried on the shoulders of the
students (who have nothing to gain from him from the point of view
of periodicals and leave) when he comes to the Institute. Sri C. V.
Sethunathan succeeded Sri NataraJan. Sri Sethunathan has had
considerable experience in the educational field .

This Annual Number has been a fight against time. At one
stage, it was thought that there would be no Annual Number
owing to lack of time. However, because of the Herculean efforts
of Sri V. John of Klein & Peyed, and Sri Ramabhadran of Sremati
Printers, it was possible to bring out the magazine in the space of
little over a week. The Editorial Board wishes to thank them for
their co-operation and unstinted help. There are others who deserve
our thanks; others who have spent much of their energies on this
venture. It is not possible to mention any of them by name.
because of lack of space.
The response from the members of the Institute has been
overwhelming. Despite the short notice, this magazine is bigger
than the previous issues. For this all the contrIbutors deserve a
pat on the back.
