earthly problem, at any rate while they are OIl the roads, is ampiy inuttfated tJy
speed with which our taxi and busdrivers the propel their vehicles.

If we extend a little more, we see that the problem of obligations can
be formulated quite easily whatever be the locale. It is just like lookin. at
a lake from different altitudes, its position never varying, only its aspect changing
relatively to the position from which you look at it. As long as our approach
to a group remains individualistic, no solutiOll to the problem seems possible.
If we gear up our faculties to thinking about others also, we ,hall perhaps be
ODe step nearer to the solution.

Our literary Week
Five evenings-crowded with delight,
Evenings free of the Periodical blight,
Thunderous clapping and vociferous cheersOften marred by 'boos' and jeerâ€¢.
Packed in a room which for a sardine is small.
The audience grew restive and began to baw).
As the air grew warm and rather stale,
The interest of the audience grew wan aad pale.
When our teams was on, the audience was quiet,
But when the others came on, it became a riot.
Oh staunch l. I. TiaDI, it just isnt cricket,
To keep the bouqets sand dish out the briquets.
There is a saying wise and true,
That you can't eat your cake and keep it too,
But that's just what you do the I. I. Tian way,
When you win the prize but live it. awa.y.
But over, alas, are those evenings bript,
The jail door clangs, shut out the light,
With hoarse tbroats and spirits low,
To periodicals' dectates we apin bow.

-R. K. Piik....
