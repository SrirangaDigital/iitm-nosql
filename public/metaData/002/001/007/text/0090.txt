'The Lord dwells in the heart of all beinls who are mounted OD the automaton of
this body, causing them by his illusive power to revolve according to their action.'
Having known this, the enlightened being views happiness and misery

He has reached the tranquillity of mind wherefroml1e sees all as the all pervadiilg
one. i. e. he sees little distinction between himself and the Ultimate Reality.

better of himself and seek his ruination. May be, this attitude may not increase
his social stature or improve his monetary position, but it certainly will teach h~
to be contented with what he is and what he has, and spend his lifetime in a
useful way without making a burden of himself to the· hl1man sOciety.
