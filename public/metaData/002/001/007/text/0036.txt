The dark clouds hid the silvery chaste.
Long before they flew in haste;
While each beam like a search light,
Emerged out and the moon bright.
V. Oh moon! what does thee aim?
What does thee wish or freak?
Have you anything to claim.
From these objects plain,
That something in them you seak?
We who are in futile strife
Entangled in the nets of life
Dream of them but in rain
Think of things gone and slain
The worm glowing on the mellifeeoDs blossom
Is no dout a pleasant sight;
But thine splendour in spring or autumnA heavenly angel among the, "Candle Li,hts".

Alons the sandy beach ......
At the sky line I perceived
When I neared the seashore
A livid tint unachieved
So far-which grew more and more.
The waves roared in their swelling joy
I heard them sing the chorus,
On the slope like molten alloy
They perculated thro' the sand porons
The waves came racing
And approached the sJoping target
But many fo]Jowed, chasing
Rolling together and fidget.
Across flew the droplets saline:
The waves drew even and I towards then
Their taste and aroma better than awine,
And th' rhyme Il gargling fathom.
