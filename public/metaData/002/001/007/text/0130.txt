out any hope of personal gain. Many of us know othe story of Abu Ben Adhem.
He loved and therefore served his fellowmen. He was rewarded with the distinction of being the first and foremost among those whom love of God had blessed.
InoMahabharatha one of the focal characters is Yudhishtira who was famous for
his justice and mercy. When he went to heaven, a dog also accompanied him.
But it was not allowed to entor heaven. Yudhishtira said that unless the dog was
admitted, he would not enter heaven. It was love that made him say that.
Buddha had said that he will not attain Nirvana till even a single soul remained to
be saved. It was love that made him say that. Lord Krishna said that, for
protecting good people, for destroying evil. and for establishing righteousness on
earth, he was born again and again in this World. It was love that made him say
that. It was love that made Jesus Christ pray for his enemies and murderers.
"Holy Father. forgive them. They know not what they do". Christ's life was
love in action. By his love he revealed the perfect character of God. "GOD IS
LOVE" The essence of Christ's teaching is "Love thy neighbour as thyself.
Love your enemies. Bless them that curse you. Do goodlto them that hate you.
Pray for those that despise you and persecute you". Jesus conquered the World,
only because of his aU-embracing love. In our own life time we have seen how
Mahatma Gandhi lived a pure and perfect life like Jesus. He also has conquered
the world through love. Love is undoubtedly the greatest thing in the World.
There is no higher force in the Universe than Love. For "GOD IS LOVE".
The poet Samuel Taylor Coleridge ends his poem "The rhyme of the
Ancient Mariner" with this verse.
"He prayeth well; who loveth well
All things both great and small
He prayeth best who loveth best
Both man and bird and beast'"
