Music in Technology Land
by T. Varadarajan

WHAT bas Technology to do witb music? Why-a lot I, though

music is not in
the curriculum for the B. Tech. course, as far as the student is concerned;
and though they don't have a sabha in the campus, as far as the staff are
concerned-the former need not study music and the latter need not bother to

minutes behind schedule. When I entered the hall, Musiri Subramaniya Iyer was
speaking, giving his blessings to the Sabha. I have heard him speak a number
of occasions and he is one of the wittiest speakers I have heard. I could smell
the sandal paste and rose petals offered at the entrance. The formal opening speech
had earlier been made by Mr T. Viswanatha Iyer of Mylapore and the
Kathyayini Sangeetha Sabha was born in the presence of Lord Rama and his
