bride to that of the bridegroom in one form or the other. Under the prevaient
condition of the Indian societies, engineering graduates, I think, have the highest
cash-value in the matrimonial market. In general, the va111e of the dowry a
girl fetches is inversely proportional to her beauty. In other words, very
beautiful girls may not be expected to fetch any dowry at all, whereas uncouth
girls have to pay a heavy penalty in the form of dowry (for their ugliness?)
After becoming a Bachelor of Technology, I decided to put an end to
my bachelorhood. I have had the pleasant experience of having interviews with
two different girls at two different places. The first girl was moderately beautiful,
moderately educated and the dowry offered was also moderate. The alliance
was cancel1ed because the girl has been found to be sliahtly older than myself?
The second girl was more beautiful and better educated than the first;
but the dowry offered was not very handsome. The alliance was cancellell
because the girl has a dyspeptic personality!
After being fed up with such procedure of bride-selection, I lave an
advertisement in a popular newspaper which runs as follows:
U A fresh engineering graduate with very broad views seeks an educated
bride preferably below 20. She should be the oniy daughter of a very rich m.an.
Beauty of the girl and the properties of her father are the main conciderations."
