(3) People did not go out during the Thani Avarthanam thinkinl that
it is the interval'.
(5) One of the artistes taking leave of the audience in the middle of
the performance.
(5) No pan-shop (with cool· drinks) was ovailable outside.
Prof. Krishnan gave a good performance as usual. It looked at one
stage like the National Programme of the AU-India Radio-I mean the applause
following each of the pieces. The accompanying artistes drew appreciation
specially during entharo mahanubhavulu and later during thani avarthanam.
sankarabharanam was main raga of the evening. The raga-malika that followed
seemed to be a bit long, but on the whole it was a wonderful performance by
Prof. Krishnan.
In spite of the restriction on the 'below-12 year-olds' I saw a few boys
going here and there (llaler came to know that they were helper eogaged in the
arrangment, etc. and not invitees). At one stage, looking at Vinayakaramane
(Ghatam) I wo~dered if he was over 12 years. Somebody said that age limit
doesn't apply to artistes. Anyway members may be well-advised to keep one
attested copy (by a Magistrate or a Gazetted Officer) of their proof age in their
pockets for inspection•

. Sometime later, an Asst. Professor getting in the row before me asked
me to 'take care of his seat' as he was going out for the next half-an-hour.
When asked for details he revealed 'My wife is standing outside with the baby;
the agreement is that I shaJI be inside for half-an-hour and then go out to take
over the baby so that the next half·an-hour can be hers, etc.'
Prof. Krishnamurthi while proposing the vote of thanks described the
hall as 'very beautiful.' AU agreed with the compliment paid to the ball except
for the 'echo' aspect of it. Music being so closely connected with Technology as
has been proved earlier, the organisers may well seek the help of the technologists and engineers to see if Mr Echo can be branded 'below 12 years' so that
he is not allowed inside the hall.
