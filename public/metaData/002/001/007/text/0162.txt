work on week days. Unfortunately due to unavoidable reasons, work on the
swimming pool had to be stopped. It is hoped that the pool would be ready au,
year.
The committee has Dr Varghese as the staff advisor and the
committee is indebted to him for his ready help at all times. The nature of the
various activities of the committee are such that it is not apparent they have gone
a long way in contributing to the success of the very lIlany activities of the
Institute.
