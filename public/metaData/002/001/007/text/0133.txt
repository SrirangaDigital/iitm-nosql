this was the niost important chapter of his education ... to stand up and oppose
public opinion, to stand fast and fight for his covictions. Tomorrow he would
no longer be shy and reserved, because he had to-day learnt the lesson.
Half way down the alley he released the fighting fuming cat. By the
light of the comer lamp I saw it vanish into the main street crowd. Mukand
came in quietly, not snivelling as was usual after he got hurt, but with an odd
kind confidence oCcalm in his face. He went to sleep without having his dinner,
groaning just a little due to his bruised condition.

It was morning, the rosy summer dawn. I got up rather early. Mukand
lay tossing and turning in his sleep. By his pillow sat the mangy little creature,
the cat he had rescued. She licked his face to heal the scratches she had made
herself. My mother got up to shoo the cat away, but she didn't understand. 1
stopped my mother from doing so. We both sat down and watched. The
hero rested, his admirer nursed.
