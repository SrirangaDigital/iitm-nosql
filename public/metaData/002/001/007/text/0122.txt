THE mail train

from Kumbakonam screeched its way through the dark night,
pulling behind it seven odd carriages. All the compartments were relatively
quiet except for one particular compartment where in the harsh grating voice of
one individual only could be heard.

The compartment in question which interests us was crowded. To say it

engrossed in his extempore (for it was in Tamil that our hero was talking and
every new and then earned a smile for his efforts. He was telling to his neighbour,
the ricemerchant from NeJlore, "You see, sir, I know the tricks employed by the
criminals. I am a detective working on my own. Not an amateur, mind you.
