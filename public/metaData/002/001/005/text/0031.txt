to achieve a balance of power and influence between the two great
powers. Before 1960, Khrushchov was certainly more in the lime light
than the American President (Eisenhower). His acts and speeches were
given more importance and coverage even in the U. S. press. But
Kennedy managed to attract as much attention as Khrushchov. This he
did not by ignoring or condemning the Soviet leader, but by understanding him.
A few years ago, at a diplomatic party in Moscow, PremierÂ·

any foolish military manoeuvre by McCarthyists in the Pentagon.
The net effect of all this Was that for once, the two greatest powers
of the world moved towards one and the same goal-' peaceful
co-existence. The extremists were, for the first time, being condemned
by both sides. China quarrelled with Russia. America refused to
support colonialism. And both not only called for. but took steps in
