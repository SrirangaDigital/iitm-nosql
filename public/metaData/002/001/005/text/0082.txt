FIFTH ANNUAL NUMBER

They were on errand of the Department of utilization of National
Resources to ex.plore and exploit the copper ore in that area, and
what they found was the promising deposits of malachite.
After the usual delay, they started prospecting for the ore
with zealous hope. But soon, to their great surprise, the borers
had touched upon a very hollow space, during the process of mining. On further digging and investigation, the geologist concluded
that they had been digging a mound under which lay a huge
cave which on further exploration may yield some invaluable
treasures of ancient History.

The National Bureau of Archaelogical Investigation had sent an
expert archaelogist and an anthropologist to the site where the exploration of malachite was going on. The mining of the ore had been
temporarily stopped~ and the spot had the appearance of the excavation
of Ur in Sumaria.

After an endless endeavour and research, they prepared long report
of 285 pages. The report was published in the Joufl).al of the National
Bureau of Archaelogical Investigation, which, later on, had to be
summarized and" added to the previous facts (obtained in- a similar
fashion) regarding the culture and civilization of the pre-historic Man.
The gist of the report is prest'nted below: "The successful excavation near the oldest city enlightens the historian on the following facts. The cave-man, who had lived here probably ten thousand years ago had the most complex. civilization history
has ever known".
The sketches and inscriptions on the walls of the cave show that
he had a great artistic taste unsurpassed by any other of the same species
existing at that time. Peculiarly enough, the inscriptions consisted
of ideographs - both hieroglyphics and cuneiform script.
The Chief item of his food was the fish a fact confirmed by the
presence of considerable number of heaps of skeletal remains of fish
inside eave.
