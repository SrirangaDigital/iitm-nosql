FIFTH ANNUAL NUMBER

Inter - Collegiate events which were conducted with a fair measure of
success in spite of other activities overlapping in this period. There
were only two outstation teams - one was from our sister Institute at
Kharagpur and the other one was the Eng. College team from Sri Venkateswara University. Q.M.C. of Madras literally ran away with the
trophy while both Individual prizes were successfully won QY
Mr. Siddhartha and Mr. Vaswani. Chandran al1d Reddy of Eng.
College were successful in the Quiz with a large majority of points. The
"Group Discussion" trophy was once again retained by the home team,
which was undoubtedly the best on tha4 day. The German Recitation
Trophy went out for the first time when Mr. Venkateswaran of
A. C. Tech. performed well. The last day's programme concluded
with an Inter-Collegiate Entertainment Competition, which was won by
the ever gay ladies of Q.M.C.
It might be mentioned here that hut for the interest taken in the
literary activities by the committee members Mr. Vikrama Rao and
Mr. Vaswani, and Dr. Venkateswarlu in particular, the various items
conducted by the Institute would not have been half as successful as
they were.

It is hoped that the future will hold bright promises of glorious
success in the various literary activities.
