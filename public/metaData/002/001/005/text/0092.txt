He heard clairvoyance one night and the Lord instructed him to find
out one, Rama by name, greatest of his devotees, who will be in the
precints of the Srirangam Temple with a scar on"his right forehead and
long thick eye-brows. Sri Chaitanya was coming in a procession along
the four streets of the town, his attention being fixed on finding such a
person. On enquiry, he came to know that such a person was there in
the temple premises but he was a bit mad. Sri Chaitanya went in search
of him and having found him, prostrated and told him that he
would like to hear his learned exposition of Bhagavad Gita from
his mouth. Soon a big .crowd gathered around Raman;
the Ulunatic", waiting for him to respond to their request.
The crowd waited for long but Raman would'nt speak. After
sometime he told that his father had presented him a book of
"Bhagavad Geetha" and told him that it is the quintessence of Hindu
Dharma. He added, "Daily I would open the book and see the
figure of Lord Krishna riping Arjuna's chariot and at the very sight of
that picture, tears used to roll down from my eyes;. the book will disappear from my eye sight; I will see two armies, one of Pandavas and
another of Kauravas on the KurukshetraÂ· field and the Lord doing
Geethopadesa to Arjuna." Nothing elso I know of Bhagavad Geetha."
On hearing this, Sri. Chaitanya repeatedly prostrated before him and
came away, praising his unsullied sublime devotion.
