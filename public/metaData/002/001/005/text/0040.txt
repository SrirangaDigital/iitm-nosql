A Poem
(S. R. Sivaramakrishnan & R. Subramanian)

Peace my heart! Nor ev'r yet try to solve
The problem - How and what the guiding hand
Doth work - that man should yearn for, seek a thing.
But ever and anon thwarted should it be.
Vexed, forlorn, when grows to hate the same
As worthless, 10, on him then faUs it pat.
Soapy moved uneasy on his bench.
Was that Jack Fros'ts card! Aye, on his lap
That fell, the dead leaf! He must now resolve
Into a committee of Ways and Means,
And provide against the rigour of Jack.
"Three months on the island" Blackwell's guest,
Was all he craved. For years it had been
His winter quarters. For he thought the law
Was more benign than philanthropy. Sure
His proud spirit detested, scorned the gifts
of Charity. For it was encumbered.
In humiliation you will have to pay.
Hence he chose to be the guest of law.
Soapy left his bench and strolled away
Up Broadway. He would dine luxuriously
At some expensive restaurant, declare
Insolvent and be handed o'er to a cop.
He thought of what to eat; and in he stepped.
The waiter-chief observed his trousers frayed,
And shoes decadent. Ready hands him turned
About, in silent haste conveyed to the walk.
Loafing off, he came to a corner, a shop
In sixth avenue. He caught the chance.
A cobble stone he crashing sent across
On to the display glass front. People came
Running, and a cop around the comer.
