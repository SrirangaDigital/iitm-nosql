INDIAN INSTITUTE OF TECHNOLOGY, MADRAS

witness - a villager - whose companion was involved in a rail road accident, was asked to give an account in his own words. And he
came out with :
"Well, X and I was walking down the track and I heard a whistle and I got off the track and the train went by and got . back on the
track and pretty soon seen X's hat and I walked and seen one of X's
leg and then seen X's arm and then another leg and then over one
side X's head and I say' upon my soul, something must have happened
to X'!
When an account of such accidents appears in newspapers they
are sometimes more funny than serious. One _{uch account says:
'Mr. X Y Z drove accidentally over a stone wall and his car crashed. He would have been 39 yrs old next Sept.' Call it an accident
of birthday 1
1 read in an insurance pamphlet, that a large' percentage of accidents happen in the 'Kitchen' and I say it is right too. But I pity
the husbands who have to eat them and pretend they like them. Thank
God; I am a bachelor!

In Industry when accidents happen, they are followed by a long
inquiry and report. I am sure writing a report is a hell of a job. One
foreman was puzzling over the papers which had to be filled out
explaining details of the accident in which one of his workmen lost his
life by falling from a high scaffold. At last he managed to complete
the task except one line that stumped him. Finally licking his pencil
he applied himself firmly to the section headed' 'Remarks' and
wrote 'He did not make one!'
So is there not a pleasant side to an accident '1 In fact it is much
more than this. So I say,
"Accident don't just happen but often create lot of fun !"
