GERHARD FISCHER

As one associated with the founding and the phased development of liT, I have great pleasure in sending a message to the
annual edition of the institution magazine.
The crest of one of the prominent Universities in South India
contains the noble thought - expressed as only Sanskrit can:
" there is nothing comparable to or excelling knowledge". As
a rider or corollary to this is another declaration made repeatedly by great men of this land, who were adding their voices
to kindred souls in other parts of the world before them, that
knowledge is not the exclusive birthright and property of any
individua1, a society or a nation but the common inheritance of
all mankind.
