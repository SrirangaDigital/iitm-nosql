Sparks From The Accounts Anvil.
G. T. Sundarrajan
"Ever let the Fancy roam
Pleasure never is at home
But when Accounts - Audit combine
Pleasure is for ever mine."

Strange but 'True
1. Construction of a building completed in all respects within
the original estimate.
2. Annual account of a Provident Fund of a subscriber, issued
by the Account General completely correct, without any missing
credit.
3. An Accountant passing a bill without even once returning it.
4. An Auditor who is happy to issue a 'Nil' Audit Report on the
accounts of a Project.

S. The Accounts Section of a big organisation of Government
given adeqwlte and efficient staff and
accommodated in a
convenient place side by side with the Administration Section.
6. A gazetted Officer not getting excited over a dis-allowance by
the Treasury of Rs. 0.31 nP. from his medical reimbursement claim
for Rs. 984.87 nP, the deduction being due to an error in totalling by
the claimant.

Too Strange to be true
1. It is reported that with a view to avoid delay in payment of
medical claims, an office has installed an electronic device by which the
claim presented at the Accounts Section is checked immediately and passed on to the Cash Section for payment,
before the claimant arrives thereNote: The Accounts & Cash Sections are in the same
room
