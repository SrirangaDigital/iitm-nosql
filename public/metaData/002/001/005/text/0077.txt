Golden, ever Golden,
Blame, men-Â· foremost.
Tongue wags and brags
Their iaolts even hinted
Like angered snakes hiss
Tongue, words high pout..;
Silence flags, feeble show;
Blows, stabs, murders prevail
If the parties brutal be.
In pluck's name some,
Words vulgur give,
What, shame comes,
Reckon not before.
Schemers, silence keep
But brethren to cheat.
Saints, quiet adore
But for spiritual store.
World's honour due.
Silence, thoughts strengthen
Irritability effective erases.
To Maker a mighty move.
