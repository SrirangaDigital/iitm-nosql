The Last Hour of the Morning
B. Madhusudan Menon. 111 B. Tech (Mech)

In the Indian Institute of Technology,
Where life is far from an orgy,
The morning hours consist of four,
The last being the biggest bore,
For this is the hour before the repast,
And Boy! It sure is a long way from breakfast,
Thinking of grub the minds of the students soar,
Had they more freedom they would also roar,
Just think of ali that food in the mess.
But alas ! it is such a long way to recess,
And so from the lesson all the minds wander,
Afld all the beads nod like that of a gander,
It is evident from the look on the lecturer's face.
That he is thinking of the good old days,
In days of yore he would have used a cane,
And it would have caused his students a lot of pain.
From these thoughts he awakens to the present,
Where for the student, life is more pleasant,
Of course the student should feel that the lecture is interesting,
But it is not so easy to keep pretending.
Suddenly as a bolt from the blue,
The lecturer gets a clue,
He realises at last the reasons for his pupils' behaviour,
And promptly acts as a benevolent saviour,
For after aU he was also Ii student once,
And now with probably a dozen sons,
Suddenly he makes a decision,
Which makes' him ignore the watch's precision,
With a sigh he lets off the class,
An action more appreciated than jazz.
And boy! The speed at which the students fiee,
Would put to shame an USAF Banshee!
