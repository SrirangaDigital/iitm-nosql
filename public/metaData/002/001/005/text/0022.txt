INDIAN INSTITUTB OF TECHNOLOGY, MEDRAS

Excellency Dr. H. Lubke, President of the Federal Republic of Germany
visited us to lay the foundation stone of the Institute on the 3rd of
December of 1962.
With the completion of about 200 quarters, the staff moved into
the campus ill January 1963. Thus community - campus life, which is
one of the ~ain objectives of the Institute, got going in 1963.
The Institute has its own water supply, electricity, drainage, and
conservancy systems. A marketing centre, a post office, a branch of the
State Bank of India, a primary school were also provided for. The Institute runs its own internal transport system with a small fleet of 3
buses. We have a Medical Officer and a small dispensary. According
to our present programme. the entire construction of instructional buildings with the exception of the Administrative and Library blocks, will
be completed by March 1964.
A major portion of the equipment has also arrived from Germany.
Post-graduate courses have been started in Physics. and Engineering leading to the Master's Degree. Research work has also commenced. In the
next couple of months, the institute would really be in full swing.
The sudden' Chinese aggression on our northern border in 1962
posed a challenge to the Institute as it did to the wh01e of the country.
The fourth and fifth year of the Five-Year integrated course were
accelerated (shortened by six months) while a separate 3-Year degree
course for the B. Sc. students was also inaugurated.
The I. I. T.Madras has made perceptible progress during the 4 years
that have gone by since its inception. With hope, fortified by our
conquest of all our teething troubles, we look forward to our Institute
becoming a .lode star in technology. A dear dream would, then, have
come true.
