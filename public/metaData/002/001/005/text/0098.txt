THREE POEMS
E. S. Bhagiratha Rao

The Mystery
Who, in this hour.
Has filled a
Sense of Restraint,
Who, in all emotion,
Has kept a
Constant vigil,
Who, in all madness,
Has managed a
Lucid interval,
Who, in the name of Heaven,
Made Life f~r living
A labyrinthine blend
Must he be He
Or superman
Must he be yet a Mystery?

The Night
The Night that slumbers is never silent.
Never at rest, and never at peace;
The Night is dark, dear and dreadful
For those whose true colours at night release.
The Night is thrilling for lovers to love.
The Night is dear for splendid moonlight,
A time unforgettable for innocent men
Who do not plunder its dark delight.
The Night is so tragic for lovers apart;
But the villainy you witness is not of the Night,
It is of the men with crooked minds
What wreck the peace and bring the plight.
