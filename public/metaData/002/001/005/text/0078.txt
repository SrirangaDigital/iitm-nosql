Destiny Steers Ambition
D. D. Samuel, V. B. Tech .â€¢

T dwelled in a tower of imagination with unpardonable pride of
a scholar considering my prospects as the Director of International
Federation of Engineering Experts. The mere thought of it elevated
me to such heights of pleasure and mirth that I became deaf to the
call of the postman at the door. A registered letter was handed
over to me. With an optimistic enthusiasm I considered it as the
fulfilment of my hopes. Of course it was, but not entirely. Having
remained jobless for eleven months I had no real intention of
celebrating an unemployment anniversary. To that extent it was
a welcome; but in comparison with the infinite dimensions of my
imaginative castle this piece of information was an insignificant
infinitesimal. It was an appointment order for the Post of Junior
Technical Assistant in Institute of National importance.
With. imaginations interrupted and pride hurt I wa5 on the
horns of a dilemma. To remain imagining for ever or to suffer
as a ITA for life. This was a decisive moment in my life being
presented with the task of choosing between two horrible evils.
I chose the later -Gust as all wisemen do) for it was the lesser of
the two evils.
Never in my life had I climbed a platform to address an
audience. I had no idea of ways of winning the Students' heart.
I thought I'll launch a successful programme in an original fashion.
With this hope, dressing myself very smartly to my own standards
(which I later discovered was not only low but funny) I made a
'Gala Grand Entry' into the II year lecture hall in which there
were about 120 students. I was surprised at the pin-drop silence
I commanded. It was a few seconds later when I found that
none of them had taken notice of my entry. They were all busy
in their own thoughts! I tried to cough and clear my throat and
make my presence felt. I miserably failed.
