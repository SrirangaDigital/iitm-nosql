There has, in recent times, been a considerable amount of
lively discussion, if not controversy, on the subject of our requirements of technical personnel in different fields of enginecring, training programmes best suited to them, facilities tlierefor and employment opportunities to absorb them on qualification after training. In
order to view these factors in their proper perspective, it is necessary to examine our present state of industrial development vis-a-vis
the industrial position obtaining in the pre-independence India.
During the second World War, it became apparent even to the
then Government of India that if India were to survive in an Industrial Age, it would have to depend on her own indigenous manufacturing potential. It became quite clear that the war-ravaged

This phenomenal expansion can properly be gauged only if

tons in 1947 to over 6 million tons now and is expected to attairl
a target of 13 million tons by 1966. In the automobile field we
