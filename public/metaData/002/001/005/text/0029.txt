The Kennedy Effect
T. S. Ananthu
On the 25th of November, 1963, in the Southern part of the United
States, a young man was watching President Kennedy's funeral on a
Television set along with his family. During the pro:eedings, his fatherin-law made some uncomplimentary remarks about the late President.
The young man got so wild that he took a gun anj shot his father-in-law.
Of course, as usual, he then shot himself.
The above incident goes to show how the influence of President
Kennedy had infiltrated into practically every family throughout the
world. Of course, I admit this particular in :ident is an extreme case.
But it cannot be denied that the assassination of the United States'.First
Citizen did cause turbulence, in varying degrees in the minds of millions
and millions of people.
As the shock and horror of the murder is subsiding, it is now time
we sit down coolly and calmly and examine W:1Y the death of one single
man - that too, only 46 years old - produced such a lot of tumult all
over the world. Why and how is it that people from aU parts of the
world, and with aU shades of opinion, were wonder-struck by his personality, which everyman, friend and foe alike, described as striking and
attractive? In other words, what is this" Kennedy effect" ?
For purposes of analysis, it would be convenient to split up this
Kennedy effect into three parts - the effect during his presidency, the
impact of the assassination on the world, and the possible effects in
the future. Let us analyse them one by one.

The effect of Kennedy's assumption of Preiidency is of histone importance. This can be understood by examining the revolutionary
changes brought about by Kennedy's taking over the reins of administration.
