that in Black & White E. A. Olia's ''THE DESTINIES I DRAW'Â·

repectively.
In colour, the entry ''THE DAILY DEFEAT BYL. K. Sharma

received a certificate of merit.
The Institute also participated in the same competition in 1962-63
and our entries received several prizes in colour.
The first Inter-Collegiate Photographic Competition organised by
the Fine Arts Committee, I.I.T., Madras was held in December 63.
Quite a number of Colleges responded to our invitation. The home
team bagged the trophy by obtaining maximum points. I hope the members of the committee would agree with me when I say that the standard of the entries received was high and encouraging. I am grateful
to E. A. Otia, C. V. Sahasranaman, J. M. Anand, S. S. Chandak
and our vigourous P.T.I. Shri P. K. Jacob for the pains taken in setting up the exhibition. I am indebted to the members of the staff who
really took interest in contributing entries to the exhibition and made it
a success.
I would like to take this opportunity to thank Dr. D. Venkateswarlu the indefatigable President of the Institute Gymkhana
for his encouragement and constructive suggestions and Dr. V. Srinivasan of Chemistry department for his helpful guidance every now and
then throughout.
