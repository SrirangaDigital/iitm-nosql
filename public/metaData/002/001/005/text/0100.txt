Superstition
M. Vikram Rao
Recently I overheard a European remark loftily to his compatriot, as they were walking down a New DeIhiÂ· street, "These Indians!
They are such a terribly superstitious lot; positively disgusting." Even

interesting to speculate why, following the same reasoning, diving
into a pond was not considered unlucky, for in effect, it meant the same
thing.
In England, a child will normally never be initiated to school life
on a Thursday. The reason for this can possibly be traced to the
Bible, since it was on a Thursday that King Herod ordered the extermi-
