India and Germany have, in my oplntOn, given tangible
expression to these two thoughts in the establishment of this
higher institute of leammg 10 Madras, under a plan for co*
operation and assIstance, which stems from centuries old
cultural ties between the two countrIes and is indicatIve of
future endeavours also.
As the representative of the German Government in Madras
1 conSIder it to have been my prIvilege to have witnessed the
gradual growth of this institution right from the blue-print
stage some 4 years ago and to have played some part in this
interesting and most useful development.
The future of tire liT is paramount in the minds of both
statesmen and administrators in Germany - as evidenced by
the recent viSIts. I can only say that if past records should be
any indication, the future of the institution is indeed g010g to
be bright ~nd all those who are associated with the institution
in one way or the other can look forward WIth confidence.
The task that the lIT has before It IS a shared task 10 which
Germany will contmue to show a whole-hearted desire to
achIeve accomplIshment.
My term of office in MadraS" will soon come to a close and
it is not but with a little sadness that I can bnng myself to
bid goodbye to persons and places around me. May I take
thig. opportunity to say farewell to the members of the board
of management, members of the teaching staff, administration
personnel and the student community and to convey my
smcere good wishes for the continued growth and success of
the lIT.
