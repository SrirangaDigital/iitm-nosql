But "the big question still remains-Are the hopes of lasting peace
also no more? Were these hopes also assassinated along with Kennedy?
The answer to the question can be obtained only by predicting the
effect of Kennedy in the future.
Kennedy's death has given opportunities to certain opportunists to
try and exploit the situation. For example, President Ayub Khan is
leaving no stone unturned in trying to make the new Administration
lean towards Pakistan. Whether"America will be able to successfully
w.ithstand the pressures exerted by people like Ayub will depend on the
courage and firmness of President Johnson. "
In his eagerly awaited address to the joint session of Congres$,
President Johnson said nothing new, but merely dedicated his administration to Kennedy's policies. He made no new promises, he formulated no new policies he had no new pledges. But yet, the entire world
heaved a sigh of relief. The reason is that all sane and reasonable men
throughout the world, to whatever class, caste, colour or ideology they
may belong, appreciate, if not agree with, Kennedy's policies and
action. Kennedy or no Kennedy, the effect of Kennedy must survive,
if mankind is to survive. Therefore mankind now looks forward to
Khrushchov, Johnson and other leaders of the world to make a reality
of the great hopes of lasting peace, liberalism, equality, fraternity and
co-existence that had been generated as a consequence of the effectpeshaps the greatest and biggest ever in the history of the world - of
one single individual-lohn Fitzgerald Kennedy.
