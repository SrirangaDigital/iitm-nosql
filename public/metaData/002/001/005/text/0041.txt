FIFTH ANNUAL NUMBER

Hands in pocket, smiling, Soapy stood.
"Where's the man that done that" quoth the cop.
~'See you not I might have" Soapy said,
Friendly but with sarcasm, as one
Would greet a tum of fortune good. But no.
Would ever a window smasher wait and smile
For parley with minions of law 1 He left.
Soapy, twice unsuccessful, .now walked
Into a modest cafe, ate his fill.
"Now, call a cop; a coin haven't I,"
He told the waiter, " No cop for you "
He said, and called.. The next was - Soapy felt
Himself, rising joint by joint
From that callous pavement. Waiters two
Had pitched him neatly on his ears. He beat
The dust from clothes. Was arrest a rosy dream?
He travelled far before his courage gave
Leave again to capture, woo. A Cinch!
A modest girl of pleasing guise he saw
Gazing at a show-window; across,
A large policeman, severe, leaned against
A water plug. Now he did play the role
Of an exe_rated 'masher' ; set his hat
At killing cant and sidled t'ward the belle,
Made eyes at her and coughed and smiled and smirked.
Glad was he, the cop was watching him.
She moved away a little, stood and gazed.
Soapy followed, boldly stepped to her side,
Raised his hat and said, "Bedelia, there,
Don't you want to come and play in my yard 1"
The cop was looking still, and all she had
To do was just beckon a finger; sure
Soapy could be on his way to the isle!
Right little, tight little isle!
She faced him, stretched a hand and caught his sleeve ;
"Sure Mike. Blow me to a pail of suds".
She played the clinging ivy to Soapy's oak.
The cop they pl\ssed and gloomy Soapy grew.
