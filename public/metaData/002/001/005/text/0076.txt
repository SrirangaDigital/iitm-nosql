Lullaby
A. Anantha.Rtuna 1yer
Child, sweet sleep.
Face thine Heaven reminds,
Innocence two orbs beam,
In thine sleep peace peals;
Heaven in Thee abides.
Our sinfulness chides
Seer and Thee agree
Very God's pedigree.
To Thee he bows
None, Thee hates
When adolescence dawns,
Thine innocence fades;
Passions low prevail,
Which we poor curtail.
Wealth and station puff
Virtues' very handcuffs.
Men scheme and hate
Piety feeble feels,
Sympathy, native congeals.
Who childhood forgets not
Grace Heaven's sure got.

Silence
What venom tongue spills
Man and man kill
Silence men seldom keep,
In quarrels many weep
Gossip, most pleases,
Revel in teases.
Silence, many a quarrel save
Peace's path sure pave.
