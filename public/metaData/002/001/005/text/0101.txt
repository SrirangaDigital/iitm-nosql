the prophet Moses. The superstitious dread still pervades the
minds of other wise level-headed people of the jet age, that the day
would be an unlucky one. It is also another superstitious belief,
that the appelirance of a cornet protends the death of a prince or the
precipitation of a bloody war. Then, of course, after a war has begun,
there is always somebody to say that a cornet had been observed some
time before,
Many are the superstitious beliefs that have originated from
mvthology; Tn rural areas especially, superstiti(ln is more rampant.
Here the more simple minded f(llk 'believe imoliritlv in all that has

them of the futility of their beliefs; and they will quote various instances from what they consider as history, for. we like the Greeks. have

leaving shall be washed first, before those used by others I cannot
conceive of any religious motive behind this. I say this with the full
realisation that I am laying myself open to the risk of a deluge of irate
and possibly convincing arguments; though it is more likely that the
original reason for this belief has been lost in ancestry.
There are some people who are inherently superstitious as is proved
by the following curious incident. We were walking to the examination hall for our Annual examination. The morning's paper (part one
