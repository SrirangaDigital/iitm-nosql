On Faith.
T. Gopichand

A change in human beings-physically and mentally - is both imminent and imperative. They react to ideas, circumstances and situationsthe later two culminating often from the former. They reconcile,
adjust to or circumvent the new ideas. A static human society - static
in every respect - was never recorded in human history, not even dreamt
by the wildest Utopian. The ebb of human activity flows smoothly
bounded by faith.
Change in human beings is spontaneous and the reasons for such
motivation are unknown and unknowable. An young pers~!1 baftled by
situations encountered by him asks a wise old man • Who am I?'
•Wherefrom I have come? '. and 'What is all this business of huma~
existence?" The wise old man answers: 'Ever since the freak of intelligence dawned upon humanity man' has been asking the same questions. The questions were not answered and shall remain un-answered.
But faith which is the guiding rail on which ideas and ideals are put
on wheels, just exists. Faith is like an all pervading ether, the absence
of which is beyond all human comprehension.
Belief is akin to faith and faith includes .belief. Belief is more easy
to comprehend. It can be illustrated easily. Belief provides an anchor
for sailing the troubled waters of human life.
Belief in one's own capacities makes a life worth Jiving. Belief in
one's own country or society creates a virile nation.
Capacity to do a
particular thing or to achieve a particular goal is however, only one of
the facets of human activity.
Why should one have belief? A direct and complete answer cannot be given. Two stray and totally un-connected ideas present themselves to me for analysis and collation.
Mahatma Gandhi once said 'Let the wind blow from all directions
across your house. Keep your windows open, but let your feet be firm
