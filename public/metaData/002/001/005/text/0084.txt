"Fortune favours the prepared mind" ••••••Alexander Flemming :

Alexander Flemmingt the discoverer of Penicillin in 1929, in one
of his private talks with men of Science, was explaining to them, how
he got at the new discovery. His emphasis was that any true scientific
worker has to keep himself abreast with the amazingly expanding
vistas of knowledge in the different allied branches of Science and when
such a worker is equipped fully with sufficient intellectual fodder,
Dame Nature favours such a person only. Nature chooses to
release the new discoveries through such prepared minds· alone.
Alexander admitted that he did a lot of reding and laboratory work
and anybody in a similar situation as his, would have himself discovered
penicillin. He added that he did not therefore deem himself as an
extra-ordinary genius, who alone can tower eminently over the rest of
scientific fraternity and so discover the first antibiotic. This is a glorious instance of the sense of humility, which truly characterises every
great scientific worker, worth the name. ~lexander's pointed obser-·
vation of the need for more and more strenuous work - theoretical
and practical is nothing but an echo of the truth found
in Edison's definition of genius, as one who combines ninety-nine per
cent perspiration and one percent inspiration. Let us join hands and
sing with Longfellow, thus:
"Lives of great men, all remind us
We can make our liveS sublime,
And departing, leave behind us,
Foot-prints on the sands of Time."
