I have great pleasure in contributing a brief biography of the

could expect immediate assi~tance in the above direction, were all lying

realised at last that the cr~ing need of the hour was for training technical
personnel, especially at highter levels, with the utmost speed, to pilot
the long-delaye:l mdustrial revolution in the country.
A High Power Committee was set up under the Chaumanship of
the late Sri Nalini Ranjan Sarkar to go into the questIOn. The
Committee comprised 20 members drawn up from eminent scientists,
technologists, industrialists, representatives of the various Government
departments and the Armed Forces. The Committee was set the task

institution, possibly on the model of the Massachusetts Institute of
Technology (U. S. A.) with a number of Institutions affihated thereto or
a net-work of technical institutions on a regionol basis~ with reference
