mind is increased, the intellect is expanded and by which ODe can stand
on one's own feet ... The end of all education, all training, should be
man-making. The end and aim of all training is to make the man
grow."
"Physical weakness is the cause of at least one third of our miseries-,

men must b~ strong. Religion will come afterwards. Be strong, my
young friends, that is my advice to you."
