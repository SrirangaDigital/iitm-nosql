INDIAN INSTITUTE 0' TECHNOLOGY, MADRAS

The discovery of a skeleton, which has been identified to be that
of a dog, throws light upon the fact that the cave man had domesticated animals, especially dogs.
The drawing of a horse on a papyrus found in the cave is a clear
indication that he was not completely ignorant of the usefulness of the
horse.
The figures, both pictorial and numerical, on the papyri found in
the cave .show tJtat the cave man was great mathematician as well as a
book-keeper;
He might have been probably in other allied sciences also (this fact
will be confirmed soon after deciphering the inscriptions on the
papyri.)
The most surprising thing is that he had used ink, with such a
consistent at composition that no chemical reagent known so far could
erase its stain.
The broken pieces of various articles excavated throw evidence
on the unparalleled skill of the cave man in the manufacture of glass,
leather and rubber.
The discovery of paper models of the steamers and ships in the
cave made us surmise that he was not only an expert in navigation, but
an enthusiast of naval explorate too.........~
Investigation is being carried out for further enlightenment"â€¢
