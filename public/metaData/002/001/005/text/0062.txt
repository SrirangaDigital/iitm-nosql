Patriot and Prophet
V. K. VedapZlri

The auspicious day of Makara Sankaranthi on 12th January, 1863
heralded a new era in the spiritual history of mankind. For on that day
was born in Calcutta a child which was to "shake the world to its
foundations through the strength of his intellectual and spiritual
powers:'
He was named Vaireshwar, as he was bom in answ~r to prayerS to
Lord Shiva. Later he came to be called Naren or Narendra Nath and
to the world he was Swami Vivekananda.
Naren had in the blood; so to say, leanings towards spirituality.
Ram Mohan Dutta, his illustrious grand-father had renounced everything in quest of God. A man of sterling character and a friend of the
poor, Vishwanath, Naren's father, was a distinguished attorney of the
Calcutta Bar. Naren's mother Bhuvaneswari Devi was a typical model
of Hindu womanhood.
Naren was a sweet child. Even as a lad his bearing was regal.
intelligence astounding and memory prodigious. But there was in him
an unbridled restlessness. The wandering monks greatly attracted him
and he used to give them even the clothes be wore as alms! At his
strange behaviour his mother burst out often "I prayed to Shiva for a
son and he has sent me one of His demons."
From his early years Naren was impatient and wary of superstition
and fear. He could not accept anything that was not in tune with his
conception of Reality. He struggled to understand the 'why' and the
'how' of every phenomenon. He stunned Maharishi Devendra Nath
himself inquiring whether God could be Seen.
Once Pr,of. Hastie of Scottish Church College made a casual
mention of Shri Ramakrishna at Dakshineswar while explaining to his
students the mystic element in Wordsworth's poem "Excursion."
