INDIAN INSTITUTE OF TECNOLOOY, MADRAS

Was he doomed to freedom '1 Cursed spite!
He shook her off at the farther comer, ran
Till he reached a play house, saw a cop
Lounging grand. And Soapy caught the straw.
He danced and raved, and drunken gibberish yelled
But the cop had turned his back on Soapy, twirled
His club, and told a friend .u ~ Tis one of them
Hartford college Yale boys celebrating;

Soapy ceased this unavailing racket.
He muttered against the men with. helmets, clubs.

When he had thoughts of roses, mothers, friends,
And ambitions. He viewed, with horror swift,
The abyss he had tumbled headlong in,
The days degraded, motives base and hopes
That long were dead and wrecked faculties.
Yet in a moment did his heart respond;
The conjunction of Soapy's state of mind
A,nd influen~s of the old church wrought.
He was thrilled to the novel mood, and moved
By an impusle strong, to fight his fate.
Out of the mire he would pull himself
To make a man of himself once again.
And conquer evil which had hold of him.
He was young; and there was time to start
And find some work, a place: the Jlloming next:
