OUR LIBRARY.
The Institute Library which came into existence in lune 1959 was
housed in the third floor of the A. C. College of Technology, Madras.
It was there till August,1961 when. it was shifted to the Institute
Campus.
The western wing in the second floor- of the Civil- Engineering
block which it occupies now is a spacious hall measuring 170 feet. in
length and 30 feet in breadth. One half of the hall is the stack room and
the other half is reserved for current periodicals. readers and the staff. It
is provided with hugh windows on the southern side and big doors on
the northern side to let plenty of natural air and light and also. with fans
and tube lights. The reading room chairs, tables and periodicals stands
have been made by our workshop. As this is only a temporary location, the next shifting of the Library, it is hoped, will be to' its' own
building.
The staff at present consists of one Assistant Lidrarian, a Iunior
Technical Assistants, 2 Upper Division Cler~ 6 Lower Division Cerks,
