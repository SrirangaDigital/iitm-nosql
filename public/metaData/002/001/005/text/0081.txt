A Story of History
M. Venkateswara Rao
There was a ruined cavern on the outskirts of a very
old city. Spiders ·and bats were the only residents of the great
cavern and school children were the only frequent visitors. The
latter used to come every evening to play in the interior and to
enjoy the kaleidoscopic sight of the fish in the pond inside the cave.
They were so fond of the cave that they had embe11ished its
walls with all sorts of sketches and scrib blings of chalk or charcoal,
and made it a store-room for various. articles like dolls, broken
glassware and other fancy goods, with which they would
conduct their games.
On evening, a group of children was intensely immersed in
their usual sport and frolic. One small boy was making
paper-boats to let them sail in the pond; one little girl was
having fun with her friends out of the drawing of a pony she
had made in the classroom; a bony puppy was playing with a rubber
ball at the other end of the cave.
AU of a sudden', there was a tremendous thud and a
crash ...... A huge rocky mass had fallen down from the roof of
the cave with such a terrible noise as to be sufficient to freeze
the blood. The panic-stricken children had rushed out of the .cavern,
leaving every thing behind, even without noticing, the tragic death
of the young dog under the falling debris. No sooner they
had come out than the rest of the roof collapsed down flat ......

A geologist and a metallurgist were treading on the meadows
on the boundary of the same city. The latter had suddenly picked
up a stone glistening with a greenish tint.
"Here is the confimlation we are searching for"; he shouted
out delightfully. The geologist came to share his joy.
