The Newest Religion (A Short Story)
T. S. Ananthu
It happened before the Immigration Act came into force in Britain.
Jojo was one of those very many Africans who had heard all about the
"Paradise on EarthÂ·~ that exists in London. "All the women are white
and fair. In fact, even the beggars in the streets are white''', he was
told. And so he collected all the cash that he could, and someho.w
managed to land in London. However, .he soon discovered that the
only heavenly felicity that this Paradise could offer him was disappointment, and he soon settled as '''Cleaner and Assistant" to one Mr. James
Whitley.

Mr. James Whitley was in overall cha1'ge of the machines that
supplied electricity to a small suburb in London.. He held a peculiar
position - he was Engineer, Supervisor, Foreman, Attender as well
as worker - in short, he was "All in All" in his small installation.
You may think he hated being over worked. Not at aU! In fact
he hated to work with his fellow - countrymen, for he hated tlteir
way of life. Pe wasa highly practical man, who believed that machines
were the be-all-and end-all of life. He did not believe in an}'thing
ideal, including the Ideal Deity, but except of course the Ideal Carnot
Cycle.
Therefore, he was glad when he appointed Jojo as his Assistant,
for here was a man who would not sit' and think of Santa Claus and
Jesus Christ but would devote himself whole-heartedly to cleaning all
machinery. And further he liked beating and bullying his helper, and
he knew that only a Black -could stand that.
