DEPARTMENT OF APPLIED MECHANICS
The academic session started from June 1963 and along with the
courses handled by this department, a special course of lectures on
Machine Tool Vibrations was given to V. B. Tech., students. This
subject was handled by Dr. B. V. A. Rao who joined the department
from I. 1. T., Bombay. The department is also giving courses on
Elasticity, Theoretical Hydrodynamics, Mechanism, Lubrication and
Vibrations for the M. Tech., courses started this year.

U sua!

In August 1963, Dr. D. V. Reddy went on leave for a year as Asst
Professor in Civil Engineering at the University of Illinois.
Mr. S. Venketesan joined the department in October 1963. A special
feature in the activities of the Department is a series of seminars given by
the departmental staff on various topics every fortnight. One seminar
was started with the lecture by Mr. N. C. Swamy on "BOUNDARY
LAYER STABILITY".This was followed by Dr.B. V.A. Rao who gave
a talk on "A NEW TYPE OF VIBRATIONS DUE TO OIL FILM
ELASTICITY." The next lecture was by Mr. R. S. Alwar who spoke on
"BEAMS ON ELASTIC FOUNDATION". This was followed by
Mr. N. R. Rajappa who discussed the "EXACT SOLUTIONS OF
VIBRATIONS PROBLEMS OF ORTHOTROPIC PLATES" and
Mr. M. A. Veluswamy who spoke on "INTRODUCTION TO COMPUTING MECHANISMS."
The staff members engaged themselves in research work in addition
to their teaching work. The main fields in which research was conducted
are STRUCTURES AND FLUID MECHANICS.
Dr. S. R. Valluri joined the department as professor.
