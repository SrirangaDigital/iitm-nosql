INDIAN INSTlTUI'E OF TECHNOLOGY, MADRAS

indeed commendable, will be followed by those succeeding them.
This assnrance is necessary because their absence here will certainly
create a vacuum in every sphere of activity, which has to be filled by
their juniors. To borrow somewhat from Sir Wintson Churchwill never
have so few students done so much to establish the name of their
Institute.
We wish them all bright futures and would fondly hope to keep in
touch with them for they are the pride of this Institute.

The response to our call for contributions, which was rather
overwhelming, can be directly traced to the unusual importance of the
occasion. What strikes one is the fact that a number of final year
students have, at the hour of their maximum output of energy taken
time to contribute articles, no doubt, under the stress of sentimental
parting. While they have dealt with topics of a serious nature, perhaps
to leave a strong impression after them, the juniors have been more
down to earth in their attitudes as can be seen from the versification of
the "Travails of the Tummy" by Madhusudan Menon.
This year's issue carries a portrait gallery or the outgoing students,
a useful innovation which gives brief sketches of their careers as well as
general information such as their addresses. This practice, we hope,
will continue in the years to come though it will be a formidable job for
the future editors. The Annual numbers will hereafter constitute a
kind of family album which we can always pore over or frighten the
guests with.
