Notable items not yet available are the electron microscope~ X-ray
diffractometer, high temperature X-ray camera on the structural
metallurgy side and a cold working mill and a wire drawing bench in
the mechanical forming side. Some of the above may, however, be
shortly added to the department.
The department has pioneered a scheme for practical training of
under-graduate students which requires special mention. The final year
students under-go an intensive, plant-based training programme of
about 4-5 weeks, when they are placed in the charge of the technical
staff of leading metallurgical establishments of the country and study at
close quarters, the practical operational side of metallurgy. following
special lectures from the plant staff. The department had, this year,
the cooperation of Messrs Tata Iron and Steel Company, Hindustan
Steel Limited and National Metallurgical Laboratory in the implementation of this special type of training programme.
