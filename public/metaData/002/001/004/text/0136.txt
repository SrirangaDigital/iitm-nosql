BEPORT OF THE
ELECTRICAL ENGINEERING DEPARTMENT
The start of the academic year saw the Electrical Engineering
Department housed in its own quarters. A beginning was made by
occupation of the southern wing of the Electrical sciences block in
July 1962.
The Department, in the ma.in, is being organised with the
following divisions.
1.
2.
3.
4.

Electrical
Electrical
Electrical
Electrical

fundamentals and measurements
communication
Machines
power.

All the four divisions have been plannea to provide effective instructionaL facilities for under graduate and graduate students ma.joring in
Electrical Engineering.
Our laboratory facilities an much better and now pro'Tide
practical work for our students ma.joring in Electrical Engineering.
In the MUrse of time it is expected that we shall have a lot of
special equipment.
The fundamentals and measurements section, will of course be
equipped with modern measuring devices. In addition it will also
have special calibrating rooms where it will be possible to conduct
precision measurements. The Electrical Communication lab. is also,
expected to have special equipment such as Pulse Oscilloscopes,
Envelope Delay and Distortion measuring devices. Our Electrical
ma.chines section will be equipped with analog computers, Medium
frequency genera.tors, Frequency response measuring unit, Magnetic
amplifiers and the like, while our Electrical power section includes
a. High Voltage laboratory which will most certainly be one of the
biggest if not the biggest of its type in India.. This also includes
an air-conditioned chamber to help us conduct tests on equipment
under 'Varied climatic condit.ion.. This section also includes a relay
demonstra.tion laboratory, switch gear testing laboratory and modern
rectifier technology la.boratory.
In the year under review we ha.ve had ma.ny additions to our
staff. To oJl of them we edend a. hearty welcome.
