out passion 01' prejudice, without parochialism or provincialism
and without any assumed superiority of one part over the other
must be dispassionately presented to the outside world. Indian
history must be re-written so that any Indian reading it may
take a legitimate pride for her glory in the past and a correct
historical perspective of her past failures. It must command the
respect of all outsiders as a scientific document.

Was There Love?
N. Ramtsh

Was there love, my love,
In the swirl of your skirts?
And was there love;
In the way you walked?
And was there love, my love,
In the glance you cast?
One gnawing dou bt ;
Does dare to shout.
And if on thine,
Fair young ear
It be harsh;
Forgive met
Then, my fault,
Dear, as in eager haste t
I ask thee;
Was there love, my love;.
In the swirl of your skirts?
And was there love I my love:
Tell me dear,
Just tbis once,
Was there love?
