Just a.s any infant organisation has teething troubles, our Association also has. We need quite 80 few amenities to make the association

continued, healthy and fruitful co-operation from all sections of our
Institute to make our Asllociation a purposeful and a living force
in ma.tters of social, cultural and sports interest.
