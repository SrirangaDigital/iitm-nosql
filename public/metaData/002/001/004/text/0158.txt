thick of the war and the least that we could do was to forget
about this completely.
On the 21st of January, we were treated to a monoacting
performance by Shri N. Sundaram, a veteran monoactor who
presented scenes from popular Shakespel'ean pIa,ys.
On the 26th January, our boys presented" The Adventure of
the Mazarin Stone" directed by C. Krishna. The actors were
V. Siddhartha, R. A. Yaswani, S. N. Bukht, S. Nageshwar and
R. P. Loomba. We also had a new feature this year. An Annual
Music Competition was held the samE.' evening at our famed Open
Air Theatre. We were very fortunate in having Mrs. Sengupto,
Mrs. M. V. C. Sastry and Mrs. Klein as judges. R. Venkates·
waran was adjudged first and he was followed by K. S. Krishna·
Murthy and K. M. Kripanarayanan.
In between all this, on the 18th February, staff from the four
InstItutes and the College of Engineering and Technology at
Delhi were here with us and we took the opportunity of treating
them to tea in the evening followed by a lively entertainment
programme.

Our Institute Day is close at hand on the 11th March 1963.
We expect to present a programme of variety entertainment.
In conclusion, I would like to take this opportunity of thanking Dr. D. Venkateswarlu the very efficient President of our Insti·
tute Gymkhana for all his help. I would be failing in my duty if
I did not thank Shri N. V. Chandrasekharaswamy whose unbounded enthusiasm could not even be matched by our students.
