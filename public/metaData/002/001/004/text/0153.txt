INDIAN INS1'ITUTE OF TECHNOLOGY EMPLOYJl.:ES
CO-OPERATIVE BUITJDING SOCIETY, MADRAS

The 1. I. T. Employees Co-operative Bnilding Society Ltd. wu
formed in the year 1960 for the pllrpO'le of acquiring 8JHl making
availa.ble to the members of staff cheap house sites in a developing
neighbourhood of the City where they could eventually build their own
houses. The Collector of Ching\eput originally agreed to a.ssign to
the Society a. site of lOl acres nea.r Tarubara.m. But while finalising
the proposals, it was found that the President of the local Pa.nchayat
Board very strongly objected to the alienatIon of the site consequent
on rapid development in that area.. The population of the City
a.ccording to the latest estimates framed by the Government is
increasing at an &Terage rate of one lakh a. yea.r and it is expected that
there wioJl be a horizonta.l development around the City up to a limit
of at least 10 mile.. It was with this .,iew that when the alternative
site was offered by the Collector in 1962 very near the previous site
at a reasonable price the Society readily agreed to accept the sa.me
a.s per the decision of the General Body meeting convened in July,
1962. These proposals are now pending with the Collector of
Chingleput as per information received in Revenue Divilional Officer's
letter da.ted 29. 1. 6S. It is hoped tha.h these proposa.ls will be finalised
Boon and the land will be handed OTer to the Society before the end
of Ma.rch, 1963. The proposed laRd ia located at the 9/4,h mile of the
Velachery Road i.e. about 7 miles from the Institute Vela.chery Gate.
The loca.lity is connected by buses plying every half hour and is
fast developing, with the introduction of electric traction up to
Villupuram, besides full a.menities like school, market, energy etc.
a.vaila.ble 't'ery near the spot. The Society has at present 84 members
on its roll.
