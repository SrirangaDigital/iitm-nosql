The Depa.rtment of Mochanical Engineering sends its hea.rty
good wishes to tbe Institute Gymkhana., for succcess in its venture
to bring out an ANNUAL, featuring the progress in the various
sections of OUr Institute.
During the session unclel' review, a.dditional members han> joined
our staff. We are happy to say tbat Dr.-Ing. Gunter Stabl haa
joined us as Professor of Internal Combustion Engineering. To
them, we extend IL bearty welcome.
OUI workshop facilities have been enhanced and extended to
cover training in electrical insto.llation, foundry, welding and
advanced fitting. A cupola is UndtlI erection, and is expected to be
completed shortly. Training facilities in machine, carpentry, and
fitting shops are upto date, and perhaps, are second to none in
this countlÂ·Y.
For the benefit of the third year stUdents, during the last
academic session, a general machines laboratory was rigged up in
a very short time, in one of the workshop bays and an intensive
two-week course was given to the students. The laboratory
course included I.C. engines, pumps, drives and materials handling equipment.
The Department ha.s expanded its scope and activities during
the current session, though on a. limited scale. Consequent to the
gra.dua.tion of tbird B. Tech. students to fourth yea.r class, additional
facilities ha.d to be provided in respect of laboratories. Owing to
the paucity of building construction work in respect of workshop
type laboratory ba.ys. and other a.lIied amenities. equipment could
not be installed. However, a ma.keshift arrangement has been
ma.de to provide Ia.boratory instruction facilities. When the I.C.E.,
Steam and other laboratories are fully csb,blished during the course
of the next few months, the final year students will be required to
take an intensive COt1rRC of short d\1taticn in la.horatory work t
towards the end of this year.
