The Department of Mechanical Engine(}ring sends its hearty
good wishes to the Institute Gymkhana, for succcess in its venture
to bring out an ANNU AL, featuring the progress in the various
aections of our Institute.
During the session nnder review, additional members have joinea
our staff. We are happy to sa.y that Dr.-lng. GUnter Stahl has
joined us as Professor of Internal Combustion Engineering. To
them, we extend & hearty welcome.
Oar workshop facilities have been enha.nced and extended to
oover training in electrical insta.llation, foundry. welding and
advanced fitting. A cupola is undar erection, and is expected to be
completed shortly. Training facilities in machine, carpentry, and
fitting shops are upto date, and perhaps, are second to none in
this country.
For the benefit of the third year students, dul'ing the last
academic session, 11 general machines laboratory was rigged up in
a very shod time, in one of the workshop bays a.nd an intensive
two-week course was given to the students. The laboratory
course included I.C. engines, pumps, drives and ma.terials ha.ndling equipment.
The Department ha.s expanded its scope and activities during
the current session, though on a. limited scale. Consequent to the
gra.duation of third B. Tech. students to fourth year class, a.dditional
fa.cilities ha.d to be provided in respect of laboratories. Owing to
the paucity of building construction work in respect of workshop
type la.boratory baya. a.nd other a.lIied 8Jllenities, equipment could
not be installed. However, a. ma.keshift a.rrangement has been
made to provide Ia.boratory instruction facilities. When the I.C.E.,
Steam and other la.bora.tories are fully esta.blished during the course
of the next few months, the final year students will be required to
take a.n intensive cour!<e of short dnraticn in lahoratory work,
iowards the end of this year.
