The Ame-fiean's and the Russian's disbelief at the Sino-Indian
border war may look strange to us, but a close examination will

To expand the country has been the basic policy of all
Chinese rulers from time immemorial. Necessity is the mother

Chinese to invent new claims to different lands. Originally,
China consisted only of what is now called "China Proper".
The territories of Tibet, Sinkiang, Manchuria and Inner Mongolia
were not part of China. But, by and by China incorporated
them all into herself. However, the need for more land did not
