Our Library
G. YZlWonathan

Can I forget the mansion fine
That stirs to life at half-past nine?
It starts to work when students learn,
And promptly closes when they return.
This spacious hall of knowledge great,
With books in plenty up-to-date
Spares its tomes from human moths
And veils their charm in gory swathe.
Books --are not issued and lie unused
Still tickets ten are always issued.
Authors on their racks of steel
Their diurnal peace do deepy feel.
New OI),es wait to be classified
On dates that are never specified.
Some-like phantoms easily flit
From shelf to shelf in a jaunty fit.
Milton meets the metallurgist
Hahn with Joan keeps his tryst.
Eves of lette-rs lie on Science
And beget odious nescience.
Books on Applied Mechanics
In easy amour mate with classics.
Physics and Maths and Chemistry
Lie deeply buried in history.
Thus in promiscuous chaos
Masterminds th~il' hours pass.
Let me cry a halt to my tune.
It's time for me to pay my fine.
