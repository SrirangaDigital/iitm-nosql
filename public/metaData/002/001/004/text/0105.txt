FOURTH ANNUAL NUMBER

83

Whether I stand guar-d of treasures or not, my stay in some
houses keeps the place safe from even dac(Jits. What the good
earth yields as harvest reaches the granary in a better proportion since no rodent comes neal' where I crawl-Even Ulen do not
transgress paddy fields at night -fearing me-.
My name when associated with medicines surely commands
respect-Serpa pills and Redolphia Serpentina plants enjoy a good
market-If the far easteTn indigenous medicine shops do a roaring
trade in dispensing all-cures; you can take it that my carcass
has a due share in the prescriptions under various allotropiQ
modifications.
The poison that I hold, corrects many a human ill if only
used in homeopathic doses.
The Aryaui who certainly know what they did, gave me a
lliace of importance \ Right now, the tourist in India admires the
Taj but feels the visit incomplete without a sight of my swaying
hood keeping rhythm with the wailing note of the Charmer's pipe.
I am not at all pedestrian in my habits and keell myself
clean and shining ~las I that is my undoing too-Vulgar hands
are quick to flay me and change me as her vanity bag or his
waistbelt and my only satisfaction is that price is better than
other hide.
Even the little lebensraum in which I contain myself is
disturbed by entomologists who.advocate, use of detergents and
acids to dri ve me into the open where I could be done away
with as nobodys business. They want to take up exactly where
Janamejaya left the job unfinished.
But if only men think of pets and cases of hydrophobia
caused by them, I would be considered as an angel by comparison
-For as a medium of exit from life can any beat me-a quick
incision and paralysing of the nerves-the moment of truth is
there.
In spite of all that is said. it behoves you to keep your
eyes open when I am near, and meantime as aloof to you as Y0l:l
are to me and wishing never to draw near.
