Man rt'alist's his own weakness and his
state of he-lplessness only when he is face
to face with adversity. It is only the
brave and the strong who can face it with
fortitude.
Let us, thereforfl, in this hour of crisis
resolve that we will shed all fear and do
our duty by our country. Let us further
resolve that we will do our work to the
best of our ability and leave others to do
theirs in their own way. We will help
our comrades in case of need-and will not
thwart their efforts by pointless criticism.
