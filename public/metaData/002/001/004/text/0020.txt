Why did the Chinese Attack Us ?
T. Sâ€¢ .d.nanthu

An American student was sipping tea in a restaurant in
Milwaukee along with an Indian classmate.
'. You know u the American remarked, as the discussion
drifted to politics" I don't quite believe reports that the Chinese
have attacked India."
"What do you mean'? n asked the surprised Indian. "Don't
you believe your own news agencies? ..
"Ha. well ..... the American shrugged his shoulders in
perfect Milwaukee style. ., But it looks odd, you know, that the
Chinese should attack you. After all, you would anyway hav~
turned Red within a couple of years. Kerala and West Bengal,
I was told, were already on the verge of having Communist
Governments. Why, your people gave Krishna Menon a majority
of more than hundred and fifty thousand votes? What more
proof do you want to know that India was turning Red. And
then Mao spoils all the game by snatching some unpopulated
hilly areas! No, I don't quite believe it n.
On about the same date, a Russian worker was sitting in a
cafeteria in Moscow with an Indian journalist. He had a copy
of the day's" Pravada .. in his hand, and was reading it in exactly
the same way as a christian would read his Bible (in Russian
"Pravada" means" Truth to), believing, assimilating and diges~
ting each and every word appearing in its columns. In one page,
there was an article on Indo-Soviet friendship, the next column
contained one on China's tremendous progress, and the third one
contained a brief account of the fighting in the Himalayas. The
Russian was bewildered. He could not understand how two
Socialist countries were at war, and, making use of the freedom
of the Khrushchev era, said so openly to his Indian friend.
