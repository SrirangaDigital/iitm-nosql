PERENNIAL

FLOWER~'

Let a thousand flowers bloom
Yet all but one will die
This is the Chinese dictum
That Mao and Chou stand by
No contact with the U. S. A.
Till they vacate Formosa
And all the off-shore islands
All those wat81'S and lands
They claim to know no aggression
And work to ease tension
But of many a border state
With China rests the fate
Like offing. China's border line
(To mark it is but vain)
For as the Chinese proceed
Farther does it recede
The Lamas with their prayer wheels
Have taken to their heels
The world watching in aWf\ and dread
What else would Chou not tread
Our country's northern border shrank
Before the Chinese prank;
But how to raise aastion bold
Against a comrade old ?
For did we not in hoary past
When over mighty hills
Came Huien Tsang with wisdom vast
Payoff his heavy bills?
But further south their banner came
With excuses all lame
Till at last the giant rose
To meet the move so gross
Of .. Hindi Chini Bhai Bhai .,
The echo dead well-nigh
Is lost on one and all
Beyond the mountain wall,
The beacon light that China bore
Aloft in days of yore,
Shining all the world OVer
Is gone out for ever.
