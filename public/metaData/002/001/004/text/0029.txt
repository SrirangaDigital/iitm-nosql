Oh! Fair Maiden,
With WOl'l'y,Â·and care,
My heart is laden,
For in every
Ret.iring rest;
A.s the Sun
Sinks vVest;
Far off! I see.
A rolling plain,
Of Life!
And myself,
In the Sunset,
Of my span!
And soft words;
Falter at my feet;
Like, drops of honey,
From the busy hive
Of aging time.
Ah! These words,
which so long;
Stayed with me.
These words;
That gave me;
A thirsty desire,
And was a jewel;
Bright and gleaming,
Gleaming in
The murky depths
Of a ra vaged mind,
These words w hleh
Seem to take
So long, in delay,
Ere I speed them on,
To you t To you l
