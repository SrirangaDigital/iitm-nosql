THE ATOM
S. Sreenivasan

The Greeks discovered the atom
Rutherford split the atom
Hahn got its fission
And Teller then its fusion.
The might of atom then became
A weapon in the miltary game
Two drops on an enemy found
Two of his cities under tomb.
The cold war carried the atom
To the politic.iansÂ· bottom
They play their game with it
N ever feeling its danger a bit.
So they tested many bombs
Without caring for their wrongs
In poisoning the atmosphere
Around this living sphere.
The power that vanquishes others here
Must plant its men elsewhere
A count of ten will be longer than
When our earth will be now here.
Goneva talks or some other talks
Whether are talks or no such talks
Out of doubt should we walk
Away from this deadlock.
The powerful atom is useful sure
When harnessed with objects pure
Who can deny the utility
Of a mighty inanimate entity?
The evil is not sure in the atom
But is at the sadist's heart bottom
fhe Hyde in Man is alone to blame
If the world dies in atomic flame.
