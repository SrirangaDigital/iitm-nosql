INDIAN INSTITUTE OF TECHNOLOGY, MADRAS

Heaven from Hell (i) Herr Hitler (ii) Sir Robert Clive (iii)Alexander,
the Great (iv) Napoleon and (v) Akbar. The above mentioned five
will lead the al'my to the borders. Further Dr. John Woods and
Mr. Scudder are also promoted to take charge of the medical and
technical responsjbility respectively."
While we were thus reading all this news we heard people
entering. We sto~d up. We could clearly heal' they were near, but
couldn't see them. One by one they introduced themselves to us
and said that they constitute the society of "Invisible Intei.
lectuals." A grand dinner was served to us. Everyone of them
expressed his views on the border trouble and everyone spoke to
our advantage. One of them praised us saying" We appreciate
your patience in dealing with this matter 80 that India will no1;
be responsible for the outbreak of a world war". I learnt this
was .the first time " They" met the mortals.
We were led through se:veral rooms. Finally they took us
to a workshop whose doors were locked. On them were written
in gold
•
.. 0 Shame to men I devil with devil damned,
• for his destruction wait! "
After sometiUl3 we were let in. To our great surprise we found all
the" stolen" equipment of India. There they were being utilised
along with other goods. They were producing machine guns,
tanks, ships, jet fighters etc. In another room we found the
rockets and the bombs in production. That was the workshop
of H~aven! The society of invisible intelleotuals expressed their
happiness to render in any help, since we were just and right.
They explained to us how these rifles and other things would be
lllanned (or ghosted) by spirits so that the enemy would really
be baffled.
We thanked them for the help which they had themselves
to give. By this time Mahatma Gandhi, who was
fast asleep in Heaven, had woken up and had learnt that two
Indians were there, He couldn't help coming and ialking to us.
