Indian cl'icket had struck the reef. No touring team, not
even the formidable M.C.C. under the ruthless Jardine in 1933-34,
had achieved such sensationalsuecess as Gen'Y Alexander's West
Indians during the 1958-59 ~l'icket season. With Gilchrist going'
great guns and Ha1l gathering a harrowing harvest of Indian
wickets, claiming between them 56 out of the 94 wickets that'
fell in the five Test matches, the Caribbean cricketers had rocked
the very Â·foundations of Indian cricket with the violent velocity
of a hungry hurricane, tearing off 10 of the 17 matches they
played ,without losing the rest.
Amidst all this dismal debris of disappointment, the intrepid
displays of Chandu Borde, nicknamed the "Panther" by the
Lanchashire Leaguers for his agility on the field, no matter
whether batting, bowling or fielding, stood out in refereshing
contrast. Almost like the mythical 'phoenix did he rise from
the ashes of Indian cricket, with seOl'es of 56, 109 and 96 in his
last three Test innings of the season, missing, by the proverbial
coat of varnish, the fabulous feat of scoring a century in each
innings in a Test match, performed only once before for India
by Vijay Hazare against Australia in the Fomth Test at Adelaide
in 1947. It is only cricketers of character who can rise above the
inevitable first run of failures and it was precisely this that Borde
did. With scores of 7, 0 and 1:3 in the Bombay and Kanpur Tests
and not a single wicket in bowling and a sack staring him in his
face, Chandu was determined to "do or die". At Madras, Borde
rode the whirlwind of the West Indian pace attack to score 56
out of ,a team total or. 151 runs and paved the way for his two
mastElrly knocks at Delhi, which made the Almanac refer to his
as .. Horatius on the tottering bridge as each one of his comrades
