Mr. Geoffrey Tribe, who took over charge from Mr. Auty in
the middle of the session, can easily pass for an athletic coach.
He seems to have a built-in gyroscope that maintains his equilibrium during his speeches whenever he twists his body like a
contortionist. He somE.>how gives you the feeling that he has
one more exam. to pass. Those who ha va often heard himlecture at the British Coum'il Library in Madras, have learned to
love him for his sardonic humour; the delegates at Trivandrum.

The opening lecture was delivered, fittingly enough, by the
historian, Mr. John Hale of Oxford. The lecture was entitled
Thinking Historically" and aimâ‚¬'d at giving us a historical
perspective of the literary periods, the Augustan and the
Romantic. Mr. Hale is the youngest of the three musketeers;
he revels in speaking without lecture notes with the gusto of -a boy
on cycle calling out, "Look! No hands!" He has a boyish mop
of hair \l hich he often brushes back with his hand to appeal' about

No dull dog that the proverbial teacher of history proves to be,
Mr. Hale, with his zestful liveliness, not only caused some
agitations in the feminine hearts but won intltant converts among
the male delegates. His Public Lecture on Machiavelli was his
masterpiece. - Looking past the mere symbol of much that
is deceitful in politics, the historian took us to Machiavelli the
man, the gay young blade and the man of letters.
