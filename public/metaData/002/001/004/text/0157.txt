FOURTH ANNUAL NUMBER

lZ7

The Institute Annual Essay Competition was held on Tuesday
the 26th in the morning. This year a novel competition has been
started. This is the General knowledge test which was also held
on Tuesday.
With that comes the end of another year in the Literary
Activities of the Institute. This by far has been the most eventful and fruitful year. The Institute has had a pretty tight
schedule of literary events to keep the humanist traditions alive.
Certainly it can't be said of this Institute that it produces mere
Engineers and Technologists. The Literary successes certainly
have wider repercussions than that. I wind up this report with
my heartfelt thanks to all who by their li~tle EffJlÂ·ts have made
the year a successful one and in particular my thanks are due to
Dr. D. Venkateswarlu who really spurs the students on to greater
conquests by the generous help and encouragement that he's ever
ready to offer.
