FILM CLUB
1961 will remain a significant year in the HistOl'Y of our
Institute, since it marks the birth of the Film Club. The first
show was held on Sunday in October 1961. The projector, the
projectionist and the mem bers were all there, in that grimy
corridor in the central workshops and though all of .them failed
at val"ious times dUl"ing the show, it was a good start. That show
was the result of months of correspondence between us, the
various Film Distdbutors and of course the Institute authol"ities.
The next few shows were held just outside the Workshops,
where it was more airy and where Members could relax on the
grass or have the tlu"ill of seeing a picture from ladders, treetops and window-sills. But now the Film Committee was up
against a lot more difficulties than it had bargained for. rfhere
were several technical problems rt'garding projectors, screen,
electrical connections, etc. Most of these were overcome by the
sheer will-power shown by us and to a greater extent by the
determination of the members to see good. pictures. The. last
shows that year were held just before the Final Examinations
started.
1962-63 saw a more mature and expelienced Film Club.. It
knew the worst that could happen at a show, the proper thing to
be done when projectors, members and the weather were all
against it and lastly the psychology of the common picture-goer.
We started our shows in one of the smaller workshops, but as
usual, we always got whaÂ·t we did'nt ask for. We got bad weather
when the members had the unique opportunity of seeing pictures
while kneep-deep in water, and we always got either more or less
than 220 watts in the lines, when we we~t back to the 20's and
saw silent pictures.

Problems regarding projectionist, projectors and transport go",;
worse and many a time, members of the Film Committee have
had to drop the projectionist back at his home on private convey~
'lonce. We are grateful to Bawa and Mahesh In this respect. The
