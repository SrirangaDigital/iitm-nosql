very first match at Bombay, showed his possibilities by scoring
55 and 61 no~ oat. In his n(>xt season, he notched 134 runs against
Gujerat. He was then only 18 but there was, indubitably a good,
and gallant cricketer in the making.
When Borde, la~er, transferred his allegiance to Baroda, he
promptly hit up 110 runs against Bombay, their traditional rivals
in 1955. It was his consistent bowling that won Baroda the
coveted Ranji Trophy in 1957-he took 20 wickets at an average
6f 19. 35 runs.
Now a must for both Baroda and the Indian Test teams,
BOi'de has kept before him, Hazare as his model and mentor. He
has a penchant for the cut and is particularly puissant on the
legside, where his sweeps are graceful and pulls powerful. His
cover drive off the backfoot has the Hazare touch and class. It
was said of Ranjitsinhji, whom A..G. Gardiner once described as
the Plince of a small state but the King of a great game", that
.. he flicked- fours off his eyebrows." Similarly with Borde. fours
seem to flow from his bat, without any apparent effort. Besides;
he is a marvel at cover poil1t.

Leg spin bowlers are prone to be erratic at times and so
susceptible to losing length that Trevor Bailey once wrote in his "
Cricket Book" that" leg break bowlers are rather like that little
girl of the rhyme-when they are good, they are very, very good-,
but when they are bad, they are horrid." But not so Borde. He
kBeps an extraordinarily good length for a- slow bowler and, on his
day, can put an entire team to the flaming sword with his leg;.
breaks and googlies.
Borde is young and strong and with Salim Durrani is sure to
be- the backbone of Indian Test teams for many a long year to
come. Yas-this is my toast to the Panther from Baroda.
