Now can you honestly klaim to have a bigger headache
than yours truly? Your charges may be lacking in grey matter
but they don't charge around trying to wipe themselves out.
Well, so long pal. Hope to see you before the end of th.is aeon.

P.S.: Been to see my psychiatrist recently. He says I have
some sort of " K" komplex. Wonder how?

The Opium Den
Mohall

Lead me to that opium den, my Friend,
You said you'd discovered Friday last;
I would be away from men, my Friend,
Till the Earth and its all seem part of the Past.
I've drunk my Friend, and lain with women,
But these have proved but scant comfol-t.
Ah, let me try this opium den:
One trial at least; Oh sure it's worth.
Hashish may lead me out of Life and Death,
Hasten, my Friend, to Hashish let's on;
Let's take some incense to sweeten the breath
And a velvet cushion to recline upon.
Goodbye Self, I'll not know you again i
You'll never more haunt me in feverish dreams:
Goodbye, I'm off to the opium den
To dance with the Moon amid Stellar beams.
