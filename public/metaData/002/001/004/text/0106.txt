Je~l Before Justice
's. Srikant
The title may amuse you because you believe that a jest and
jacose, a sally and sortie are the monopolies of a jocund jester in
the circus arena 0'1' a comedian in a play or a picture; because
you presume that courts that administer justice are rooms where
wit and humour, retort and rejoinder have no place ,at all. When
you visualise a court scene, you picture before YOll an erudite
Judge seated on the raised dais with his serious looks and morose
appearance, the black-robed barristers who live on others'
quarrels, appealing to His Lordship'S passions and sympathies,
his prejudices and predilections to establish the cause of his
elient and destroy that of his adversary, and the lugubrious litigants anxiously awaiting the pronouncement of the c.ourt. It is
true the proceedings of the court are insipid and d.lll, and its
atmosphere, drab and dreary. Nevertheless, the tension of
tragedy and seriousness of the court atmosphere is broken by an
apt jesting or a. mild fun, a witty remark or a brief repartee, a
little joke or a humorous sally, a small yarn or a pithy anecdote.
Such humour 01' wit may emanate either from the Bench or from
the Bar, and more often times than not it is the witty witnesses
that bring in the smiling and laughter in the court and relieve its
ennui and monotony.
It is not uncommon that a smart witness may pun the leg of
the Counsel cross-examining him, however experienced the
.Counsel be. In one case, a carpenter was sub-poenaed as a witness
on a trial for assault. The Counsel who was much given to badgering and brow-beating of witnesses, asked hIm In tIle course of
his cross-examination, what distance he was from the parties
when he saw the accused strike the victim. The shrewd carpenter
answered: " Just four feet, five inches and a half". The Counsel
asked: "Pray. tell me, how is it possible for you to be so very
exact as to distance? " "Why, to tell you the truth, I thought.
