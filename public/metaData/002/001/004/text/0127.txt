Report of the activi,ties of the Department
of Applied Mechanics
Since ita {ormation in July 1961, the Depa.rtment of Applied
Mecha.nics bas grown steadily and made some progress in all the
three phases of academic work-Teaching, Research and Development. Subjected to the inevita.ble difficulties associated with a developing Imtitution planning of laboratoriel' proceeded rather slowly.
The Ddpa.rtment, was able to set up a ,ma.ll labora.tory for the
Mechanics of Rigid Bodies with both West G-erm8rn and locally
purchased equipment. Laboratories for the Mecha.nics of Dliforma.ble
Bodies and the Mechanics of Fluids an in their formative ,tages.
Although all the teaching commitments have been at the undergraduate level till now, the Department looks forward to an intensive
programme of postgraduate teaching from the beginning of the next
ac&demic year. As Applied Mecha.nics cuts acrOss all branches of
Engineering, the members of the sta.ff are drawn from various
disciplines and benefit from the consequent opportunities for the
craBs-fertilisation of idea.. This is bound to provide a healthy
atmosphere {or cl'eatj1'e work.
Inspite of the considerable responsibilities imposed by work
concerning teaching and development the members of the staff took
active interest in research and the Department is proud of its contributionll publi,bed in leading journals both a.t home aDd abroad,
