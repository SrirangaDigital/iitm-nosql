INDIAN INSTITUTE OF TECHNOLOGY, MADRAS

out to be an unforgettable pageant. The stadium shall serve as
a. fraternising centre where through art, drama and sports we
shall make life worth living for all of U8.
To these solid achievements we shall add OIle or two more.
The post-graduate classes in l'hysics and Math~lllatics have
been started and accommodation in the campus is provided for
those who have joined the course. The Science and Humanities
Block is coming up near the sylvan walk, rising like an aspira.
tioIl into the sky.
As for the Anllual Number it speaks for itst'lf. Some people
in baleful ace·ents frighten us by saying that the arts fight a
losing battle in OUl' technological civilisation and that they see
no hope for them. We shall not be unnerved by those raucous
voices. - The contributions to this number have exposed the
hollowness of this fear. We do not live in a golden age. This
is an age of gas. of atomisation. Still we have pI'oved that in
this campus a climate of SW(\{'Itness and light can be created. If
this number has ('ontribut{'d even in a small measure towards
aehif'ving this objectivt:', our efforts would have been amply
I·ewardt>d.
