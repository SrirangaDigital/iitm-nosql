KRISHNA KALEIDOSCOPE
The academic year 1962-63 saw the a.ppointment of Sri Gangadharan as our new Assistant Warden in the place of Mr. Sur
whose services were required in Narmada Hostel. Dr. Rama
Sastry continues as Warden an4 Mr. D. S. Subramaniam as Assistant Warden. Our sense of loss at Mr. Sur's departure was
alleviated by the cheerful personality of our new Assistant
Warden. Mr. Sur, however, apparently could not bear parting
from us, as he continued and still continues to reside in our
Hostel.
About the end of July the Direct Entrants into second Year
made their appearance. They however were the second batch of
"strangers within our gates" as previously some first years who
could not obtain accommodation in Narmada were allotted rooms
in our Hostel.
The elections for the office bearers in our hostel were held
on the 7th of August.
The following were elected:
