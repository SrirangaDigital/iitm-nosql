N~IGHBOUR

"T. S. R."
Rally round the flag, rally once again,
Shouting the battle cry of Mother Divine,
The tl'ee of liberty will grow and flowerOnly when watered by the blood of ours.
With sweet words covering hideous heart,
And death-dealing daggers concealed in yellow robes,
And sharpened claws to pierce our motherland's heart,
Had swarmed, the brute and treacherous hordes.
Too long have we fraternized with scheming foes.
Lulling us to sleep with Bhai-Bhai morphia,
With lines of treachery writ large on the bushy brows,
No longer the blood-thirsty wolves can ensnare India,
Sons of Ind, remember the heroes of the glorious days of old
Who fought for this land to bathe in freedom's fragrant showers
The cursed word of ' Slavery' shall on our land never
again be told;
Proclaim this to the heathens from the land of "Hundred
Flowers."
Our brethren on the borders braving blizzards and bullets for'
,
our Mother's fame
Face a foe unsurpassed in practice of diabolic deceit and art
and cunning;
Sons of Bharat, wake up from the illusion's slumber of shame,
Peace is hard to win with Chinese vipers bobbing out and in.
Let party strifes be cast away,
They dim the flame of Liberty;
Let caste and creed dissolve to-day
To form a mighty stream of Unity.
Victorious we shall ever be !
Very shape of our dear Motherland
Is a mighty V of Victory,
Cal'Ved out by the Great Creator's ha.nd.
