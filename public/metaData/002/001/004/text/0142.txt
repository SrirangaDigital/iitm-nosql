INDIAN INSTITUTE OF TECHNOLOGY, MADRAS

Liet. Genera.l Kumarsmangalam visited the Units and inspected
the parade on 16th Oct. '62 and he was very much ilnpressed by the
smartness a.nd turn·out of our cadets.
One Officer, One Senior Under· Officer. Two Under-Officers and
Sixty Cadets of our Unit participated in ~he Combined NCC, T. A.
Day celebration on 18·11- 62. Our Unit was chosen to lead 2 (M)
Group NCe Rifles.
On the occasion of the 'Visit of Dr. Heinrich Luebke, President of
the Federal Republic of Germany to ~he Institute. the NCCR had the
privilege to welcome His Excellency along with che Circle Commander
Commodore M. K. Heble and Group Commander Maj. P. K. D. Nair.
In view of the present border troubles, the NCC training has been
intensified from Nov. '62. The Cadets unanimously agreed to forgo
the refreshments and to make the money available to the National
Defence Fund.
To give a bue pretnre of the Unit, was would give something about
the darker side also. Even though the Institu~e authorities decided
to impart NCC training ~o all I & n B. Tech. students, the parade
a.ttendance was no~ very satisfactory. AB the choice of availing the
training facility soiely rested with the Cadet ,the avera.ge attenda.nce
continuously leU through a.bout 25% in spite of the national emergency.
Owing to the irregula.r nature of the attendance, the effectiveness of ~be
training wars reduced.
