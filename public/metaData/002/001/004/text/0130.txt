REPORT OP THE
ELECTRICAL ENGINEERING DEPARTMENT
The start of the a.oademic yea.r saw the Electrical Engineering
Department housed in its own quarters. A beginning was made by
occupation of the southern wing of the Electrical sciences block in
July 19()2.
The Depa.rtment, in the main, is being orga.nised with the
following divisions.

1. Electrical fundamentals and measurements
2. Electr.ical communication
S. Electrical Machines
4. Electrical power~

All the four divisions have been planned to provide effective instructionaL facilities for under graduate a.nd grauua.te students llla.joring in
Electrical Engineering.
Our la.boratory facilities are much better ana now pro"fide
practical work for our students majoring in Electrica.l Engineering.
In the course of time it is expected that we sha.U have a lot of
specia.l equipment.
The iunda.mentals and measurements section, will of course be
equipped with modern measuring devices. In a.ddition it will also
have special calibrating rooms where it will be possible to conduct
precision measurements. The Electrical Communication lab. is also
expected to have special equipment such as Pulse Oscilloscopes,
Envelope Dela.y and Distortion measuring devices. Our Electrical
ma.ohines section will be equipped with analog computers, Medium
frequency generators, Frequency response measuring unit, Magnetic
amplifiers and the like, while our Electrical power section includes
a High Voltage laboratory which will most certa.inly be one of the
biggest if not the biggest of its type in India. This also includes
an a.ir-conditioned chamber to help us conduct tests on equipment
under varied Glimatic conditions. This section also includes a relay
demonstration laboratory, switch gear testing laboratory and modern
rectifier technology laboratory.
In the ye&t under 1':eview We haive had ma.ny additions to our
staff. To all of them we edend a hearty welcome.
