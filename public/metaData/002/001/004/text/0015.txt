Presid€tlt of the Federal Republic of Germany

Dr. h. c. Heinrioh Luebke, second President of the Federal
Republic of Germany, was born on October 14, 1894 at Enkhausen,
a village situated in an idyllic valley of the" Sauerland" hills of
W estphalb.~ Here his parents ran a shoe-shop and a small farm
whel'e Heinrich Luebke used to wOl'k as a boy.
It was the intention of his brother Franz who, after their
father's early death, lookt:'d after the children, to give them a
better Education than the village school of Enkhausen could
possibly pl·ovide. Having taken additional tuition in Latin and
other subjects not taught in the elementary school, Heinrich
Luebke, therefore, first joined a high-school at Werl, and on
Easter 1913, he passed the Final Examination at the famous
grammar-school " Petrinum" at Brilon.
After completing one year's practical training, he enrolled as
,a student of agriculture, geodesy, economics and regional planning
at the Bonn School of Agriculture. With the beginning of World
War I in August 1914, however, he joined the army as a volunteer
serving in an artillery regiment. Towards the end of the war, he
was attached to the General Head Quarters as Lieutenant of the
reserve.
After the war, Heinrich Luebke resumed his studies at the
Universities of Mens~er and Berlin graduating in agriculture and
sU1'Veying in 1921.
His professional career was marked by his particular gift to
coordinate opposed interests. At first, his main interest was concentrated on the welfare of the small peasants, tenants and settlers of Westphalia whom he organized in 1922. Similar organizations developed in other provinces, and when these were united
in a "National Federation of Agricultural Small and Middle-Shied
Holdings ", Heinrich Luebke was elected its manager. Olosely
cooperating with the "Bauernbund" (Peasants' League), he, in
1926, brought about the amalgamation of thE'se two organizations
