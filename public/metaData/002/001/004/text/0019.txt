A place for everytHng and everything in its place" is an
oft repeated proverb. Having got exasperated times without
numbE'r, I tried to do something about it. It seemed the easiest
little thing in the world to hammer in a small nail in the wall
and hang a bunch of keys on it. But, alas! the next time I
looked there, not only did I find my keys mif;sing but I also lost a
nail in the bargain. So much for my futile attempts. I still
have keyless da.ys.

We have managed to dp so much about sending men up in
space and inventing all sorts of gadgets to lighten our load but
couldn't somebody find so)ne sort of thing called an automatic
key finder?
At I. I. T. the problem seems to have been solved partially
Most keys open most locks (since all of them are the same'make.)
However one of our boys has come up with a revolutionary new
idea. A friend tells me that no lock is invulnerable to a welldirected and well-placed kick at the proper angle from the toe
of an N. C. C. boot. T-his epoch-making discovery has lots of
potentialities but has only one snag. People would start losing
N. C. C. boots, then!
