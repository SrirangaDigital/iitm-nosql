This was just what Chiang was hoping for. Now he could
tell the mainland Chinese that the Communists had, after all,
fared much worse than what he did.
The only way for Mao to take the mind of the Chinese off
their economic difficulties was to confront them with much more
important problems. Here Mao was cunning anou gh to make
use of the nationalistic sentiments and aspirations of his people.
ffe raised the question of their national frontier with India.
He started this controversy to divert their minds away from
their internal problems.
Then came the 'ideological dispute with the Soviet Union.
China was just in the wake of a revolution, and the spirit of
obstinacy and rebellion was still boiling in her. She could not
conceive of anything-not even a nuclear war-that could
exterminate her 750 million people. She disagreed wholeheartedly with Khrushchev's policy of peaceflll co.-existence, and was
particularly sore at the fact that Russia was aiding the nonaligned countries at the cost of increased aid to China. So to
attack Khrushchev's policy-which she dared not do opehlyshe decided to attack a non-aligned nation in order to register
her protest. Which non-aligned nation? The previous four
factors combined with this new one made India the obvious
choice. And so it was a combination of these five factors that
led to the event which seemed so very incredi ble to the American
in Milwaukee, the Russian in the Moscow Cafeteria, and to
millions and millions of people all over the world-the invasion
of India by China.
