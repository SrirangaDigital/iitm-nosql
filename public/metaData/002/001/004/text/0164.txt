INDIAN INSTITUTE OF TECHNOLOGY, MADRAS

Second Term was the beginning of an exodus, when we migrated
to the Open-air Theatre. Here the shows were more enjoyable
due to better weather and operational facilities. We welcome the
German staff and theil' families and hope they will enjoy our
shows.
:, Our reports will not be complete without the mention of
Mr. Ramaswamy, who has been exceedingly helpful in the operation of the projectors.

Our thanks are also due to Prof. Narayanamurti, Venkateswarlu, Mr. Ebert for their help and guidance.

NARMADHA NOTES
July 8th 1962, What a day for the Freshers! On alTival at
the I. I. T. Campus we were confronted by a rather gloomy looking building, with no water, electricity, messing facilities and
well practically nothing that makes life in a hostel worth living.
The most awful prospect was of course the introduction that had
to be made with the seniors. All this is in the game of living in a
hostel I suppose. We enjoyed every bit of the fun and frolic and
wished for the day when we could be the pipers \ t
Soon after, all the prelimina.ry hardships, ca.me a period of
calm when we were at last able to ~ettle down to a spot of peace
in the hostel which by this time had been properly finished. The
elections to the Gymkhana Committee and Hostel Committees
came on in full swing. Prem Kalra started canvassing in an
impressive manner with all sorts of leaflets in true electioneering
style. Sirpal (the thin-moustache type!) got in by a close shave
indeed 1 In the Hostel Elections Jaideep won by a narrow
margin. Pretty ke~n this election fight.
