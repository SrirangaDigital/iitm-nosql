life who wore a grief-stricken face and tbe gentleman, with all
wealth in the world to command anything putting up a countenance, that would melt even a stone, were mysteries to me. What
could be their sorrow? I stopped thinking and witnessed a peculi~u·
Bcene in the next stop. A poor young man, with both legs gone,
perhaps by some accident, and who was struggling bard to walk
with the aid, got into the bus with great diffieulty and my (why
mine, everybody's heart) was full of sorrow spd sympathy for him
for such a fate so early in his life. How sorry would he be, if
even his very sight made others weep for him. But what's this
I ain seeing? His face gleams with brightness, his ugly teeth
flashing out. Do what I see is what I see ~ I could not conceive it again.
That rich man, who, could command anything is unhappy·
and this poor bare-cheflted fellow gay and all merry. That beautiful young woman who would convince anybody that persons in
history, who forewent great things for genuine beauty, did not do
so for nothing, was far from happy and this ugly creature hardly
able to creep on ground was all happy.
I began to think differently now. That rich man was not
satisfied, ~ ith what he had and hence unhappy. That beautiful
lady was not content with what she was or had and hence miserable. But that illfated fellowwas quite content with life, accepting
any calamity in the name of inevitable destiny and hence that
contentment or ha-ppiness rested in hiR heart.
As I said we want everything, we are not able to face disappointments, we are not content with what we have and the
result is simple, we are unhappy.
The famous words of Hilaire Belloc come to my mind.
" Happiness is not the necessary follow of wealth. It's contentment, that is happiness. Wealth does not necessarily lead to
happiness, nor poverty to pedantry." It has no bars, and it comes
tQ anybody, who is content. Be content always and be happy.
