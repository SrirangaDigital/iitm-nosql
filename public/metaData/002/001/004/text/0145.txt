F ACU LTY ASSOCIATION
The Fa.culty Association. founded in September 1960, ha.l eon
tinued to cater to the needs of the Aca.demic Sta.ff members in matters
relating to cultura.l a.nd social fields of human activity. Ma.n is ..
socia.l being and he desires to have socia.l contacts with his collea.gues
and f~l1ow workers after the da.y's work is over. In this direction,
the Association has taken a lead and has been arranging activities to
foster the fraternal feelings amongst the staff members, and we ha.ve
ha.d interesting programmes.
The activities for the current session commenced with a dinner
party given in honour or the visiting Directors of the other tbree
Institutes, a.t the New Woodland. Hotel, Mylapore. At tBe dinner
party. Brigadier Bose was 60 moved by the scenic beauty of the
surroundings, the cordial atmosphere and the genial company, that he
eomm.tted himself to entertain us to dinner whenever we choOBe to
visit hi. Institute. He ga.ve us some spicy jokes, which will linger in
our minds fol' along time to come.
Dr. Nicholos Klein showed us a.n interesting film-a. travelogue
of his country.
Mr. R M. Auty of the British Council ga.ve UI an interesting ta.lk
on the importance of humanities and social sciences in the engineerÂ·
ing curriculum. He also told us the differences in the systema of
education obtaining in Germany, England and the United States.
Professor Gerhard Rouve gave a talk on hit impressioDs of
Turkey, lupplemented by beautiful colour slides, through which he
had captured the acenic grandeur of tha.t country. His talk wa.s full
of interesting anecdotes.
We had the good fortune to have a.midst us distinguished scien'ists
from abroad, who were visiting Madral, in connection with the
International Symposium on Crystallography. I guess it was a
unique event in the history of the Association, since it is seldom
possible to get so many scientists at the same time.
We hope to have many mOre interesting programmes before the
session ends.
