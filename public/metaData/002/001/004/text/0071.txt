FOURTH ANNUAl.. NUMBER

59

In retrospect, I think I returned a full man; I was grateful
for 'C the feast of reason and flow of soul,'. Such experiences are
irreplaceable. "No man is an island," said John D nne in one
of his sermons, c. every man is a piece of the continent and part
of the mainland." Literature of the highest form is a personal
involvement in mankind and there's nothing like a constant
renewal of that involvement.

Twilight in the Campus
Umbra

Cuneiform
Securiform
Amorphous in silhouette
Shru bbery, underbrush and wood lot sway
Branch, twig and spray;
Orangeade oriflames simmer far west;
Fawns crest airy waves, foliage and fencf:'s,
Tube-lamps nazi-salute serpentine avenuf:'SUnwary traps for God's own little moths.
Inchoate
Incarnate
Truncated gu bematorial grounds,
Our chief's dream-campus sprawls
Somnolent, in-drawn, olympian.
Granolithic blocks, concrete cages and incunabula
Brighten up at hundred windov."s and hum. with life.
Gossip, gabble., cachinnation,
Pale bachelors, plump husbands,
Cackling womenfolk, giggling girls,
Silly maids and simpering servants.
