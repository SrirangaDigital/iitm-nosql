resources necessary for defence. More I. I. T.'s and more
engineers are required. More economic resources and 80 more
gold is required. More guns and hence more industrialisation is
required. Food problem and so more food output is necessary.
And to guide us with a determined will to resist evil and naked
aggressions, to raise our morale high during the present
national emergency, we require, Mr. Nehru and Kon-alignment.
