A Resolve
by

V. S. Kumar

The cannon roars and bullets fly t
Buzzing round the serene peaks,.
Shattering the magnificent calm,
That haloed India's heights.
Waking from their eerie dream,
The apostles of Panch Sheel rub their eyes,
To look aghast at their erstwhile friend,
Whose treachery base is 'Unsurpassed.
The mighty white majestic peaks,
Stand sentinel with frothing anger,
That blocks the enemy, to await,
The negligent gods to return to their posts.
The loyal sons tighten their belts.
To belt the foe a ringing lesson,
The pure face meanwhile blushes,
Tarnished with Chinese blood.
The truant gods come at last,
The mortal heil's wash her face,
To restore her to brilliant white,
And hoist the tricolour once again
