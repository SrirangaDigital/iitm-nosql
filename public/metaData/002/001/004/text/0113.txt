had a certain amount of matrimonial experience with one female
and such ex:perience has not been altogether of a satisfactory
character. But here's a man who has been so blind, so imbecile,
and so idiotic as to marry in ten years six horrrible scolds and
shrews. FOl' so doing, I class him as a natural fool; and even if

must have destroyed it. The plea of the Counsel for the defence
is sound in law and equity and I charge you to bring in a verdict

Thus Courts have been the arenas of many a witty combat.
The jests of the Justices, the laughs of the lawyers and the wits
of the witnesses that relieve the monotonous atmosphere of the
Court scene are spicy and saucy, piquant rod pungent. They
may not of course be comparable to the • quips and cranks and
wanton wiles, nods and becks and wreathed smiles of Milton"s
L' Allegro 01' Shakespeare's Porter in Macbeth or the Fool in King
Lear, who help relieve the tragedies by their flashes of wit and
shoots of humour. But all the same, the bonmot and the banter,
the jest and the jecose, the retort and the rejoinder, the sally and
the sortie exchanged in the courts are spontaneous and are never
pre-mediiated to bring humour for the sake of humour to get a
laugh with a guffaw, and any visitor to the Court is SUl'e to get a
feeling of jois de vivrs which he will long l'emE>mbet.
