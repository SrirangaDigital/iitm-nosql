FOURTH ANNU At. NUMBER

33

The e.ourtroom was packed, for the case had attracted c.onsiÂ·
dei'able attention from the local public. The prosecuting attorney
was Mr. Krishnan and Mr. Gupta had been retained for the
defence.
This is how the "Gazett~" reported it. .. It was a fine
morning and at preci~ly 10 a.m., the umpire came on to the
field; He pounded his gavel and asked the innings to commtlnce.
The prosecuting attorney went over the salient features of
the case. He said that the prosecution intended to show that
Mr. Sood had swindled the club of large sum of money and that
he had engineered a fake robbery to prevent disclosure." The
first few batsmen, namely Sharma Dutt and Inderjit were disposed
of quickly. Then the star batsman, Mr. Sood whose an'ival had
been long awaited came in to face the attack. The first few
balls from Krishnan were straight forward and he played them
with ease.
Is your name M. J. Hood?
Yes Sir.
You are the treasUl'er of the DYllamoes Cricket Clll b"
Yes Sirl

The next ball was a faster one and dead on the middle stump,
but Sood plf~.yed it with easy confidence.
"Did you or did you not embezzle the funds of"the Dynamoes
Cricket 01 ub ? "
" I certainly did not. The insinuation is preposterous? U
" Where were you at the time of the l"f"J,1bery?"
" In the Canteen."
The next delivery had a sting in it and almost had Sood in
in trouble.
"Did you not know that the Auditors were going to oheek
the boojs a week hence '? ..
Sen!tation 1
HI. , , I . . . I didn't know it."
