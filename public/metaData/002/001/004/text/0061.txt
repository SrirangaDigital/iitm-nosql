The absent minded ~ngineer
V. KotetJwaran

Mr. Lobo is an engineer. He had been a hard working and
intelligent student during his college days. But what made him
famous in his college was his inten'st in extra-curricular activities. An ambassador's visit to the college or the purchase of
dark coloured curtains for the hostels--both were the same as
far as he was concerned. He would be the first person to advise
and get things done and he was a member of all the associa.tions
and committees. A breezy individual, he faced his career with
the same vigour. Before long he was employed in a decent firm
for a still more decent salary and as usual became the centre of
attraction.
Years passed and Mr. Lobo did some higher studies and was
soon a recognised individual in all quarters. But still he held on
to his "extra-curricular activities ". To-day he has gone to
address a sugar and candy merchants' annual gathering. Why
not we listen to hjm? Here he goes.
.. Ladies and Gentlemen, it is a great pleasure for me to
address such a learned gathering of sugar merchants. It is un
necessary on my part to enumerate the important aspects of this
hydro-carbon which is manufactured from Cil! Hu 0 11 by the
process of fermentation. The strength of sugar solution is always
an interesting pl'oblem and very modern saccbarimeters have
used the principle of optical rotation ..â€¢ .,
-and so on and so forth. There was pin drop silence. The
audience consisted of nodding heads everywhere. Alas-the poor
Chairman was the only unfortunate one who could not afford to
sleep. He had to propose the vote of thanks. Naturally he
appreciated the engineering truths that were revealed during the
course of the speech (or sleep 1)
