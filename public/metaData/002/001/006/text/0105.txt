Educational Visits:
Visits to major industrial units in Madras were organised, for the
the fourth and fifth B. Tech. (Mechanical) students to appreciate
production processes in relation to their theoretical back-ground.
The co-operation of major industrial undertakings in Madras,
in organising the final year B. Tech. (Mechanical)-Production Engineering, Elective-Project work, was very encouraging and is gratefully
acknowledged.

Seminan:
Seminars were organised for the Staff and post-graduate students
regularly. The Staff also attended Seminars or special lectures, relating
to their fields, organised by the sister departments.
