would be pointless because those that have read them, require no
introduction, those who have not yet done so and intend to take the
plunge may want to form independent opinions (for nowhere is it truer
to quote 'One man's meat is another's poison' than in literary tastes);
and those who have an antipathy for either humour or fiction or both
will not read this!

The Shepherd's Call
P. Sudarsan

You blighters all, all of this flock;
Come near and crowd, the night is dark.
The twinkling slars, those dev'lish lampsLike blinkers, show the way of tramps.
Allow them not beloved fools,
Beguile thine eyes. "Tis me that rules "!
Stray not! Stray not! The pack is nigh!
The breeze mayhap betray your lie.
o Ye, that wander in this waste;
Turn back before the wolves make haste !
The twinkling stars, the hustling breeze,
The glowing moon, the rustling leaves,
Are nature's charms, praiseworthy deeds.
But lost is he, the one that heeds
The call of night, and eerie soundIn darkness shrill: The devil's hound',!
Nature's tresses, long and lovely,
Are black and sleek and slippery.
Her Day is dull, and not a maze.
The old ram knows: Green lies the graze.
Adorned witb blooms, her night to seek,
As true as hell, is death to keep!
