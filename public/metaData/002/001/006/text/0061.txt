The social worker was very much distressed to find the poor
knowledge of the boy with regard to important places and incidents
connected with our mother-country. He has so cleverly put questions,
all relating to Kathiawar or the modern Gujarat state or Sowrashtra
in th! hop~ of making the student reali'ie that the very. school
in which he i'i studying. is named after a state, which is so very well
known historically. He ex.horted the students to attempt to know all
about our country first and then know about the world at large.

[.!sum! his jO.lrney. The leddl!r stopped his ride and went into the hut
along with his friends and squatted on the clean mud-floor. The
peasant's joy knew no bounds thanks to the Leader's kind visit. Soon
he prepared some tea using a mud-pot and his only loin cloth as a
strainer. The leader's friends who were witnessing the preparation of
the lea, planned to give some excuse or other for not taking the drink.
