made, and we usually ended up in a hotel, pilling our bellies with ldlis
and swilling steamin~ coffee. Thus the days wore on, but 1 still could not
keep afloat, let alone swim and dive. Every time I tried to keep myself
above water, lover balanced and my feet would come down, groping
for the bottom.
Then, one fine morning, I resolved to take a chance. I looked
around meÂ· Everything seemed the same as ever, except for my
determination to swim this time. I walked up towards the deeper part
of the pool. I braced myself, and gave a look full of disdain, dignity
and resolve, which would have bowled my brother backwards had he
been facing me. Unfortunately, he was gazing wistfully at a girl going
through the motions of a perfect dive. My stout heart weakened as I
peered at the depths of the pool. My knees buckled, there was a
flutter in my stomach. I bent forward, then regretted my folly. But
then it was too late. I tumbled unceremoniously into the water with
a resounding splash. In thrashing around, I gulped down large quantities of water. I felt myself sinking like a stone. I shouted in terror
and my voice sounded strange in my ears. The second time I came up
I saw my brother wearing a horrified look. I went down again and
drank more water. Then I felt a hand around my waist and guide me to
the edge of the pool. "Oh, Anna" I cried out in remorse and relief.
But it was'nt my brother. It was a cross, beefy bulk of a man. My
brother still wore that look of a man Whose salmon has flipped out of
his dinner plate and has hit him between his eyes. The tough guy led
me to him with murder written all over his twisted face. He demanded
an explanation as to why my brother had not lifted a finger to save me.
My brother' found himself in a tight corner. Hesitatingly, and with
much hemming and hawing, he blurted out that he himself did not
know how to swim.
No more swimming for me, please!
