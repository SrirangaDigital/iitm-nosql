Such things are of common occurrence.
DEAD AS A DODO: Dodo is the name of a flightless forest dwelling bird, sometimes'larger than the size of a turkey. This bird and its
species is now extinct due to the unscrupulous hunting of the same for
purpos~ of food. This indiscriminate hunting of the bird was not
controlled and the result is that we don't have even one specimen of
that species. The Dodo has found a place in English phraseology. We
have a phrase in English "Dead as a Dodo", which means to say "dead
and gon~ without leaving behind any trace."
It is a matter of consolation that famous wild life experts have
advised Governments to build game sanctuaries for preserving the
denizens of the forest and the myriad forms of Girds and animals.
~rohibition of shoO,ting and Iicense~ gamehunting are fortunately in
vogue. WifJ life is one ofthe orders of the bewildering variety in the
Lord's creation-Nature in its "cruel beauty."

'BALANCE'OF NATURE: In Japan, once there was a mania
among the people for making money-purses out of serpent's skin. Lots
of snakes ~renunted, killed and their skins were dressed. This wholesale killings ·,of the snakes resulted in the increase in the number of rats,
which formed the main prey for the serpents and which ruined the corn
fields and other vegetations. The rat menace was there, when the
snakes were; not killed. Once we disturb any natural order, it ends in
some· sort of imbalance in Nature. We fell the giant trees in the forests
for-a variety of purposes but as a result of this the mosquitoes, which
are lodged nicely in· the bushy trees have to perforce leave the forests
and attack the cities. Thus deforestation has resulted in mosquito menace
in urban areas. So we find that every every act of the humans has got
its own repercussion in the general set-up. of things.
