shortly. In certain contexts, outworn cliches have sometimes a habit of
jumping to life, infusing with particular meaning the words they qualify.
When, therefore, we say that it is with a heavy heart we bid Sri
Natarajan farewell, finding solace in the thought that where we stand to
lose, somewhere, someplace, others ltand to gain-we express our
thoughts to a nicety.

The response to our call for contributions has been heartening,
particularly from the juniors. This has been positive not only in terms
of quantity but also in terms of quality. It is particularly gratifying to
note that a number of them are able to wield the pen with an elegance
that augurs well for the future. An Institute monthly is run precisely
as an outlet to their thoughts. Hitherto most of them have chosen to
blush unseen inside the confines of their room. Perhaps the future will
find them more favourably disposed.
And iinally we have to end on a note oi regret. The portrait
gallery of outgoing students, a feature introduced last year has to be
held over, as the response to our call for photographs has not been
adequate to justify their inclusion this year.
