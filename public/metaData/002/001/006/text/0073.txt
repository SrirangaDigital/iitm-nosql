Nature s Catechism on Life.

G. Sampath.
One summer's evening. The birds of the air had, out of sheer
exhaustion, just ceased their day long chirrup. There was a deep
silence for a while. Then, all of a sudden, the Sparrow tore the veil of
silence, chirping in philosopher~fashion, "What is life?"
The other birds were taken aback by this unexpected question.
The curiosity of most of them was piqued and there was a moment of
eager SU5pense when answer, was awaited for the poser. The Cuckoo
was the first to respond. She cooed in her most melodious, mellifluous
voice, "Life is Music."
Going into rapturei over the dark-blue clouds of the sky, the
Peacock, spreading his fan~like tail and splendid plumage, strutted a
jolly dance, as if to say, "Life is not only music, it is a merry dance as
well," Poor thing! It dared not reveal its cracked voice before the
sweet-throated Cuckoo.
An Earth Worm that had just laboured its way upto the surface.
panted out, "Life is a diligent effort made in the dark."
"Oh! No please, Life is a sweet blooming," so said the blooming
Rose Bud opening out its rosy lips. The half tipsy Bee which had just
kissed the full-blown rose and drunk deep of its honey, merrily.
hummed, "Life is an ecstasy:'
The Housefly wandering hither and thither moaned, "Why not say
life is a 'short day time and be done w,th it?"

An Ant paused in the ad of lugging along a grain of rice several
times its own weight, and cried out in anguish, "I do not see anything
but hard labour in Life."
The Laughing-Jack Dow, unable to say anything in the matter,
but designing to hide its own ignorance, indulged in a mock laugther.
This seeming insult might well have entailed the unleashing of a
rebellion had it not been for the timely intervension of the rain which
had just then sLarted coming d~wn in a heJ.vy d~jzzJe. The rain drops
fell like Natllre's own tears as if to show, "Life IS made up of tears."
