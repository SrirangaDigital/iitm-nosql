THE FILM CLUB
M. Menon

Of all the lI.T. Associations,
The Film Club is one which nobody shuns,
You could also a member be,
For a small sum of one rupee.
In one's mess bill this sum is found,
-Here to grumble the payer has no ground.
With great eagerness the students wait,
For isn't it less than the out~ide rate '1
Ah! At last its the long awaited Sunday evening,
The students are so gay that they almost sing,
-Into the open air theatre in twos and threes,
The students rush in like a swarm of bees,
At the stroke of eight the lights are off,
The silence is broken only with one or two coughs,
All eyes are glued to the portable screen,
On which a rectangular patch could be seen,
But alas! The patch is white in colour,
Whil.t happened to the picture all of us wonder,
Obviously there is no film in the projector,
A fault overlooked by our operator,
With a slight delay the mistake is rectified.
By which the annoyance or the audience is nullified,
If its a Western, the students are often tense,
As they watch the fights between the tough gents,
But if its a romance the audience begin to murmur,
For after all isn't everyone a potential lover?
Half way through there is no sound,
It will be some time till the fault is found,
Whistles and groans rent the air,
Perhaps this is more, than what they can bear?
To the projector the operator gives a kick,
Often this is effective to revive the flick,
If not the picture is usually postponed,
The operator is lucky if he is not stoned,
Finally with all the interruptions the picture ends,
People begin to say good night to all their friends,
Jom the film club to have some fun.
You always get it the way its run!
