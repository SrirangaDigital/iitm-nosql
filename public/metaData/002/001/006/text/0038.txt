car and crashed against the wall opposite. All this happened in a
fraction of a second, as aU accidents do. The natural concomitant was
of course, a minor injury.
The maxim that commonsense is for common people, and that we
should as engineers, assimilate more of esotoeric knowledge is worth
questioning. I suppose everyone should have commonsense as the
base on which any edfice of knowledge should be developed. Physical
immaturity, ris!c taking tendencies, tv quote the Safety Engineer, ,are the
few causes of accidents. The truth embodied in the statement that
learning from experience, particularly from others, is worthwhile as the
cost of such an experience may be too much or even priceless, as a
human life is.

"It is costly wisdom that is bought by experience"-Roger Ascham.

Indian Summer
Like giant burial stakes mourning a season',S del'l.th,
Yearning arms pleading heavenwards, starved
Trees sland alJ around brown and nude.
Dusty blue and breathless, the sky shimmers.
Gasping to carry the giddy heat,
Yawning furnace, kindled to the optimum.
Restless winds dance, whirling witches,
Showering eddies of duo;t, casting a spell.
Hot air expands as per Physics,
Life hides in silence, dumb with exhaustion
Until a lone bird pierces ihe stillness,
A frenzied cry, a tottering fight, plunk drawn to gravity.
Life wanders in a day dream, a watery dream.
Until distance lends not charm but ambrosis.
Every stope melting into flowing waler,
Tongues haMing, man and beast hasten towards Maya.
Mangoes, melons, and C3coanuts abet the dream.
Yellow. red, raw that hit the eye.
Nights hang heavy with sickly groans,
Sensuous hsmine perfuming the sweat,
Soft echose of dazed love and tossing sighs.
Darkness brings a sense of coolness,
While sizzling stars sparkle like fire-works.
A weeping child, rocking with sobs,
Subsides into sleep, happy oblivion.

(v. s.

KUMAR)
