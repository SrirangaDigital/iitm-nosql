Who Knows It?
M. Hariharan
The following puzzle, whieh owes its existence to its precursor,
"Who owns the Zebra?" (Reader's Digest, Dec. 1964), promises to
prove a veritable headache to even the most logical brain in LLT.,
Madras (Staff members not excluded). It concerns five students, each
from one or other of the five different Indian Institutes of Technology,
who have taken five different branches of Engineering. They are lodged
in different hostels during the Meet. Your problem is to find out which
of them speaks Assamese and which of them plays Basketball. The
following clues are presented as a medley of apparently unconnected
facts, as puzzling as a Cretan labyrinth. Answers are given elsewhere.
