to stop the bus on the way to issue tickets: they are a regular menace
and only aggravate the already exhausted conductor and the anxious
passengers. The ladies, of course deserve a special chapter. It will,
for now, suffice if I mention the tenacity' of th.e meal carriers, those
fragile looking women who balance on their heads out-size baskets
containing innumerable tiffin sets. The conductor and most of the
passengers always get wild with them but to no avail. J hated them
too, but now I defend them, for if they miss the bus I have to miss
my meal!
Pleasant or not give me a bus ride any time. I can now and then,
afford to miss the bus but never would I voluntarily miss the fun a city
bus provides.

Walking in the Rain
The initial fear over
Bracing like an athlete
Warming uP. breatlling deep
The sensuous perfume.
Lips pouting, catching
A stray dr(lp~ bright pearl
Peering through watery criss-cross
Soft, blurred shapes, blue-framed.
Shaking like a purring pup.
Cavorting through fast-filling puddles,
Wondering at the washed green foliage
Heavy and ripe like a pregnant woman.
Blind for a moment: the lightning.
The thunder, rattling. the bones.
Where are all the birds?
Hiding there and there and there
Poor things, so tiny and fragile;
Will that accommodatipg tree fall?
Good gracious., a motor car?
Curse you, all this mud spray:
Run for it, there is the coffee house
No there's the bus, work to do.

(v. S. KUMAR)
