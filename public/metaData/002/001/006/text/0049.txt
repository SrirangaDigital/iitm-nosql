A Shattered Hope
M.

VenkaJeswara Roo

On a mountaineering expedition I started,
Full of anticipated adventure and romance.
Risky though was the journey ahead,
Spirit of undaunledne~ was my guidance.
Five steep mountain slopes I had to cross,
With my own limbs as my kit and appliances.
Of valour and prowess I took recourse,
As I was a man with no personal alliances.
The glorious golden throne yon
With the promise of suzerainty
I long to reach in my ambition
And all hopeful certainty.
Amidst incidents of gloom and cheer,
Reached J the fifth and final stage
When hardships very severe
Came over to provoke my rage.
A tumultuous river had obstructed my way;
Not a canoe crossed my view.
A firm decision I took to swim away
So to lay my hands on the treasure 1 value.
Overwhelmed me surprise and deligbt,
When a damsel beautiful, as in a dream,
Offered a well-equipped boat and ber might
To succour me from the clutches of the stream.
The look so weird on the beauty
Upset my plans of futurity.
Closing my eyes like a boy naughty.
Set forth I on my swimming journey.
Amazement and consternation drove me wild,
When, unawares, a vortex great had sucked me in.
A whirl in my head and a swoon mild;
Numb were my limbs with repentance within.
Semi-conscious was I on the shore;
I was near the dtstination when realisation came.
Lo! There was not a throne of gold before,
Bdt a thorn-bestrewn chair of iron-frame!
