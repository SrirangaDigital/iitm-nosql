act, goaded him cn with their rhythmic handclapping ... "
needless to say, an account of the visitors' visit to Lords.

It was.

To the American, cricket is as mysterious as, strangely enough on
a reciprocal basis, the American football is to the Englishman, and in
fact to any man. Football, it is called no doubt, but few are really the
occasions on which the foot has anything to do with the ball. And
each bunch on the ground seems to be much more interested in the
person of their opposite numbers than anything else. What you would
condemn as the most damnable foul in football (as you know the game)
is termed a fair tackle in the American version. When you see a
number of players writhing on the ground, engaged in a free-for-all, as
it were, you may think they are fighting for the possession of the ball.
But sometimes you would prove eatirely wrong. for, this tackling is
indulged in, even when then the ball is nowhere in sight Dearby. The
reasons are of course best known to themselves.
Now. suppos~ the odds were even? Sounds a bit confusing, does it
not? What if one thousand betters put on an average of ten rupees on
a horse that wins at ten to one-and if the horse had dropped at the last
moment from ten to one to five to four? Or if you had ten to one on a
beauty that will start at odds on? But then, let the bookie tackle all this.
After all, he is the agent who passes on to the winner the money he has
taken from the loser. The emerald green of the turf, the prancing
thoroughbreds and the colourful jockeys are not all that make up this
kingly sport.
So you see, it is not easy even to come out well in comprehension
of a game, leave alone playin,& it!
