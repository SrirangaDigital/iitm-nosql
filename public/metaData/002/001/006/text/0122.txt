and their enthusiasm to make Literary activities within the campus
a success, leaves much to be desired. Are we not justified in expecting
you all to turn up in large numbers and act as morale-boosters to your
own teams, just by your presence? Is it unfair, to ask you to provide,
at least, an audience for the speakers who come from outside? It is our
hope that in the future we will receive greater support and thus be able
make our programmes more successful.
All that we have accomplished this year has been due to the
tireless efforts of so many behind-the-scenes people who are hardly ever
mentioned. I should like, therefore, to offer my grateful thanks to all
who have done much to make our efforts bear fruit. In particular my
grateful thanks are due to the Institute Gymkhana, and to Dr. Klein
without whose efforts and 'go' I wonder if we could have accomplished
half as much as we actually did. On behalf of the Literary Committee
I would also like to thank Shri R. Natarajan, Prof. R. Krishnamurti
and Prof. S. Sampath aT!d the Electrical Engineering Department for
all the help we have received from them.
Here's wishing to a bright future for our Institute in the field of
Literary Activities ill the post-Vaswani-Ananthu. Sid-era.
