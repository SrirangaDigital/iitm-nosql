SixTH ANNUAL NUMBER

39

During my spare time I tried to see as much of the Institute as
possible, and to this end the authorities seemed to have put up some
maps by the roadside.
First of all I tried to get my bearings to the library. In the thickly
wooded area where I ended up, backed by the assurance of the map,
I found not even the slightest trace of printed matter, though I looked
under every leaf. What surprised me even more was that I couldn't
find an Administrative Block to pay my first insta\me-nf of fees, though
the 'map' clearly indicated it. This time I was directed to a Building
Sciences block, which had no connection with fees as far as I could see.
Later on I decided to go for a swim. The lake, I presumed had
dried up, but there was no mistaking the huge swimming pool, all blue
and gleaming in the distance. So I set out, armed with towel and
trunks and though the terrain was rather rough, I consoled myself with
the prospect of lazing around in the pool. But luck wasn't with me
that day. The one feature in the Institute about which the map
seemed to be correct, was fenced in with barbed wire. There was even
a moat around it; a castle and draw bridge would have made the
setting classic.
I learnt- the truth about the 'swimming pool' only when I joined
up in July. If an} one had ventured to mention anything about
sewage disposal to me at the mterview, ] swear he would have suffcrep
a black eye. It was my fault. for not studying t~e map carefully
enough, but I finally lost all faith in it when I could not even find the
girls hostel.
My ideas about this ·place w~re, as YO'j can see, very confused. and
t!1ey still are to some extent but there is.l't anything more t. can say
without deviating from lhe subject of first impressions, so I wind up
with a very apt quotatlon fr0m a Bomb.lY guy at the Tnter I. I. T. Meet"This· is a v~ry stra:-tge place, w.th slatic rivers and moving mountains."
