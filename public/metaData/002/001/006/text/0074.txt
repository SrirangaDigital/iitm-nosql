When the rain ceased, the white-necked King-Eagle spreading wide
his broad wings and gliding in circles over-head, majl!stically and with
ease, issued a kingly proclamation, "All that you say is wrong. Life is
but liberty and power."

By this time dusk had set in. The practical Crow which indulged
not in fancies, entered its rest, built among the branchesf announcing to
the rest by its copious crowing, that it was time for bed. The rest
followed the Crow's example and retired to their self-made abodes The
leaves of the trees rustling in !he eady night's breeze appeared to saYf
"Life is a dream."
Midnight had sttuck. There was a heavy silence all around.
The I,J.Tian, extinguishing the midnight lamp in his study, sighedf
'-There is nothing else in life for me except books and periodicals."

1he profligate. retumin!! home after his midnight revels murmured
discontented by himself, "Life is one long insatiable desire."
tn the small- hours preceding dawn, the gentle cool Zaphyr
whistled, "Life is an ancient enigma."

The dawn gave birth to a faint reddish glow in the east which grew
moment by moment. Presently the tree..tops glittered with a golden
hue. The air was full of the music emanating from Nature's winged

minstrelsy, when the world Was aroused from its slumber and lethargy
by the radiant Dlorn ; it heard the inspiring voice of Nature proclaIming
to all creation:
"Life is a glorious beginning,"
