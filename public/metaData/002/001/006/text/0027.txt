SIXTH ANNUAL NUMBER.

In conclusion, it might be interesting to have a glance at
Churchill's own assessment of himself. The following are his words
written on the flyleaf of each volume of the history of "The Second
World War" : -

In war: resolution
In defeat: defiance
In victory: magnanimity

In peace: goodwill

Tn the first two he was hundred percent correct. In the last two
he was far from the truth. The division of Germany (in victory) and
the Foulton speech (in peace) will be some of the many instances in
which History, too, shall record its dissent.

Stroll by the Sea
Summer rush, parched throats,
Gasping breath, soft drinks, more thirst
Dragging feet, wind-blown sand,
Picnic debris, half-buried: scurrying Crabs.
Moist dank, bark drown like Chocolate,
Phalanx of waves pounding, breaking up
Cool spary, salty tang, deep breath.
Squealing children, galloping dogs,
Sand castles, tiny, stamping feet, outraged cry.
Calm again, vaccuum like, a private silence.
Beckoning waves, tossing catamarans:
The mighty and the brave; not paying
Invisible horizons drowned in sheet waters,
Silent lands whispering inaudible sounds.
Unending hush, a deep lullaby,
A sad chorus of the marine family?
Hawker's cries scattered by breeze,
Invoke strange thoughts; misty?
Darkening sky: a painters dream.
Throbbing lamps, thinning retreating crowds,
Onrushing waves, white spray sparkling
Smell of fish, visions of food, a sigh
