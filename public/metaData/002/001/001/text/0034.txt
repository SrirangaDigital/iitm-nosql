SPORTS REPORT
We had to commence this inaugural year
of the Indian InstItute of Technology without
the service of a PhysIcal Dlrector. ThIs
imposed several handicaps m the orgalllsation
of sports and games activities. These were
overcome to a certain extent by the appointment, at the beginnIng of the year, of captams
for organising various games in the hostels.
This idea worked well and throughout the
year games were organised by the captains very
satisfactoril y.
In the second term it was decided to hold
our Athelettc Meet. A Sports Committee with
Sn P. S. SnOlvasan as the organlser was set
up for the purpose. We were able to obtain the
Teachers' Trammg CoHege Grounds and also
secured the services of the OdLlals from the
Teachers' Training College, YMCA College
and other Colleges.
The Meet was held on 21-2-60 with heates
on the afternoon of 20-2-60 and forenoon
of 21-2-60. Keen enthusiasm was evinced
by a large number of students and the Meet was
a general success. Prof. B. Sen Gupto, DIrector
of the InstItute took the salute at the march

past of the competitors.
Jocob Dominic
emerged on the ChampIOn Athletic of the Meet.
I take thIS opportuOlty to express our
thanks to the Teachers Trainmg College for
the facilItIes they extended, to all the officials
especially Mr. Ramachandran of Iha Besant
School for his untinng effrots and help and to
Dr. Venka+eswarlu, Mr. S Padmanaban and
Mr. P. S. SrtnIvasan of our Staff for their
services in makmg the Meet a success I also
thank MIS. Uberol & Co. for theIr kmd gesture
in donating a champIOn cup for the Athletic
meet. Tournaments were held m varIOUS games
though the absence of our own grounds was
keenly felt. These games brought to hlght the
talent avaIlable amongst us atOund whIle the
future teams are ')ure to be b1l1It up. The list
of wmners 10 varIOus events IS pubhshed

ECONOMY OF VIA-MEDrA (MIXED ECONOMY) AN ADVOCACY
A.

v.

RAJAGOPALAN, M. A.

At the prevailing economic and political
conditions, it is obviou'l that it is not possible
for countries to follow either the 'LaIssez
faire' capitalism or the 'classless society' of
communIsm.
In the world of today, uncontrolled capitalism is an unrealistic propOSItion, so too, a
completely state-controlled communist economy
cannot have long-run stabilIty. Even the
staunch exponents of the respective economic
philosophIes, are tOday forced to be flexible
and adobt a certain amount of latitude.
The advent of political freedom to most of
the under-devloped countries has warranted the
OrIgination and applicatIOn of 'mixed economic
pol icy' which can be defined as an economic,
policy which lends ample scope for operation
of both the private and pubtic sector ThlS
mixed economy is an off-spnng, of capital1sm
and communism. The pecuhar feature of this
Thirtytwo

is that it tries to keep intact the merits of a
capltahst economy, the praisewerthy ends of
a SOCialIst SOCiety. ThiS pattern of economic
pohcy faCIlItates increased ploductlOn and
eqUItable dIstnbutlOn ~llld promotIOn of heavy
mdustnes and publtc utIlity undertakIngs.
An example of a country that IS following
the mixed economy pattern, IS Indta. The
IndustrIal Pohcy Resolution of 1956, clearly
brmgs out the Idea of co-operatIOn of the
prIvate and pubhc sector as imperative for
qUick econmic advancement of the country.
For IndIa, no other SOCIO economIC policy
seems to be saner or more ratlQnal than present
one of ' hve and let live.'
The applicatIOn of the co-existence principle
of private and publIc sector 111 the economic
sphere would Yled good returns, in the shape of
expeditIOUS economIC progress 'parrl passu'
with social justIce.
