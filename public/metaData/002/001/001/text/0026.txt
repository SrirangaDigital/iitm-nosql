CAN YOU TELL?
P. C. Gupta.

"Where can a man buy a cap for his knee?
A key for a lock of his hair ?
Can his eyes be called an Academy,
Because there are pupils these?
What jewels are there to crown his head?
Who crosses the bridge of his nose?
Can he use, when repairing this bridge of his
nose,
The nails at the ends of his toes?
Can he ever faU on a slip of his tongue?
Does he play on drums of his ears?
And how does he sharpen bis shoulder blades?
To answer all this would take years

THE SEVEN SINS.
Knowledge without character
Business without morality

Twenty four

Science without humanity
Worship without· sacrifice
Pleasure without conscience
Politics without principle
Wealth without work.
INTELLIGENCE........ CONTENTMENT
Inte1ligence is what you get from home.
Common sense you must develop yourself.
Learning is what you get in school. Knowledge
is what the world hands you. Judgement
comes only with years. Experience is a bitter
medicine administered by life itself and must
be taken with a bit of conscience. Wisdom is
a phantom often chased but seldom overtaken, Success or failure are matters of
opinion. Reputation is the golden scale. Contentment is the final objective.
