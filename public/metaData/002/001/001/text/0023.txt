Thanks to the Ministry of Scientific Research
and Cultural AlI airs, Government of India,
tl!e then Educational Offi~er too, true to the
dictum that the library is an integral part of
an educational institution, ordered books to
the value of Rs. 80,000/- in March 1959 itself,
that is, two months before our Institute started
functioning. Thus it was that even froUl the
beginning, books are readily available to the
teachers and students of the Institute for con..
sultation and loan. There are nOw about
4,000 books got by purchase and 1,000 books
got as gift from West Germany. It is hoped
to classify and catalogue them on modern
lines before the beginning of the second year.
About 200 periodicals in Mathematics, Physics,
Chemistry and Chemlcal Engineenng are current. There is also a good collection of reference books like encyclopedias, dictionaries,
