THE FIRST FIVE-YEAR PLAN
V. S. KUMAR

Oh I plan of humble ambition, amply realised
Creator of hope, how did it so happen,
Yourself a creator, your life was but short-lived '1
And yet have you survived in your sturdy off-spring.
Empty you're not, for you have stirred
People's passion and left them your promising child,
For them to foster and see your image.
Weep not then over people's rejoicing,
For to mortals common are birth and death
And their hope is as enormous as the solid impression
You have left behind and as much liquid tears
As the ink in you, the hope can blot.
Pardon them, Oh humble parent plan!
And join everyone in your heir's crowning
And be satisfied, people gratefully worship
Your child, whom they think yourself new l

SUMMER
O. VISWANATHAN
The earth is a stiDy throat of parch~d silence,
The sky is a vast kitchen of burning oven;
The river is a static bed of waterless pathos;
The tree is a standing agony of silent heigbt;
The dry chirp of thirsty birds,
Breaks the hot dumbness of the fainting noon.
The mire-sick buffalo is lowing for puddles,
The sun-burnt bricks are in a sweaty swoon,
The south summers in sweltering

sun.

Solar ardour steals into the world
Wbich is an \lftcndiq thermal throb.
