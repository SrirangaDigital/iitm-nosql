THE ROAD TO I. I. T.
V. S.

KUMAa

Come to our I. I. T.,
For monkeys, deer, men and gaiety

It's broad, it's long,
With snakey roads and sbady throng.
Dangerous bends an' deep pits

It's safe on way to keep

yOUt

wits.

Lofty trees and rustic looks,
Sleek avenues and suspicious nooks.
Primitive carts and posh cars,

All at gate the Watchman bars.
Panting workers and puffing bosses
Mostly profits, make no losses.
Ruined temple and roarinB machine;
Musty oldness and modern sbeen;

Stygian darkness and blazing lights,
Civilized, but full of frights.
Grazing grounds and eating places,
Beast or man busily paces
Old or new, all is one;

If you're lost you are done.
Old jungles and modern houses,
See for yourself what it rouses
Said a visitor "God Almighty,
Too much, the road to 1. I. T."
