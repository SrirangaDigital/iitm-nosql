THIRD A.NNUAL NUMBER

Now our Engineer had associated himself for the past five years
with a considerable quantity of stones, mud, soil and the like, so that one
might expect him to have become as inert as the earthly substances mentioned
before. But, no! His heart was still in a rather elasto-plastic state and was
easily moved by the sight of tears. Economics and Physics had not done
their worst, yet.
He consoled her as well as his unpolished eloquence would permit
him. "Please don't cry, fairy dear, I'll fetch your wand at all costs, even
if it should warrant a couple of "D" grades in the coming Periodical
Examinations" .
He slung his slide rule over his shoulder and with a resolute N.C.C. gait
marched in the direction of the Institute's Laboratories.
Curse the attender. on this day of all days he had to be late!
The Engineer stood at the locked doors of the laboratory and ran
through the plans be had formed. That he should go in quest of the wand
was out of the question, for, he was not a detective, but, an Engineer.
Well, then, the only other solution was to replace the wand with another
wand. And, who, but he, the Prince of Civil Engineers should be better
suited for a job demanding such ,delicacy and precision!

Ab, there's the attenoer, 1bat tardy fool. Hurry up, witt yO\) I
