INDIAN INSTITUTE OF TECHNOLOGY, MADlUS

Officially lawaharIa! Nehru is not only our Prime Minister, but the
Foreign Minister, and Minister for Atomic Energy as well. Unofficially
he is India's Chief planner, chief policy-maker, and chief reformer. Proud
of his command of English Nehru will sign no letter prepared by anyone
else. and he personally dictates the great bulk of cables going to Indian
ambassadors abroad. Nehru starts off each day at New Delhi at 6.15 in the
morning with twenty minutes of yoga excercise that invariably include a few
head-stands. By 1.15 he is in his teak-lined study reading cables from his
Ambassadors and signing correspondence that he dictated the night before.
Promptly at 8.30 after three minutes breakfast, Nehru moves into the carpeted
room of his residence. Here awaiting his arrival, there is always an assemblage of labourers, refugees, petitioners and peasants, some of whom have
come to Delhi from as far as two hundred miles away to state their grievances to Nehru personally. The Prime Minister talks to them, and often dictates on the spot a letter to the appropriate official.
Thus because of all this bardwork under Nehru, India has had a generally sound Government, stable currency, a worthy democracy, throughout
its years of independence. The press is free, the restrictions on free speech and
assembly are minimum. Forty million of us attend schools and colleges, and
the number is to be doubled in the nex.t four years. The community Project
and National Extension Services are also doing excellent work in the rural
areas under his guidance. If anyone can claim the credit, it is Nehru, and all
of us know it. May Nehruji live long for a speedy industrialization and
economic and social independence of this great nation.
