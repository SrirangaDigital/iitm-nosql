obtain for the small consideration or six rupees a piece, our marIes of distinction which elevated us above the commoners, who neither read nor spoke of
cricket, and what is more, had not been to the test-match. We did not even
mind the patronising airs of the man at the counter, resembling rather those
of a head-master supervising the distribution of sweets to school-children on
R.epublic Day, and we were delighted at our "sweets".
Alarm clocks have a disgusting tendency of not going off when most
needed and mine is no exception. Generally this does not affect me as I
sleep very little on occasions such as this, when something. so exciting and
important as a cricket Test, is in the offing. This time, however, I went into
a deep sleep just before I was due to get up. I dreamt I was a Test Player
just completing the fastest century in history, in a matter of some ten hours.

When I bolted out of my flat into the darkness outside the very atmosphere reeked of cricket, though it did even more of buffaloes and cows. The
whole world seemed to be moving towards the bus terminus; who could
rely on a mere bus-stop on &uch a day?
Fortunately for me, M had already arrived and was well up in the
queue. And as a clean shirt in India is even today an effective substitute
