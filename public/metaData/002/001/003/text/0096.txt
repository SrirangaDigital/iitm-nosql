TECH-OUT
(I. I. T's Outdoor Club)

The Club was formed on October 6, 1961 and enthusiasts were not
slacking.

It remains for more staff members to interest themselves in our

activities, which include, hiking, swimming, rock-climbing, boating, etc.

Our first outing was to the Rock Quarry near PaUavaram Railway
Station on a rock-climbing expedition. We met

at

the rocks at around

8 A.M. and practised a few belays and rappels. A good time was had by an.
After a fruga11uncb of bread, butter, cheese, hard boiled eggs, more cheese,
more bread and butter, sausages and tea we came home tired but happy.

OUt

second outing was to Elliott's Beach for a swim. Men being men

being men we thought perhaps that we would see some women being women
on the beach a fa the Riviera. We saw one, a pregnant shark, dead to !loot,
being dragged along the sand. She was a beauty.

After a good swim in a

good sea we came home. If all our outings are as good as the mst two, our
club should have a great future.

lfs upto our present Outers to set the

traditions for U.T. for all time to come!
