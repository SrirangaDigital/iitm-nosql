INDIAN INSTITUTE OF TECHNOLOGY, MADRAS

East and the West, from the North and the South and from the central heart
of India. It is tbis polyglot composition that has lent a richness and variety
to the corporate life in the hostels.
It bas almost become an epigram to say that this is the age of techno-

logy. Many have expressed the fear that our aesthetic emotions are in
danger of getting dried up before the gaint strides that Technology' is making
today. We do not apprehend such danger alall. Our students and the staff
have not lost their sense of wonder. They still have time to stand and
stare. Their rich and lively fancy, their sease of humour. their virile
minds ~ all these can be s.een in the various articles published here.
We can confidently say that in the pUrsuit of prosperity through technology, we shall not lose sight of tbe higber values of life. • Life has a
meaning', we feel with Browning·" to find its meaning is my meat and
drink ".
