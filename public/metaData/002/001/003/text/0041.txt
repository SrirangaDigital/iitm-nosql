The papers forecast,
The sages broadcast
That the end Was well-nigh \
We would all only sigh!
That eight planets would meet
To give mother earth a treat,
That the earth would quake
And we would shake.
That the seas would soar
With a murderous, roar,
That the Fifth of Feb'ry
Would all mankind bury.
The pious became mor~ PIOUS,
The impious slightly pious;
Wives were more affectionate,
And husbands doubly' passionate;
With many a nervous kiss
Before all that was to be bliss.
Business began to sag
Under the planetary drag,
Schools were locked
And temples flocked,
. Election fever and planetary fever
Made our campaigners all shiver.
The fatal day came
We were in classes all the same,
The march to the coffin,
Was to be soon in the offin',
And men waited with anxiety
The approaching calamity
But, 10 and behold!
The morrow was on the threshold r
And so with souls morc bent
To work, men went.
