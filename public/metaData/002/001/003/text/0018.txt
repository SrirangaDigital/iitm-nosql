There it stands.
A simple corrugated shed
That gives us our daily bread,
A happy haven for spirits free
Fleeing from walled monotony.

That never does our hunger rouse!
A den of truants to keep their tryst
To puff iB peace and quench their thirst;

Coffee that only wets your lip.
We pine in vain for a stimulant cup,
But drink in truth a bilious cup.
Tea is always flavour free,
But brewed in sylvan secrecy.
Breakfast sure is gastric anguish,
But most of us pretend relish;
Lunch is sultry noon's travail
Which aching bellies often wail,
Hunger is the best sauce,
Lucky caterer knows no loss;
Take no offence gentle feeder,
Hungry mouths always blabber.
Pardon this our dyspeptic thought
We have learnt to beat our lot.
