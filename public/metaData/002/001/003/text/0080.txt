INSTITUTE GYMKHANA

'What is this Institute Gymkhana l' is the question which a distinguished
Professor from a leading college in Madras asked. On looking up the
dictionary, one would find that Gymkhana is a public place arranged for
display of athletics.'
As this meaning of 'Gymkhana' does not fi t into the pattern of Gymkhana
activities in our Institute, you may look up Encyclopedia Britannica for
further information wherein you find "gym1chana" is a display of athletics
and equestrian events originated at the military stations of India. The word
apparently is derived from Hindusthani gendkhana, "ball house" or
"racquet court" and the Persian khana, "house" ...... 00tside India, amusing
races were added. Thus gymkhanas now include varied competitions, some
serious and some funny, on foot, on horseback and on bycycles ......
SCOPE OF ACTIVITIES

At the Indian Institutes of Technology, Gymkbanas are intended to
serve as organisations for fostering and developing extra-curricular activities
of the students."
The question then atises, 'What are ex.tra-curricular activities l' This is
again a difficult question to answer precisely. But a fairly satisfactory definition of extra-curricular activities is "programmes and events carrying no
academic credit, sponsored and organised by pupils' or students' organisation
or by the educational institutions, designed to entertain, instruct and or
provide exercise of interest and abilities, subject to some measure of control
by the institution."
The purpose of the extra-curricular activities of the gymkhana may be
more clearly defined as
bringing together students and teachers of different faculties, dis ..
ciplines, interests 'and age groups for mutual benefit,
providing facilities for the development of individual talents in a wide
variety of activities, developing the qualities necessary for working
with others as a team,
developing qualities ofleadership and a sense of respect and tolerance
for the opinion of others.
