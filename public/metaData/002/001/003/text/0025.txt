THIRD ANNUAL NUMBER.

Not be able to hear it.
Something,
That I have heard,
Often
Admired, loved and adored,
Always.
That is why
The music.
Makes me sad
And makes my heart pine.
For what is not mine,
So,
Away from this music.
And the memories it brings,
Let me look
For calmness
Solitude,
And silence.
