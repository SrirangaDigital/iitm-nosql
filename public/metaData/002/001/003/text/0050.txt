Nothing ever happened to Pipsqueak, the quiet fellow who sat at
the back of the Humanities lecture room. The Professor droned on mercilessly, Pipsqueak decided that it was getting boring and he finally began
concentrating on a mosquito which was buzzing around his desk. The
mosquito travelled in a wider are and suddenly it--it just wasn't there!
It disappeared I Pisqueak thrust his left hand towards the place where the
insect had vanished.
"Is there anything the matter, Mr. Pipsqueak? You raised your hand",
"No, professor, I didn't raise my--yes I--N-no, nothing,
Sir".
It was then that Pipsqueak (Squeak for short) looked at his left hand.
He blinked. He pinched himself. He decided he was wide awake and what
he saw made him wince. HE WAS MISSING THE FINGERS OF HIS
LEFT HAND. He did not FEEL that his fingers were missing. He could
even wiggle them. But yet he could not SEE them.
He took his pencil (Venus HB) and held it out with his right hand so
that half the pencil disappeared. Then he brought it down sharply and
heard a sound identical to the one made by a pencil rapping the knuckles of
a person's hand. Those were HIS knuckles. He knew that. A mild panic
seized him. When the professor's back was turned towards him, he got up
and took a step towards the space". Suddenly everything became black
and he lost all the self-confidence that the N.C.C. had taught him. He
heard a soft whirring of motors all around him and yet his knees would not
listen to reason--they refused to support his bulk and he sank down
slowly.
A shrill metallic voice, which seemed to envelope him. demanded
"Wacha doin' 'ere?" Slowly Squeak came to "Savdhan" and asked. softly•
.. Where am 11" .. 'Dmy timachine" came the reply.

"Uh?"
