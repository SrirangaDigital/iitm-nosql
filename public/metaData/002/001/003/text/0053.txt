RAo

The intensity of the intent wish
To learn the mysterious U Deutsch ",
Instigated by its propinquity with English,
Is interred under an insipid anguish
When we stepped into itsÂ· grammar so outlandish.
It is a mountain, you may think unaware
For "Alp". beware that is a "nightmare " !
Be the possessor of a " paddock" with German .. AnBer "
Don't hold any" rank", it is "slender";
Scold one ,. Robber" , and apologise with .. rubber".
Thank none in German with "Danke",
He may slap you thinking you scold bim "Donkey".
You are losing a .. fairy" by paying a "fee",
You may hate a .. Rat", it is their .. remedy".
Don't try a "Jeer", it is "empty".
Don't give or take a .. gift tt. it is ,. poison" vicious;
You are an owner of "scythe" if you have .. sense" .
AD "red" things appear "rot" to German eyes
c. Links" - you may think is your "golf-course",
It is (to) their" left ", and their" golf" is "gulf" of course
Don't make .. sound", it is their U HaD".
You may call it "bright", but they call it "Hell"
They look upon "hat" as .. Hut" and " boat" as "Boot U
They call (you) "mad" if you mean "tax" by "toll"
You won't wear a "rock", but they say their " Rock" is your U Coat U
Our German Teacher indeed is our boon;
His name is "short"; but he is not a buffoon;
He is a versed linguist and a gallivant raccoon;
Teaches German in all the languages known,
And punishes us with his dummy pistol or a counter-feited swoon.
At the delicious German banquet, he is the host;
Feeds us with icicled cakes of jokes and bonbons sweetest,
With ftavoury juices and dessert of savoury taste,
And our voracious minds reach satiety at an cost.
Ma, I invite you to Qne such a feast for a toast!
