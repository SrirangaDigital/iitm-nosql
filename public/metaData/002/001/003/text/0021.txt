THIRD ANNUAL NUMBER

I had always found it difficult to answer questions on Integral Calculus,
but never so much as I did to answer this one on Integral Congo.
And so the Director went to the next question, "Who according to
the U.N. Commission Report, murdered Prime Minister Patrice Lumumba."
I blinked. All I knew was that the person who had murdered him
also murdered my hopes of getting a job as Assistant Engineer.
"You may go," said the Director which of course meant that I may
never again come. That was the end of the interview-and of all my hopes
of getting the job.
I didn't have the heart to take a taxi, and so boarded a bus. I saw a
man reading a newspaper, on which was printed ill boJd letters, "National
Reconciliation in the Congo.' Congo crisis comes to aa end".
Why couldn't these Congolese have reconciled a few days back, thus
saving me the job as Assistant Engineer? As this thought ran into my mind~
the Couductor asked, "Ticket, please."
I replied absent-mindedly, "one ticket to the Congo",
The whole bus burst into laughter.
"Must be a politician deeply interested in the Congo crisis", I heard a
passenger remark.
How could I explain to him that it was due to ianorance of Congolese
affairs that I had lost my job as Assistant Engineer?
And now, just as Dr. O'Brien is jobless, so am I, and all thanks to the
Congo. I tell YOll, Damn the Congo 1
