THIRD ANNUAL NUMBER

47

The police decided that the fault was that of my friend who jumped on
the traffic lights and not that of the American who crashed against us. This
did not dishearten our old timers because it was now only the question of
my friends insurance company paying us compensation and not that of the
American's. Lo and behold! my friend had not insured his car against
such risks! He is a greater philosopher than we Indians ordinarily are.
He never cared for his life nor for the lives of others I!! However, he had to
shell out Rs. 4,000 for the American and we did not want to tax him further
by claiming compensation. Anyway to state the moral of this story in the
traditional way: ascertain before driving with an Indian in the U.S.A.
whether or not he has insured bis car. IT you are lucky as we were you: will
get atIeast your life though not money; if not you will get neither.
