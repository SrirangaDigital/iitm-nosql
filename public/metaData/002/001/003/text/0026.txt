Rock Climbing is a pre-requisite for mountain climbing. It can also be
a good week-end activity for people far removed from high mountains. It
develops bodily coordination and provides enough challenges of the 'Man
against Nature' type to set it apart from milder activities such as Cricket,
Hockey. etc. It is neither more dangerous nor more difficult to learn than
other skills such as swimmina. 'Rock Acrobats' come in all sizes, sexes and
ages.
Learners of rock climbing need very little by way of personal equipment.
The oldest pair of thick cotton slacks that one has and a good pair of tennis
shoes are essential; the nature of the beast is such that saris are taboo.
Optional, but advisable are a pair of wicket-keeper's inner gloves.
Let's say then that we have the fonowing:
(1) A few novitiate climbers: A, D, C........ .
(2) A rocky area with a few simple climbs.
(3) Someone who knows something about climbing (X)
(4) A good climbing rope (Nylon-1/16") of about 30 metres
length.
The first thing we learn is to tie the bow-line, the most commonly used
knot in rock-climbing. (Figure 1) Take one free-end of the rope and pass it
around the body after just making a loop in front. Then do as shown. The
knot should neither be too tight nor too loose but just comfortably around
the body. For those who find themselves on the rocks without figure 1, there
is a memory-aid which runs as follows:
The rabbit (free-end) comes out of the hole (the loop), runs around the
tree (the rest of the rope), and back into the hole (the loop).
For those with a poor memory and without figure 1, prior practice is
advised; however it is quite easy to learn.
Once the bow-line is mastered the next thing is to know how to belay
(Figure 2). Belaying is the art of holding a climber on the rock face so that
