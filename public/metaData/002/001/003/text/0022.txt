Music.
Fast and slow,
Ringing and vibrating.
Notes, high and low,
0, this one of Muses Nine,
Makes my heart sad, and pille
For,
What I have DOt.
It reminds me,
OF past, dead and cold,
OF a voice,
That is no more,
Mine.
It scars my imagination.
With remembrances,
Sad and bitter.
Takes me,
Back to a being,
That is,
And yet is no more,
For it is not mine.
Gives me a sense,
OF finite 11eyond indefinite,
OR is it,
The Infinite within the finite.
To know, that,
There, far away,
In the lap of mountains,
Rises ever a VOICE
OF which aU this music,
Js but a faint representation,
And yet,

Prize winning contribution.
