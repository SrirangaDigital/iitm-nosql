not least, is the peculiar position of the inability of the Members to resign
until the Parliament comes to an end. In U.S.A. it is sufficient that if a
Member wants to resign, he can do so by giving his resignation letter to the
Speaker. But in Britain, it is not so as the act of the year 1623 says so.
Then what is the escape from this rule. The rule that no Member can
accept a job of an office of profit in the gift of the crown serves as the remedy
to this. The Member who wants to resign would get the consent of the
Speaker for appointment to the post of Stewardship of Chiltem Hundreds, a
post having no salary but nevertheless a gift of the Crown, whereupon his seat
as a member would be vacated.
The above afe only a few examples. It is characteristic of the British to
follow tradition rigidly. The House enjoys its old customs and that is the
way to preserve them.
