" What a piece of work is a man I

How express and admirable!
In action how like an angel!

this will be independent of height, latitude and longitude, etc. (independent
also of the experiments used to measure it and also the experimenters).

nights are longer than the days by four hours; 16:8, the total time remaining
the same. Man can sleep more and study less; he can drefm more and

Space shall contain only four things; the Sun, tbe moon, the earth and

useful. Some trees will be straight with branches going at angles of 90°, 60°,
45° and some trees will form a circle. some ellipses and some hyperboli with
