facilities. Efforts are being made to organise as many sports activities as
possible. A stadium for conducting sports Meets, a gymnasium for conducting gymnastic activities, a big common hall for conducting indoor competitions are the immediate needs of the gymkhana. Facilities for rowing
and swimming will also be needed as the membership of the gymkhana
increases.
SHANTl KUNI

A quiet place in the campus with a kunj or grove of trees with a huge
tree in the centre providing the necessary shade where peace or shant; prevails
has been found by Professor Sengupto. It is named Shanti Kunj developed
and handed over to the gymkhana for its meetings. It is hoped that Shanti
Kunj will be developed further, perhaps by providing permanent lighting
arrangements, access roads, parking space, concrete benches, rooms fot
storage of furniture and microphones, etc.
Shanti Kunj cannot, however, be used all throgh the year as rains in:
Madras do not seem to obey the predictions of meteorologists. It is necessary
to have an Auditorium if we wish to spread our literary activities throughout
the year and if we wish to organise inter-collegiate literary competitions. It
will be useful to have the Auditorium, Gymnasium and Gymkhana Office in
the building.
PUBLICATIONS

The publications of the gymkhana this year are this 'Third Annual
Number' and brochures for the Sports Day on March 3, 1962 and for the
lnstitute Day on March 9, 1962.
The members of the Literary Activities and Magazine Publications Committees feel that it will be possible to run from next academic year a Monthly
or weekly, devoted principally to campus events and news of interest and
value (0 the students.

following members:
1. Dr. M. V. C. Sastry for GroupDiscussion.
