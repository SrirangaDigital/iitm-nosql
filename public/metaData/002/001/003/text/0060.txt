* THE

AROMATIC RIVER
I.. T.

NAllAYANAN

Fringing the Central Station,
At nobody's invitation,
A river takes a winding courseIt is the Cooum-of course.
It is spanned
By a bridge ill·plannecl,
Which is memorable
For reasons innumerable.
Foul and fragrant
With a special brand or squalor,
Seemingly stagnant
With spontaneous change of colour :
So flows the river
The City's big sewer,
Bubbling oxides and sulphides
Difficult to analyse.
The author of nausea
The peril of the trachea:
So the river flows
With lots of mosquitoes ;
Sow, pig and swine
And their long family line
Dip here for fun
In the bright noonday sun.
The permanent haunt of beggars
And fast-talking hawkers
The bridge also boasts of sharpers.
Who relieve the purse of others;
And so I say

That it causes dismay
To all. who may

Have to pass this way.
