LEARNING

TO

DRIVE

~~---------~-------

learnt to drive one sunny morn,
When I entered the car and pressed the horn,
With deadly determination I decide~ to drive,
Trying to ignore my broth~r's jibes.

I

settled myself and pressed the key,
A cough, a splutter and my brother's, 'Hee-hee!'
Turning away I released the clutch,
A cranky rattling was the result.
I

For hours it seemed I tinkered about,
While my brothers doubled, as tho' from gout.
Finally, after grave thought I said,
,
'Its no use, the battery's dead.'
His laughter stopped as tho~gh chopped off,
His rage increased as the car gave a cough.
tIt's not my fault,' I cried,
'You bumbling idiot!' he replied.
'What you know,' he continued in rage,
'About cars, couldn't fill a page,
Wait till Bad sees the battery,
You'll wis~ you were in the artillery.'
Quaking with fear, I tried again,
Tho' I was sure, it was in vain,
With a cough she sprang to life,
Like a man kicked by his wife.
