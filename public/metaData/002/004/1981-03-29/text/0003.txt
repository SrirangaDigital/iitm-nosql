With a vengeance to make matters worse
She headed for my brother like a curse.
Two panicky cries melted into one,
As my brother broke into a run.
'stop it, you fool!' he cried,
'I don't know how,' I replied.
Twice around the house we flew,
'Fore I stopped in the way WR k I knew.
You see, I made a mistake,
Pressed the 'cellerator, not the brake,
The car shot bang into a ~ree,
And out leapt poor, battered me.
The car was flattened out of shape,
It resembled an over-ripe pancake,
It looked as if an attacking Hun
Had gone at it with a loaded gun.
Hopes vanished at his heaving brow,
Like food before a starving sow,
Anxiety heightened at his heaving chest,
But hope springs eternal in the hmman breast.
'It's not my fault,' I said,
Ducked a from a fist swing at my head,
Turning I ran for dear life,
â€¢
Like a henpecked husband from an enraged
wife.
