in the mess.
Solution

========

Number of tickets, n = 54.
Consider one person.
The probability of his ticket being picked the first time =(1 / n).
Probabi~&ty that it is not picked = (1 - lin).
Probability that it is not pickea even the second time = (1-1/n)(1-1/n).
Probability that it is not picked in all n draws
= ( 1 _ 1.n )n.
Probable number of persons getting consolation prize
= n x ( 1 _ 1. )n
n
The director will probably give away
Rs. [na(l_1.)n]
in the form of consolation prizes.
n

His expected profit is

p = 20a - na(l_1.)n
n

i.e.
p = 20a[l-2g(1-1/n)n]
At the critical value, the expression in the square brackets
becomes O.
n(l _ 1.)n = 20.
n

By trial, it is found that for n=54, p=0.32aj for n=55, p=-O.04a.
Thus the required value of n is 54.
