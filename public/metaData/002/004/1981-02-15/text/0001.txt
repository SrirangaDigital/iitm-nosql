MAGIC NUMBER

Consider the number M=588235294117647.
Multiply it by any number from 1 to 15. There will be a
zero in the answer. Starting from the number following the zero,
the digits of M will be repeated.
588235294117647 X ~ = 29411764701588235.

e.g.

~88235294117647

X 13= 76470158823529411_

Once, when a woman in a bus was caught for ticket less
travel, she insisted that the conductor hadn't given her a ticket.
In his rage, the conductor gave the woman a hard shove. She fell
out of the bus and was fatally run over.
Later, the conductor was sentenced to death on the electric
chair. He seemed very cheerful and was even laughing when he went
towards the chair. A reporter asked him why he was so self-sure.
He replied, 'I'm a bad conductor'.

Solution to last week's Brain Teaser
On the basis of the first clue, namely that the product of
the ages is 36, a large number of combinations is feasible.
The next clue lies in the fact that in spite of his having
known the sum of the ages, the census taker was unable to arrive
at the correct answer. This can only mean that there is more
than one combination of ages which ~ives the same sum. All
possible combinati,ns are given below.

combinatiohs, namely (9,2,2) and (6,6,1) can fulfil the
given conditions. Since the eldest daughter was sleeping
upstairs, it is obvious that their ages were 9, 2 and 2.
