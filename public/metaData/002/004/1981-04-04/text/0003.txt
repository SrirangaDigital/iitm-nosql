and agreeable man came out.
'Can I see Mrs Lalita Prasad?', I said
in a low, polite tone, adding a belated smile. Perhaps that gentleman heard only the words 'Lalita Prasad t , and heartily called me
in. I took a seat, and to my astonishment, he sat before me and
said, 'What do you want?'
But scandalous affairs like losing the keys of ladies~ toilets
cannot be disclosed to any person, putting the reputation of Mardi
Gras orgamisers in jeopardy. So I said tersely, 'But I want to
see Mrs Lalita Prasad; I have been sent here by Dimple,' thus
stressin~ diplomatically the word 'Mrs' and indicating the utmost
urgency of the matter by quoting the name of Dimple.
'But you can say that to me,' he said T While, totally confused,
I still insisted on getting his wife before me, he cut me short
with ' ••• for I am Lalita Prasad.'
I wonder if you have faced such a unique situation in your life,
when you have put the right name on the wrong sex. I never knew
and will never know what on earth I was to do in this situation.
Returning to the context, I should say that I found the key
at last, but MG volgnteering became a nightmare to me. So beware,
guys, never §et into such a mess.
