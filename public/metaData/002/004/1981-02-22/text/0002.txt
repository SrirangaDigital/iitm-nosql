water jug is bound to be missing. Even if a jug is on the table, it's
likely that it contains no water. [One has to be carefully attentive
to see that one's long sleeves are rolled up, failing which they would
pick up enough stains from the sticky table-top to put the stains on
their workshop uniforms to shame.]

11th Feb:
The day of the first perio. A long queue at breakfast hour
due to lack of plates. One of the inmates suggests to the Mess
Manager that the plates kept for lunch be utilized. The Manager
readily agrees and 'orders' the table cleaner to give the plates
at the catering counter. He cribs that there have been orders and
objec~ions against usage of these plates.
However, these plates
were used for giving omelettes. The Mess Manager (fatso) shrinks
into the kitchen like a mouse.
Inference: the will of our Mess Manager is not as stable ts
his physique.
13th Feb:
A scene of 8 boys sitting at the table at lunchtime. None of
them had tumblers. One of them cried for tumblers. The scurrying
server took pity and gave two tumblers from the adjacent table.
K shout for 6 more tumblers was heard. However, the tumblers were
supplied 10 minutes later, by which time all 8 had finished.
Inference: Slow and steady wins the race - the dishwasher
had to wash 6 tumblers less.
18th Feb:
The Mews Manager was overheard complaining to the Asst. Warden
there was no 'kalal' in any of the cooking vessels, and that steps
had to be taken immediately.
Inference: Even the Mess Manager complains about the kitchen.
20th Feb:
Overheard (from an inmate having bread and jam for lunch):
'This is the best lunch I have had here.'
Inference: Mandak mess is probably the only mess in which
members prefer bread for breakfast, lunch and dinner instead of
the usual grub served. X.
However, steps are being taken to improve the menu. The veg.
kitchen provides ws with hi-protein Chinese delicaCies, which sometimes include nutritious cockroaches and flies.
I observe another regular feature in our mess: the mess workers
prepare separate, special dishes for themselves, after everyone's
finished his supper, despite the regular dishes being available.
Inference: Even they don't consider the usual grub sufficiently
palatable.

Almost everyone of us enters the Man~ak storeroom to get
cool drinks. But I doubt if anyone had noticed a number of water
jugs lying idle on the shelves. Where two tables are put together
in the dining hall, I feel we could do with two water jugs per table.

The plates used for lunch can be used for breakfast too. The
breakfast timings have shifted to 7:00 a.m. onwa~ds instead of 6:30.
Our mess sec. should shift it back to 6:30 a.m. lince the perios have
started, there are many fellows who get up early believing that
'Late to bed and early to rise makes an lIT student a topper and wise.'
Hence some rush could be avoided on weekday mornings.
STOP PRESS: 21st Feb: The Asst. Warden had upma and omelette for
breakfast.

has it that bnly half the usual amount of milk was added to the
water.
