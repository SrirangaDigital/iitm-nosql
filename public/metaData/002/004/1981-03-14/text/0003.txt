Now he's the SLIM debonair owner of the lIT night club.
In the night club no one p~ays up the cabaret dancer,
For you see, muscleman Shekhar is the club bouncer.
Bhargave sings with Moses at the Guitar,
Kishore drums; as a group they'll go far.
Pondy was as you know always groovy,
These days he's acting as a villain in a movie.
Akela's a detective, always looking for a clue,
Nundoo teaches Karate and also Kung-fu.
Chelluri's set a new record by dropping the highest number of catches.
Chandramouli is the linesman for the Institute Volleyball matches.
Tambe's got over bikes, now he's on motors,
Dharmaraj is the President of the Madras Union of Doctors.
Vivek's a secret agent, deadly and cool,
With his gun he's called 'the man from Istanbul'.
Ben's latest best-seller is 'The Harmonic Mean',
Chitra's freaking out at the modelling scene.
Laxmi's kind of talent is rare,
She's the top photographer for Debonair.
Joykutty is now managing Quark,
Bharat is acting in 'Jaws III', obviously as the Shark.
Rajesh was the Dean of Students, recently got fired,
AB's the new superstar, as Amitabh Bacchan's retired.
