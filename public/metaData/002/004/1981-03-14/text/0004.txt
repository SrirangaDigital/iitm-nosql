However in spite of other pressing engagements, we have retyped

HOSTEL AFFAIRS
--K S Raghavan
It appears as if Mandakini inmates are generally dissatisfied
with the working of the hostel aQd we have taken it out on the
Mess workers. I feel that everyone should be judged equally.
To start with, the office seems to be working mn its own
svhedule. Notices are not put up in time and this causes a lot of
problems. I hope you remember how we nearly had to give Godav a
walkover in volleyball because our office didn't put up the notice.
Therei is yet another incident which affected only a few of us but
is still worth mentioning. A few weeks ago I saw a notice announcing
a South Zone level Bridge Tournament to be held this weekend. Now
the notice is not there. One also sees a number of notices announcing
events like inter-hostel quiz, etc. which are already over.
Another im~ortant point about the office is that the secretaries
are not getting the money they want for various things in time.
Seshadri will tell you how long he has to wait to get money for
purchasing sports equipment.
Shajan has been wanting to discuss our November mess bill with
Any guess as to what happens next.
Finally coming to the students., my only complaint is the
spilling of food in the mess. I request the students to be more
careful in future. (For their own good as Shajan is thinking of
fining anyone who fiii spills a bucket of sambar or likewise.)
