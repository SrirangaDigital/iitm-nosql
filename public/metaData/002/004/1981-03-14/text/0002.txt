These five years are the years, when we should enjoy
ourselves, and what I mean by enjoyment is good clean fun.
It is high time we threw our narrow-mindedness to the winds
and became free. It is also high time we avoided chauvinistic
views and looked at matters objectively_

While passing by Sarayu one day,
While passing by Sarayu one day,
I spotted her happy and gay,
In the sizzling month of May,
With those swaying hips,
I saw a luscious blonde,
And coloured lips
But God! Did I get conned!
She left me staring away_
Not knowing that mirages never
stay.

While retrieving the pants went

Where, stayed a b0Y, tall and

With an upturned nose
And a photogenic pose
He'd refuse a trip to Quark.

About which I heard a remark:

'Cos they have an LED,
They think they can burn in the
dark. '

To hide which he called himself
