CRICKET
Come Saturday, we saw some pleasant, enjoyable and wellorganised matches. All the matches proved to be virtual walk-overs,
but for one, which provided a scintillating finish: This was the
match b~tween the first floor wings.
Alok Dhir and Co. batted first and hit up 84 runs in the
stipulated 10 overs, with a useful contribution of 31 by Natraj.
Set a target of 85 to win, Chelluri and Co. started disastrously,
till Seshadri came to their rescue with a hurricane knock of 33.
The last ball found Ben with the following alternatives: a sixer
would fetch a win, a four a tie, and anything less a defeat.
'Anything less' resulted, since the ball landed one foot sho~t of
the two-run boundary.
Some good performances'were by Ramki (31), Hari (44),
Seshadri (33), Natraj (31), anp Shyam. There was some good bowling
by K.Sri, AB, and Shyam.
301 - 332 could not make it to the finals, although Hari
swung his balls well.
The teams which made it were AS and Co., and Shyam and Co.
The finals will be held next weekend.

TEASERS

A census taker want to a house and asked the man who opened the
door his age and the ages of those in his family. The man told him
his age and said, 'I have three daughters. I won't tell you their
ages, but the product of their ages is 36
The census taker
thought for a short while and said, 'Tell me some more.'
'The sum of their ages is one less than the number of the house
next door.' The census taker went to the next house and came back
after some time. He said, 'I still CdN't get their ages. Can you
give me another clue?'
'My eldest daughter is sleeping upstairs. Do you now know
their ages?'
'Yes, I do,' said the censul taker.
WHAT ARE THEIR AGES?
[Every statement or fact is significant.]
Solution next week.
