SOLUTiON TO LAST WEEK'S CHESS PROBLEM IN RETRO-ANALYSIS
---~--~-------~-------~--~----~~-----~--~------~--~--~-

The Bishop is at QR3.
Let us analyse the position carefully.
The first hint which we can get is
the double QNPs. This shows that some
black piece or other must have been
captured by the white QRP at QN3;
but the only black piece missing is
the KP. But obviously it cannot be
the KP. Hence it should only be the
Knight. But Black already has two
Knight's, so it is clear that the
Knight at Q8 must have come by the
queening of KP. White has lost only
a pawn and a Bishop. So black's move
was ••• P X 8 = N. So it is the White
Bishop which had been lost.
Therefore, the other Bishop is at QR3.

HOWZAAT!
An expecting father rang up the hospital to enquire about
his wife who was undergoing labour. He rang up the Cricket
Stadium by mistake where an interesting match was in progress.
'How's it coming?', he asked.
'It's going on fine. We have already got two out, and one more
is on the way. The last one was a duck.'

If cosa is less than 1, a a is acute and if cosn is
greater than 1 a is obtuse.

If the x-component of the force is Fx and the v-component
is zero, the resultant is at 45 degrees to x-axis.

Octa means 6. In maths you learn that Octa is eight,
but in practice Octa is 6.
5.
Charge = charge density X Area.
q

= oA

Multiplying both sides by 1,
qL = oAL

Now we see that L is common on both sides of the equation.
Therefore, cancelling L we get
q

6.

= aA.

In e = 0.9999993.
