One day in the life of
I.I.T.IAN Nofundawhich
This modern I. LT. ian wakes at nine
[The alarum stopped at seven]
And by the time he starts classward
Its bordering on eleven
And why the two hours? you may ask,
Before he wakes at last
[Though after all there is naught in the mess,
Worth calling a breakfast!]
The battle between sleep and conscience
Is the cause of this lengthy halt.
And conscience having "chicken" pox
Morpheus wins by defaul.
This poor soul finally arrives
And trying to enter under cover
Is caught I and told with biting wit
That he's early for the next hour
The next hour being lunch.
Small wonder, this reminder
Sets the tummy rumbling loud.
And his mind begins to wander.
To visions of steaming brown liquids,
Water from defunct coolers and
Chappatis as dryas dust
With rice as grainy as sand.
And so our friend Nofundawhich
lives up to his illustrous title.
Of what's going on in the room
He knows much less than little.
From this mental misadventure
The worst must sure befall
For, oh the irony of lifel
He misses his roll call.
And brooding over this tragic deed
With every swig of boiling 'rasam'
Nofandawnich? As usual decides
He is a no-good bum
And no no-good bum ever derived
Anything by going to classThe afternoon session therefore
Is spent with Morpheus
