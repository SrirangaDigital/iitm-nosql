Great confidence sown ....
is great confidence grown
The leap from traditional agriculture to
scientific agriculture is not merely a matter of techniques.
It is a moral and a psychological leap towards the future.
Maharashtra State Seeds Corporation is deeply aware of this.
The MSSC'S efforts therefore are to involve the farming community
in the total process of modernizig agriculture.
The MSSC's Mahabeej seeds contain the joint effort of not only the
State Government and agricultural universities but also thousands of farmers in Maharashtra.
Mahabeej is no ordinary seed: It is the seed of Scientific development through co-operation.
At MSSC we have one slogan: Sow great, grow great

Mahabeej the seed of
scientific agricultural development.
