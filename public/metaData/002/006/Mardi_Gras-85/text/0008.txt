Chairman, Souvenir Committee

Along with Pongal and the Cricket Test Match, the
New Year heralds for the Madras IITian the Gerhard
Fischer al)d Kokila Rajaiah Basketball tournaments, and
the Mardi Gras.

As far as the former are concerned,

they have grown from strength to strength, attracting
the best talent,

and played in our inimitable OAT,

and spreading joy and good cheer all round.

The Mardi

Gras has evoked mixed feelings, even among students,
with the faculty being cultured ~nough to look upon
this cultural festival with tolerance.

However, it has

always provided, at leaSt for the organizers, participants and the freshmen, considerable enjoyment and
satisfaction.

It still enjoys a tremendous reputation at

other colleges, who look forward to this event with
much eagerness.

A lot of planning, organization
into these annual

and

hard

work go

events, and I do hope that they

would provide the Madras IITian-be he/she a student
or staff member-a lot of enjoyment and relaxation.
