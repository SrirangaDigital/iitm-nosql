HOnly those countries which apply the latest results
of science vigorously and continuously will hold their
own under the stress of international competition:'
SHRI RAM
the legendary figure
behind DCM

OCM is always evolving new
techniques and new processes.
That is how the tiny textile mill
of 1889 snowballed into one of
the largest industrial groups
today. All this might have
remained an idea in the crevices
of a dreamer's mind, but for
the constant innovation of
technology in our company
over the years.
The result is that 'OCM today
produces goods ranging from

textiles to sugar to industrial
chemicals to PVC to fertilizers
to tyre cord to electronic
business machines to engineering
products. You name it and
OCM has it.
OCM is forever branching off
into newer fields. Because we
think of it as a debt that we
owe to posterity.
All of which is part of the
OCM spirit.
