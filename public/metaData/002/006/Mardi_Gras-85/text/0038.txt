No matter which Fiesta
you pick you'll be in luck!
A varied and popular menu, pleasing
surroundings and terrific service make
Fiesta a favourite retreat.
And there is a chain of Fiestas! A mobile
eaterie on a Madras beach, a regular
restaurant in the city and at the airport Off
Bangalore airport too and on a picturesque
beachfront in Pondicherry..... And at most
of the Spencer's branches.
Fiesta restaurants suit you equally for a
qUick bite, a leisurely meal and a business
date. So why eat anywhere else?
