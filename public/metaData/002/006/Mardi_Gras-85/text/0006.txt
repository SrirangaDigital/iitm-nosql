Prof. J. C. Kuriacose
Dean Students

This year our students have given expression to their
innovative planning by combining two important
extracurricular activities, the BasketbalJ tournaments for
the Gerhard Fischer and Kokila Rajaiah trophies and
the cultural festival. The Basketball tournaments have
earned a great popularity and every year the campus
community looks forward to it.
The quality of the teams competing and the spirit
that permeates the event has provided entertainment
and pleasure to the spectators.
Both the Basketball tournament and the cultural festival
provide the students opportunities to show their
organisational abilities and to demonstrate their extra
academie talents.
The joy these events bring to the campus community
and the satisfaction it gives the organisers and
participants in sharing this joy and making others
happy through tht! talents they possess will be the
real measure of the success of the tournaments and
the cultural festivaL

I wish everyone relaxation, enjoyment and a lot of
clean fun. I hope that the efforts put in this year
will touch a large cross section of the student
community, giving them the opportunity to develop/
display their talents each in the variety and measure
in which it is given to him/her. May these days of
gaiety and fun be very rewarding days for the Institute.
