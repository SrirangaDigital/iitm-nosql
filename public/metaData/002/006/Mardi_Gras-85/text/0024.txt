Bacchus Bacillus Meets
Muggo Muthu
Bacchus Bacillus of choleric fame,
Engaged to a small poxed dame,
Had ravaged each Indian state
Accompanied by his future mate.
The WHO bigwigs soon did unbend
To put this menace to an end.
So that, after quite a while,
Bacchus's dame was declared sterile.
This shock was of such an awesome bend
That it unhinged Bacchus's mind
Maddened, furious and amazed,
Up and down the land he raced.
Cholera! Cholera! day and night,
And very few were spared its bite
Soon in his pride foolish Bacchus
Ventured into I.I.T Campus.
And spotted Muggo under a tree
Gazing fondly at the library
Which,after a mighty fight,
He had left at 10 at night.
Oh poor, ignorant virus
Foolish, senseless

Bacillus.

Did you really, truly never dream
Of the terrors of Muggo's bloodstream?
Bacchus expired with a plunk.
For Muggo Mutthu was drunk
With the joys of high physics
And Applied Thermodynamics.
