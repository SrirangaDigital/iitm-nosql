Bring him to his knees by inferring that
he is an idiot e.g.: "But after aU.
Mr. Guggenkopf, isn't two plus two
just four?"

6., Make the student repeat the question
several times while you look at the
class with a pleading expression. This
suggests at once that he mumbles, does
not
enunciate,
or
cannot
express
himself clearly.
NOTE: In the case of foreign students
this method should be used first.

If there seems to be no other way out
resort to

technique

(b) Difficult; mildly interesting
This category includes a fairly large num ..
ber of subjects which require blackboard
presentation. Although the methods discussed
for (a) find wide application in this field, the
content of this section will deal mainly with
the cardinal topic of blackboard technique.
Two separate cases occur here:
1.

Good text-book is readily available.

2.

No single text covers the work.

1. Since it is necessary to give only supplementary details on the board you have here
a golden opportunity to assert your personality. The most important characteristic to
develop is the writing.
It should be smaH,
especially effective in big rooms, and hovering
on the brink of illegibility.
A most briHiant example of originality ;n
this field was first reported just a few years
ago. It consists of stating a lengthy law in
one breath, looking
disappointed when
several cries of "Uhhhh 7", Whazzat ?", "What
the ......... " are heard, walking over to the
board with a resigned expression, and with
great dignity writing:

Tfoabtmvatpotmaiatsotdbt
To see the blank expressions on their
faces before somebody figures out "The force
of attraction •...•. " is one of life's rare little
pleasures.
Another gratifying result is obtained by
writing a complicated expression on the board
and then with a chalk craser rapidly wiping and
altering inverting and canceHing until the
answer is arrived at. This will inevitably
bring great cries from the students. You
can interpret them as signs of admiration for
the rapidity of your mental processes.
2. In this case it is necessary to provide
a reasonable amount of information by means
o~

the blackboard.

One highly recommended procedure for
keeping one step ahead of the class consists
of commencing to write immediately on
coming in and continuing to do so until the
very end of the lecture. The writing should be
accompanied by a running commentary into
the board; enunciation should be limited to
the result of any sequence of operations
described.

e.g.

Another popular method is the WPTT procedure. The technique consists of the above
with addition of stepping back, looking at the
board,
stepping forward, writing another
line, and saying " ......... which proves the
theorem." Fifteen seconds later the boards
are wiped clean. Ensuing questions are
treated as per (a) above. The psychological
effects of this on the students are too obvious
to warrant discussion.
When properly used, the black board
eraser can be an effective tool in establishing
the lecturer's superiority. Great effects have
been achieved by not erasing the previous
work completely and writing between the
smudges, not erasing the previous work at
all and writing on top of it, erasing each
