Ananthakrishnan •• Jamuna.
It was a very important match. It needed the best
out of I\nanthu if Jamuna had to do something. Ananthu
did not let his hostel down. He played a neat, complete
and well-planned innings of 44. He then -took the ball and
returned with figures of 7-0-1 E ·4
This starlin.; display saw
that Jamuna ran away vict~rs by a comfortable margin of
70 runs. And the man who did it is our man of the weeka 3rd year Chern. student.
