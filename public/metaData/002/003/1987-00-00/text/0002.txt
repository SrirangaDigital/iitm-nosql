Hi everybody!
Yet egain a neW year has bag un, heralded for a change by seniors
and not thf' freshi es. But this yeElr t her e is a marked di fference in
senior-freshie relations 'due to dogmatic high~r authoritips. The
freshi~-senior Chit-Chat-Over-A-Cup-Df-Tea (CCOACOT)ritual b~ing now
reduced to nothing, has evoked a catpgorical statpment from th~
Tarams tea wallah that his sales have now peached an abysmall
nadir, unlike the p~evious years, owing to the lack of se~iors
baptising freshies with the (or unholy?) Tarams tea. The [CDACDT
uncharacteristically termed "ragging" has now vanished becausp of
hordps of wardens nrowling about the hostels after 9 pm (these
are thfr peak hours at Qua~k and Tarams) thus erecting a ba~~ier
between the freshies and the seniors.
It is felt that the now rule against "ragging" is unjust to the core
as there has been no instance of unwarT'antcd be"aviour on the part
of thE' seniors so far.
'The incident' of last year, as is felt
by the entire lIT junta, was certainly grossly misinterpreted and
blown out of proportions. Keeping this in mind, junta feels t~t
the extreme threat of rustication (corrosion of iron) is uncalled
for. Nevertheless, we editors, join hands with the entirF. lIT
popUlation in extending a warm welcome to the freshies and hope they
have a f~eaky time he~e.
Now on Convo '8S. As it Was the S~er Jubilee Convocation, there
was an entertainment programme organised, which was a fitting finale
to the convo. This year, the SAC was better decorated and more
ventilated with a number of fans (upside down, though!)." The lIT
this year institutpd a new degTee, viz. M5 in Entrepreneurship.
"Th er e was also a Ph.D in H um~ni ties award ed to a blind CAndidate.
The ~ppl~use for him was deaiening, definitply.
The condition of water (or Coffee?) in the hostel s~cto~ nowad~ys
is des pic"3ble. The W?tEr is browner than mud.' Students are sc~red
to haVE a bath. About th~ mess water, the less said thE better ..
And now we think th?t it is high time WE introduced ourselves.

All th~t we have to say nbout ourselVES is that we are basicnlly
nice guys (atleast we try to be so). fortranic~lly ••••••
Now tOUChing on the less import~nt features (Oh really!). We propose
to have competitions at regular intervals, the first of which is
fentured in this issue. We cxrect high enthu in the form of
SPECT~TOR response.
The prizes are really big And attractiVe.
On both the Sports and Lit fronts, activity has begun, tho' it
must be said that in the latter, the freshie enthu waS infinitesimal.
Now read on .....
