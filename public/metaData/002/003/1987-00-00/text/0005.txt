the renouned theologiRn and thr Fpeakpr this time, did anything
but enthrall. He expounded on the topic, "Sci~ncr, ~eligion and
Manit which ha-rdly bC'cC'tme '" lrctuI'E' of his stending.
AnywaY1 f r the rocord, Dr. Srngup~~ s~id that he SAW no conflict
b['tween Science and ReI igi on. Science, he :wE'rred, cl"ltered to man's
physical being while Religjon c'iscipllnf'd his r.'lind.
And Science,
he felt, could ~ot [xpl~i~ t~e tr~nscendentAl.

~NSTITUTE OPEN QUIZ FQfLH~S:

Tlle:::-e WAS no lock of enthu in this
EVEnt which WAS held on "1~th August. The questinns set by
thG co-ords WEre extremely interesting and of A very good stAndArd.
Surprisingly, stress srcmed tn hcv~ bren Inid on Lit fundAs.

STOP r"~!:~ :Of the 12 people Who qualifadq, here we
reproduce only 19 names. The other two ar2 no~ b~ing
publiShed as th~ co-ord refused to diVulge the n-meS eVen
