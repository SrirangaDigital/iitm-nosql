THE STEEL-NERVED STEALER

Godavari Hostel, 13th May.
This hostel WaS th~ scene of a series of sensation~l thefts. The
thief who WAS some kind of A Superman beca11se of his exceptionAl
stre"gth, wr~.ched open Godrej 6 lever N~vtal locks, possibly the
safEst in the market. Fortun::"tely for the hostel inmatt>s, th e th ief
brcke op€n two totAlly empty rooms (301, 302) out of the six thA~t
he opened.
Str~ngely, a calculator (fx-68) and a used Powder Tin
are the only things reported missing.
The rooms, tho' were totally
ransaked.
The theft WaS believed to have occurred sometime around
2 in the afternoon. But the robbery waS discovered as late as
1 in the Same eVening by one of oar editors.
As regRrds the identity of the robber, one student reported th~t
he saW e Negro moving about suspiciously in onp of the seC end floor
wings.
There are rumours floating ~bout thAt this robber is the
Same one who had relieved a few 'smart' IITiAns of their c~lculators.
Our man, we hear here, has a penchant for KVIITi~ns (or rather
ex-KVIITians) tho' now he is slowly diversifying.
The security, acting fast, called in experts to inveetigate.
After
the investigation, they h~d thE rooms sealed. The security
guard also used·to come ~nd check thrice a d~y, Here we must state
th~t when a vict~m returned and tried to open his doort the whole
latch (lock ~nd all) c~me off in hie hands.
The missing cal-c and the

POWDER TIN have not been

tr~ced.

Th~ new eo-ords of Quark S~em to be doing something concrete for
the hungry lIT junta at last.
So far, by current indications,
visitors to QUark (uptill 1J O'clock atleats) do get some stuff
to eat.
The co-ords are coming out with new innov?tions and
additions to the daily routine.
They hnve brought in Beef,
Sarnosas, Panneer with Pprotta etc. By what we hear, the sales
h~ve really improved.

Overheard: Glamour (1) at Quark bes bacome non-existent because
Sarayu is not putting enough enthu
(Are th e guys to blame?)
