INTFq HOSTEL

E~SKFTP~L~

The very ides Jf holding inter hostel sports h~s become
qUEstion8ble, wh.=1t with the AbS(11ute lAck of pnthu. Apprt from
plnyers., refrees, C'lnd .
of penrle like scorers and
spectator rerorters, And ~ h~ndful of supporters, no one else
lAnds up, rllr'lking the,
, as it is drab, disrlr"1y even more dr~b.
The stAndard (1f umpiring, scnrekepring ~nd punctuality (wh~t is
that???) in starting the games leave much to be discussed.
Coming to the basketb,ll part nf it, Sprr'lYu for once Mlmost
played their 2nd m~tch, thus bp'ng on the verge of cr~ati~g
history, thanks to an enthuless disrlny by Manrl?k, who but for
~?rtin and Yerlr'lc would h~ Ve definitely lost.
Bad luck SArayu,
after all that ceaseless dnily practice. 5Aras then beat MandAk
And JnmunA beAt ~lAk tn enter thp leqgue stqge. The teAms in
the le?gup Were SF1ri"s, fllpk, NArme8 Find GOdAV ..
Bnth NarmAdA and S~r~s, with prActicAlly ~ll the plC'lyers
(institutp) h~rl ~n FASY time, beating both Godav An0 Jamuna PAsily.
GOdAV could come only 3rd, inspite of th?t terrific (by now
infAmous) , snnorouS cheering squFlD of theirs, who literAlly
give their opposition ~ ~un for their eArs.
J~mun~ deserves A word of rraise for their good show, inspite
of h.ving ? rractically ~ll-frpshie teAm. BhA~At and quts did
well for them. They should do rretty well next yeat, with so
mFny institute pl~yers from S8rAs end NArmadR, passing o~t this
ye':'lr

The finAl match turned out to be the decider, betwepn Sarris
and NArmrldA. Saras eventuFllly pirred NarmFlda C'lt the post, nfter
going throug~ tense moments. It wns very clrse ?nd the m~tch
could hAve gone either WAY'
Fot' Narmada, M?noj, Siren, and
NAvepn pl~yed ? gt'F8t gAme while fnr S~r~s ftn~nd rlAyed well,
th~ugh it w~s SrinAgesh, with his terrific long shots who really
impresspd for Saras. The SarAs c~rtAin ~nand, looked disgruntled
throughout the mC'ltch, And Was constAntly cribbing at his plAyers.
