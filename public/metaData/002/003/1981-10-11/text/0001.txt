Our team lost to National College,Bengalore

75 - 55 in tho

quarter finals of the Feasto Inter-Collegiate Basketball Tournament.
at Calicut(we were seeded directly into the quarter finals}.The
first half saw some inspired play by our team,Chandu and Raja
dese~ving

mention. We led 35 - 34 st the breather.

In the second

half, Nationals changed their tactics with Sanath Kumar(of 'Bangkok I fame)' bottling up Raj a.

With Raj a rendered hors de combat,

we resorted to desperate tactics , and committed too many fouls in

the bargain.

Scorers for us were Chandu(19), Raja(12), Gadi(9'.
Cheering reachod its comical peak, the crowd dividing
