lIT BOMBAY 'cruiso' past KV lIT

88-67.

---~~---~---------------------~

KV I IT, a last-minute replacement fo r Loyola, put up another
plucky display but were torpedoed by the wiles qnd guiles of Lt.
George Louis.

this navyman, with his fakes and clever passes,

(sometimes fuesving his own teammates bemused), was a real treat
to behold.

Ashwin Joshi and Sabahnayagam too threw their weight

around effectively to clinch the issue for Bombay.

KV lIT did

not settie down and try fo r set shots, but tried drive-ins instead.

KV relied heavily on Ganguly and RAmesh Singh, while

Somasunder's dribbling was a sight -for s ore eyes.
With this encounter, they have completed all their
engagements.

Well played, KV IIT!
