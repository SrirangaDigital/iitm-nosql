Things 'are warming up, so's the race fOr the coveted schroeter-

One t iling is almost certain: Godav, champs for the last two years,

will be handing over the Schroeter to some other hostel.
The time is ripe for all the sports sees to dish out their optimistic/pessimistic

CRICKET
(as explained to a foreigner)
You have two sides, one out in the field and one in.
Each man who's in the side that's in goes out and when he is out
he comes in and the next man goes in until he is out.
When they're all out the side that's out comes in and the side
that's been in goes out and tries to get those coming in, out.
Sometimes you get men still in and not out.
When both sides have been in and out
iftclud~ng

the not outs,

that's the end of the game.
