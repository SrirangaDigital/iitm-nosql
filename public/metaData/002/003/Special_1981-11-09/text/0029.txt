tt1hy do you people have three periodicals c. week? Why not h?ve
two she t periodicals one c ter the other i." n a fixed dey of
the week? Also I suggest that une make a calendar of ell
sports, cul Â·t urcl, etc events right at tl- e beginning of the
ye2ro This will help 2 student to pl2n out his studies 2nd
extra-curricular ?ctivities. Thirdly, I think more importcnce
should be given to 10wer levels of participation like the

Fin2,1Iy. Sir, what do you think of SPECTI:.TOR?

I:

Ohl SPECTATOR is very good.

This yec~ r the !J ucli ty of all
campus magazines h?s improved. SPECTATOR h?s a cre2.tive role
to play. There should be a bCl12nced view.. You people bring
out the jovial siGe while FOCUS cries 211 the timeo A ~erger
of SPECTATOR and FOCUS may help (Oh, no!).
