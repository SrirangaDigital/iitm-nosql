ONE FINAL

~NORD

The idea of a bouncer originated some
time back - we had planned one un Srir2.It'.
Memorinl/Scetha Memorial - both were not
conducted. Next we had the Inter-lIT
Sports Meet coming, c.nd th?t was it.
Interviewing twenty person?li ties of
various sizes and shapes and mental 2~iliÂ­
ties - from the exubcr2nt Murali to the
curt Miss Usha Sundaram
turned out tu
be a novel experience.
The stationery procurement WeS made a lot easier by
Erof. Srinivasan's swift action. Next/ we wanted to be
different - and we found out how
Mr Nat?raj2n and Mr
Srinivas2cn at the Director's office ?llowed us to use the
electric typewriter. From type to print takes ~ome cffurt
~nd time - both on machine and man.
Badri did our cyclostyling in <:I.bs. :r.-ecord time. ~ve gave him 15 ,000 pages to
cyclostyle, and we got ~ack 14,995 perfect in 011 respects
- for an amazing 99.9b % EFFICIENCY. Mr Swamy of the
Reprographic Section took one look C.t our cover design 2nd
felt that anything less than offset printing WGuld n~t do
justice to the design. We got our cover page in 8 hvurs
flat.
