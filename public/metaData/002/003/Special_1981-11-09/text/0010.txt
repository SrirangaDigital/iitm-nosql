s:

Gymnastics is one sport. where none of us have any fundas.
don't ~utell us somethin( about it?

M~

There are six events in all: floor (exercises) I vaulting
horse, pommelled horse par2llel bars, Ro~an rings and horizontal. Well, not only you guys, but no one here seems to
care or even know about gymnastics. The facilities are bad.
We buy equipment only once in five years when we host the
inter-lIT. The Gymkhana must do something to promote end
popularise gymnastics.

How do you ra.te your chances?

M:

It will be close between Bombay and us.

s~

With such poor standards and .low spectator valuer do you think
it is worth having gymnastics at inter-lIT?
Agreed, standards are baq. but one shouldn't expect something
like Olympic grace hereo It sh~uld be relatively scaled downc
In the South l gymnastics i~ not a sport, it is a stunt
(Quotable quote?)
I think gymn2.stics could be dropped.
