Here's a thought for our sportsmen going to KGP:
"That which we are, we are;
One equal temper of heroic hearts,
Made weak by time and fate, but strong in will
To strive, to seck, to find, and not to yieldo"
- Alfred, Lord Tennysono
SPECTATOR wishes our contingent all the best in their
quest for the General Championship for th8 eleventh time in
succession.,

day between matches: this is not\"'he case if it is he.J..d

last year?

Without doubt:
'Team Spirit'
The atmosphere was just
right for cricket, it breathed of cricket·
We had team
meetings before every match where we discussed strategy
for the next match, etc
Eaually important was Sagar winning the t03S in all the matches.
