SPECTATOR goes to Sarayu to find out about
the girls' side of things.

S:

Do you think an inter-lIT meet is
necessnry? Should ladies' events be
included in them?

U:

I go to inter-lIT only for person21
pleasure.
I enjoy playing baddy.

K:

Inter-lIT is a must. Since IITs h?ve
12dies, there must obviously .' ~e ladies'
events
Most men's events h2ve points
of 10-6-2. I think they should make it
5-3-1 for the girls instead of tbe existing 10-6-2. They
could also introduce ladies' tennis.
