INTERVIEW WITH DIVAKAR REDDY

s:

How do you rate our chances and our
football team?

D:

We have a good chance of coming second.
Our main rivals are KGP and Bombay.
KGP have regularly been winning it.
Compared to last year, our team is better (we got a bronze last year).

S:

How about your practice during the semester and during the coaching camp?

D:

We haven't practised much during the semester. But we play
matches every Saturday. On the whole, football enthu has
increased this year. Ashok Dlsa is a promising find. Unfortunately, due to a compulsory aca9emic trip to Jampot !
will not be able to attend the first half of the coaching
camp. I will delegate my responsibilities to Billy in that
period. We will be havin~ Mr. Kuppuswami, a national coach.

S:

Who are your key players?

D:

I rely on Boutha, Burman, Billy and of course Satish Pai for
success

What do you thick of Mad!:'as winning inter-lIT 10 times?

D:

I like it.

What do you think of the football fields in the various IITs?

D:

The Delhi and Bombay grounds are lousy. In our institute facilities are good but enthu is lousy. But more important is
the time for which matches are scheduled - for example, we'll
be playing all our matches at ~ and 3 in the afternoon.

S:

What are the chances of our team getting injured?

0:

Before we return, at least five players will be injured.

We should keep it up.
