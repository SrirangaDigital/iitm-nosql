INTERVIEW WITH V

What is the overall impression you have of
your team?
75 % of t e guys in this year's athletic
team are new and a lot would depend on how
they shape up at the meet. We have been
weakened in throws by the loss of Chandy
and Chiefo Our team may look weak on paper
but we are very strong on the track.

S:

What are you doing about improving the
throws team?

V:

Nothing much I can do except hope that Peza, Burman and Ranganathan put in plenty of hard wvrk.

S:

Who are the track stalwarts in your team?

V:

This year, everyone is of such a high standard that no one can
take his place in the team for any particular event for granted.
Anyway I Sridhar is bound to wii .. 2 gOlo.3o Manimaran and Palapis2.my are also good. Distance events should be cash for
George, Sunder I Harihar and mea In 110 m hurdles Sithu should
get a gold. Only 400 m is our Acnilles! heel - we have no
explosive runners like Sandy (lIT K) ~

S:

How come Sunder didn't run during the selections?

V:

He was anyway in the team and there is not much point in a
runner running if he is not in training
