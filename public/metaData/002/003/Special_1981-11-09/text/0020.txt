in there with 10 feet more in breadth. J really liked the
Delhi court
The court is sunk in wjth galleries 2bove. This
improves concentration and helps one to sight the shuttle
clearly rather than against the background of the crowd.

S:

What shuttles do they use in inter-lIT?

flJ:

Indian2 shuttles - they promised to send us 20 doz for practice but they haven't yet arrivedo
ActuallYI it's uite an
expensive cffair - each shuttle costs Rs 5 and one needs 2-3
shuttles per match.

Revi

What is the form2t in Ba.ddy in inter-lIT?

M:

3 singles, 2 doubles. Each team gives in players A, Band C
before the match. A p12Ys A, B plays B aneC plays C. A lot
of thuught goes into this crucial affC'ir and there ill an element of luck involved. The only place where the umpire can
goodhal is in revea.ling your dr2.w to the opponents.

Every YE: a r, we seem to someh ,.:;w pull through and win the GC.
But if we lost it, I would be s2d" Perhaps inter-lIT could
be held less fre uently.

S:

Finally I wha.t do you think of SPECTATOR?

M:

It is a good effort. The coverage is nice. The regularity
is amazing. Every Monday I expect not to see it but it' s
always there. Perhaps you could C'lt down on PJs
