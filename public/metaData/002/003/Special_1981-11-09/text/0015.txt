How do you rate your chences?
I'm cock sure of victory. I don't
think we shuuld have any problems in
getting back the gold that we richly
deserve.
S:

How are you so confident?

R:

The volleyball teams of previous years
lacked cohesion. (Oh,reallyl) This
year we have excellent understanding
and co-ordination between the offence
and the defence. But please, we should be given decent umpires - last year's story should not be repeated.
S:

How he.s the practice been going?

R:

The boys are a dedicated lot, we've been training regularly.
Right now we're in the transition period - changing over from
leather balls to synthetic (.;·nes. The synthetic balls are
very smooth and hence di~ficult t o controlo Also their bounce
and wobble is not uniform.

S:

Does your team depend on any key players?

R:

No, we don't depend on any une player.

S:

How are the facilities?

R:

I haven't

S:

Do you think

R:

As a sportsmal~ I look forward to it but as a student I :teel
we could channel the money spent on it for other purposes.
The inter-lIT is supposed to foster better understanding
among the students~ well, seeing the last few meets, I'm
led to believe that it has done everything except its c.iro.

S:

Any plans for the camp?

R:

Yeah, exercises to improve physical fitnecs in the mornings

Everyone contributes

reason to crib.
