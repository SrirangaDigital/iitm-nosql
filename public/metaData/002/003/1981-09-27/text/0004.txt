A

good crowd saw eight teams being selected out of the twenty-

two that participated.

In the prelims we had some Wilde guesses,

Among those who made it to the finals,

five were entirely second year teams, one final year team and two
mixtures.

The final winners and runners-up were also second-years.

At :LT, the stage was

while the audience watching them amounted to only twenty-six
persons.

There were 48 personalities (6 rounds) given.
