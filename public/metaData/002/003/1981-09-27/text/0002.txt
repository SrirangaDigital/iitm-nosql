avo~d

the number

by

me~ber

of your team

(and not the co-ordinator) gue s , this is an all-tlme first.
S:

Don't you think the scoring system does not motivate the participants
to limit the number of questions!

And 2500 points is too wide a

gap to be bridged by bonuses of 300?

So the team that gets the

least number of 2500s wins, and the rest of the scoring system adds
up to nothing but embellishments?
J:

To a certain extent you are right.

We should incorporate some

modifications next time.

S:

How about giving fancy and locally famous

person~lities

(Billa of

B & R fame?, Resnick of R & H fame?, Diro?) to add a tinge of
colour? As it is, the fictitious chacters were a lot of fun.
J:

It could be done. But it would have to be tried in the hostels
first.

As for fictional characters, most of them are either too

easy or too tough.

S:

What was the standard like this time?

J(

In the prelims it touched rock bottom, but it was pretty decent
in the finals.

S:

How come the finals at CL T drew a poor crowd?

J:

At the orelims, the crClwd

wa~

good.

But probacly because we held

the finals on Saturd"lY morning a"t 8.30 a.m., tIle cro.tJd was thin.
S:

What was the hurry to finish tne

wh~l8

alfair, prelims, finals

and all within 15 hours?
J:

We had booked elT on Saturday morning for tho inter-collegiate
quiz.

Since this got postponed to October 17, we decided to sub-

stitute it by
S:

TintorQ~to.

Do you think it is f9ir to allow

part~ciDants

to question and fird

out the first letter of the name, the second letter, and so on?
J:

I think it's OK, since, in the first plAce, it gets. one nowhere
and secondly, it's a waste of time.

S:

Is a code like this allowed?

Question:

Europe or Asia?

By pre-arrangement, if the answer is "Yes", it means Europe; and
if the answer is "Alson, it means Asia.
J:

No, it may be objected to.

S:

Thanks a lot.
