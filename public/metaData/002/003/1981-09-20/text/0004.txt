all the way with the lead changing J::ands iL_ UVEJry g'a.me. The second game

BASKET1~

Gamsa beat Jamuna 59-31. Top seeds amd winners for the last fo~
years, Ganga cruised past their nc ighbours Jarrl1ma in a match of no consequence. The victors carried too many guns (they have four instt. shooters
in their ranks) for their rivals, led 3~4 ~t one stage, thereafter the
Ganga socond string took over. The match w~s played in a festival mood
with Jamuna introducing their Gen. Sec. Fij i9 who played football with' the
basketball and also with Pengu of Ganga. R~dhakant waged a lone battle
for Jamuna. (Baja 18, Venu 1?) (Radhakant 12)

of the motivation provided by a frienuly wager of 3s. 2 per goal between
the teams, the top seeds could muster but one goal c ~he Bra~s team held
their fort admirably and with a little bit of luck could hav8 tied the tie.
