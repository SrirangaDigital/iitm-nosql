E.g.when A is opposite- G (good player), ne may be

Can you suggest how these drawbacks can be eliminated?_
C:

They are eliminated by seeing which players are reasonably good (by
past performance), and distributing them on both sidwu

of the table,

trying to See that good players do not alternata on either side.

In-

the second goodhal is eliminated.

But this is practicable only for

seven pairs or less.

Since we have nine pairs for the finals, we
shall be following the n 2 system.
To eliminate both the goodhals, one must follow the 2n(2n-1) system,
which is suitable only for

In this system,

one side remains stationary, and all the others move around

in a cyclic faShion.

But the more the participants, the mare difficult

it is to conduct.
S:

What modifications would you like to incorporate during the year?

C:

Firstly, the 2n{ 2n-1) system. Secondly, if the first teem passes and
the second team cashes, they get full paints, and so on.

s:

If my partner either passes or repeats a clue and I guess the ward,
should he get any credit?

Yet you can never give paints only for gues-

Sing or only for clue-giving.

Hence, shall we call this an inherent

drawback Qf the system?

C:

All systems have drawbacks, but yes, you could call this an inherent
drawback.

But in the method we used, all the stalwarts who had proved

themselves earlier got through to the finalS.
S:

But hadn't these guys proved their mettle in the old system? What happened to the 'true t

experts?

There were also many 'proven' guys who didn't get through.
