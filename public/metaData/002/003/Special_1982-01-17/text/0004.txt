St. Jr,seph's, Trichy 6Lt (Kathiresan 18, Vincent 17, James 12)
Podar,

What happene~ t~ St. J~seph's Trichy?
This highly fancied
side; was a mere paper tige;r this m'lrning.
Did last night's encounter II'Jith IIT(M) and the nail-biting finish drain Qut their
physic~l and mental resources?
Or were they demor~lise;r:l by their
lnss?
Perhaps ~t was the absence of their coach Mr. Kasi that made
all tho difference l.n their 13st two matches.
(Mr. Kasi rushed back
tc Trichy a couple of days back due to his brother's demise.)
On the o'ther hand, the Bombay University champs looked a much
imfJroved si.-Je.
They fiel-led RamabhcJ-Jraa who f2.ew in from Bombay
on Friday nl.ght.
I~t half time they led 4Lt-26.
PDoar was well and
truly in the dr~v8r's seat with a lead of 72-47 late into the; seconrJ
half, and St. Jose;nh's ~nuld not bridge the gap.
