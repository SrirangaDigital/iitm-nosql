the Loyola goal came just a minute before the long whistle.

The synthetic

ball slipped out of Pai's hands and was pushed in again for the lone goal.
Loyola went on to win the finals 4-n.

Sirs,
In your report about the postponed Ganga-Tapti tennis match (SPEClATOR dated 12 february 1982) it has been wrongly mentioned that no one
from Ganga turned up.

The match was scheduled to start at 4.45 p.m. and

at t hat time the Ganga tennis team was very much present on the court.
It was the Tapti team that hadn't turned up.
