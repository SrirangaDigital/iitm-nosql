BMS VS PSG

BMS COLLFGE WhlCh went down fightlmg yesterday rut ur a sim118r
fight tnday, though not ~uitF to th~ same extent ns with Loyola.
But one cannot blame thpm. ThE' PSG juggernaut bulldnzpd through
the BMS df'frnc'" ruthlessly. SUrE'sh Bauu, rut ur A spirited performance
when hie team was ir deE'r waters, And h('1d some success but waS not8ble
to break the strong PSG defence. The final score of 103-76 does
not do justice to the spirit of EMS in gcner~l. and Suresh in
rarticular.
