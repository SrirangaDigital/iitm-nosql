Normally, it is a straight trade off between

hostels but this year a few hostels are in the field and a

fortnight

fro~

now one of these hostels will reverberate with the

sounds of joy, the sound of victory.
The Schroeter scene has become so intense, so thick,
so intricate that Cauvery, a

~uahover

making a strong bid - so much so that their cheering squads nearly
match those of Jamuna.
