EVENTS

Mardi Gr3.s is having its second taste of these
events.

'Ihis year ~ it is being organised on a much

larger scale than last time.

In fact, i f you see a

crowd you can be sure that the infonnal events arc
• in form'.

'!he emphasis is, ostensibly I on people

coming together and not competition.

However things

are turning out to be real formal, and teams were even
seen practicmg for tomorrows games yesterday.
The events should be announced in advance but the
orgunisers should form the t8~S by drawing lots
in situ. Only then will things be tinformQl' in the
real sense of the term.
But meanwhile, the show must go on and its gain'
fine.

Good show • INFORM."\L MEN I
