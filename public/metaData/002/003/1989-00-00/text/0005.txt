The rpsponS8 6bt~ined for f{,e deg~ee of c~nfidence' ~f the respondents'
choice of the cAndid~te (ie. the prob~bility of his choice winning
the election) is:
47.D5~ "'re FlbsoluteSiy sure of their choicest vIctory_
45.87% are reeson~bly SUre.
7.06% do not think th=ot their c~ndidAte would win.

Another popul-r belief is th~t , r8rsoh, however well you know

e) None of the ~bove.

The results for the nbove question throw up ~n ~ttitude of independence ~s f~r ~s the ch~nsing of c,ndidAte is cmncerned. (Alternative

SUrprising ~s -11 the
~elev8nt cboices h~ve been t~ken into
~ccount.
Choices 'a' and 'b' have 31 .1~ and 30.6~ support
respectively. As t~is forms A lArge chunk of the electorate,
it can be Lnfe~red that atout 6~ cf the populations' vote depends
on either the points made in thp manifesto Or how well known
the contestant is. The resrnndents nlso se;; not particularly influenced by e c~ndidate slo]ging mOre thpn the others.( As only
19.3% opted for this choice)
As it is obVious from the statistics, the numbe~ of 'undecided'
is st~ggering fer both HAS and Gen Sec. So it w~uld not b~ w~ong to
predict that this large chumk Can sw~y the election any way.
50 much for th~ rpsults. These results indicnte the trend around
the wPFkend. They donot indicate swing with time. These only
the final elections~tell us.
