dull game.
Yesterday all Cauvery's troubl~s seemed so fur Jway,
But today it looked as though
They were here to stay
oh ~ wouldn't Cauvery have loved to believe in YesterdQY
only Yesterday !
Sithu's absence due to injury took the sting out of
the Ganga attack.

Javed and Pathak played their hearts out.

Cauvery enjoyed territorial supremacy thro'the match but the
tenaci ty of l? athak under the bar and the ever watchful J uved
kept than at bay.

Ganga full back Santhosam almost handed over

the match on a platter to Cauvery when he decided to â€¢ hand'
the ball over to Pathak -

all in the dee.

The penalty kick

that v;as tended over ,vas shot straight into i?athak by DavJson
and \,'lith it CQuvery had blown their best chance.
could not lJroduce unything.

Dnwson' s kick was a carbon copy of his earlier goof I

Bon.dha shot out

whereas ,,'\nilcsh made it 2-0 and seLlIed Cauvery' s fate.

It never touched the -height of a final.

The vvinners had the

better shure of exchanges and the Ganga forwards could muke
