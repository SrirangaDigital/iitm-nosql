Hi fclks!
We eire back ag~'lin!
At ins outSE't, we wish our ~£3adprs ~ veT'y h:=tpry
and a pro~rerous new ye~r.
~ treat for the connoiseur is on the
CuI front and fot' the sports buff on thp Srorts front in the form of
MG and GF -KR ~es pectively is in thE' of fing. BeforE' coming to this
sem's E'vents(there have be~n no events so far) there is a kutty
flAsh bRck on the I ntE'r lIT mE'E't '88 fot' the bpnefit of those who
missed i~-IntE'r lIT waS great fun.
ThE' GC w~s of cOUrse OU't'S.
One
snlient point to be highlighted is thE' enthu cheering for the Basket
Enll matches, esre ially the finals, the likes of which have not b~rn
SEen before. We hare that this trend continuE's in the forthcoming
GF-KR tooL

About GF-KR, due to lAck of proper publicity, junta does not evpn know
th~t the event is to take rlAcc beeween fourth and eighth of this month.
We h~ar that only one stotion wampn's t~~m is pxrected comrared to
lAst year's threF' MCC hflve ditche:!"
This time MG 89 is all set to tClke off on the' 12th of J An with the
good oJ..c. cL~sses in the morning continuing as usual. (About afternoon
c18sses-wr knDw not.) This not withstanding, we hope that MG turns
out to be A gr::lnd succoss.
