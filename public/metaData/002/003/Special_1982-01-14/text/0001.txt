Another day of exciting baskotball,
the spectatnrs are having a good time
(no pun intended), but the same cannot

To their dis-

may, two more teams have withdrawn from
the tourney - TNAU CoimbAtore after confirming their participation and REC Calicut
who showed quite some interest earlier.
With this Pool B should be

A

casual affair

fo r National.
The organisers are planning to field
an lIT 'B' t8am in Pool B.

Podar College,

Bombay helped the organisers out by playing an exhibition match when MMC gave a
walk over to lIT(M}.

Thanks a lot,

Pcd~r,

for this very sporting gesture.
