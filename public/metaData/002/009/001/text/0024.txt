The division of labour agreed on, by which the Federal Government was
for the greater part to undertake the equipment of the laboratories and workshops with machines, apparatus and material for theoretical and practical teach—
ing, as well as send a number of professors and Instructors, has proved success—
ful. A form of co—operation has been carried out here which may serve as an
example of good partnership on a basxs of equality. In addition to training in
their special subjects, the students have before them daily an object lesson on
how two nations, which in their history, traditions and habits of life have developed very differently, can collaborate well and successfully to achieve a
high aim.
The aim to be served by the Institute of Technology in Madras can be
described most succmctly in the words of the great lodestar of Indian youth.
Mahatma Gandhi :
‘ Knowledge will be the common property of the people.’
The stone which I now have the honour to lay should be a constant reminder
of this task to us and to all who teach and study in this Institute.
I wish from my heart that the Institute of Technology in Madras may be
successful in its further development. May it work for the welfare of the Indian
nation and contribute to a ﬂourishing friendship between Germany and India.
