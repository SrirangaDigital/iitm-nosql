modate 192 boys. Four more hostels are still to be constructed to complete the
full complement of the hostels for the ultimate requirements of the Institute.
The hostels are all single-seated. The ﬁrst two hostels that were constructed were of the open type (Fig. 7) which had its own advantages and disadvantages.
The area provided in the ﬁrst two hostels is 118 sq.ft. carpet area per boy (including balcony) and an overall area of 283 sq.ft. per boy including dining hall,
kitchen, common-room etc. The cost per student in hostels No. 1 and 2 worked
out to Rs. 5,450 exclusive of furniture.
As this cost and design was found to be costly the design of the present
hostels has been amended to provide accommodation in a single-seat room for each
boy of 82.5 sq.ft. in the room and in the overall 216 sq.ft. This has reduced
the overall cost per boy in the hostels to Rs. 4,160. The design of the new
hostels is of the quadrangle type (Fig. 8) with the kitchen on one end and the
common-room at the other end of the quadrangle. The rooms are all facing south
so that full and free ventilation is assured for each of the rooms.
