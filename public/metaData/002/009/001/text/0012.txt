The Indian Institute of Technology at Guindy,
Madras, is one of the four institutes of higher tech—
nological education inaugurated by the Government
of India, and started functioning in 1959. The
Institute has had the kind co-operation and assistance of the Federal Government of Germany and
owes a good deal of its rapid development to the
interest evinced by the West German Government.
The visit of His Excellency the President of the
Federal Republic of Germany was of great signiﬁcance and it helped to bring closer together the
ties of friendship and mutual co—operation between
the two Governments. Having been associated
from the beginning with the planning, the con—
struction and the development of this Institute in
particular, I should pay my tribute to the Director
and his staff and to the Engineering Section for the

valuable work that they have done. I am sure
that this Institute will, ere long, function as a great
centre for post-graduate education in the ﬁeld of
engineering and technology. I trust that this will
be a lasting memorial to the spirit of friendship
and co-operation evinced by the two Governments.
