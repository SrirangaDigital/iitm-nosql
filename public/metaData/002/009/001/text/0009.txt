Today is a landmark in the development of relations between our two peoples in the scientiﬁc and
cultural sphere. On this day, on the occasion of
the State visit of the Pre51dent of the Federal
Republic of Germany a memorial tablet will be
unveiled, testifying to coming generations the
mutually constructive work of our two peoples.
On this memorable day I would like to express my
heartiest congratulations. May this educational
institution contribute towards training the engineers, so urgently required for the economic development of your country. Even though pleasure on
this signiﬁcant day is dimmed by the events in the
North of your country, be assured that during these
critical hours, the Federal Republic of Germany,
as India’s friend, shares her troubles and needs.
To the Board of the Institute of Technology, its
Indian and German professors, to its lecturers and

staﬂ members as well as to all its students I would
like to send my best wishes for future mutual work‘
