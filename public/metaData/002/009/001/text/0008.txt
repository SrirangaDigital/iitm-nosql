The visit of the President of the Federal Republic
of Germany to your country takes place at a time
when the Indian Institute of Technology nears its

completion. Indian and German professors, lecturers and technicians have been working together
for several years at this Institute to give the coming
Indian generation that knowledge which will enable

it to build up and supervise production centres.
The co-operation between our two peoples in
the sphere of scientiﬁc-technical education evolved
at the Indian Institute of Technology should also
be an example for our future endeavours whenever
it is a question of contributing to the economic
development of other nations by promoting technical knowledge and experience. I herewith transmit to the Indian Institute of Technology my
sincerest congratulations for this day.

May this

Institute provide many young Indians with the
technical as well as the intellectual knowledge in—
dispensable to solving the great developmental
tasks of the country.
PROF. LUDWIG ERHARD
Minister of Economics

Federal Republic of Germany
