It is a special pleasure for me to transmit my
congratulations to the Indian Institute of Technology at Madras for today’s ceremonies. In 1956, on
the occasion of the visit of Prime Minister Nehru
to the Federal Republic, an agreement was reached
between us for the foundation of this Institute.
Unfortunately, the ceremony today is overshadowed
by the events on India’s Northern frontier. I hope
that these differences may soon be satisfactorily
settled and so do the German people whose sympathies are with the Indian people. May the students
and staff be given the opportunity to pursue peacefully those tasks which our two Governments set
themselves in founding this Institute. I wish with
all my heart that the Institute of Technology may
become a symbol for the friendly relations between
our two peoples.
