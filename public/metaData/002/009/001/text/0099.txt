Department he became in 1932. From 1930 to
1936, he did research on plasma and hot cathode
emission and worked on thyratron development.
From 1936 to 1945 his work covered semiconductor research and development of selenium
rectiﬁers and basic research in control of
barrier layers. From 1942 onwards, he was
Head of the above department. From 1946 to
1958, he was Head of semi-conductor research
of ABC at Belecke (Moehne), as during this
period the ‘AEG-Forschungsinstitut’, Berlin
could not continue its work. Dr. Koch’s work
at Belecke comprised selenium, germanium,
and silicon research and development.
Dr. Koch, Professor of Physics, visited
Sweden (1948), England (1947 and 1950) and the USA (1952) on a study tour
before joining I.I.T. Madras on July 3rd, 1959.
