Today, at the unveiling of this memorial tablet
at the Indian Institute of Technology on the
occasion of the visit of the President of the Federal
Republic of Germany, the erection of this educational establishment is almost completed. This
Institute, built by our Indian friends with the contribution of the Federal Republic, is of specral
importance.

It has been established in a state

which is not only concerned with pointing out its
own problems and solving them, but which also,

in spite of the great tasks awaiting in her own
country, gives a shining example by delegating
experts for work in other developing countries.
Thus, through the initiative and application of the
Indian students, the work of this Institute—the

largest project promoted by the Federal Republic
of Germany within the frame—work of technical
collaboration—will not only contribute to the deve-

lopment of one, but of many countries. It is
therefore a special pleasure for me to transmit to
the Indian Institute of Technology my best wishes
for the future.
