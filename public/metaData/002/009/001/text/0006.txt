I am glad to know that H.E. Drr Heinrich Luebke,

President of the Federal Republic of Germany, will
lay the foundation stone of the Indian Institute of
Technology on 3rd December.

We are sincerely

grateful to the German Federal Republic for their
invaluable assistance in establishing this Institute.
Association with the German people in the great
work of economic development of our country must
be a source of inspiration for us. In spite of the
unspeakable destruction as a result of the last war,
they were able to build up their country within
a very short time, and make it one of the most
advanced countries of the world. I hope those who
are connected with the Institute will follow their
example and will strive their utmost, with intelligent,
honest and hard work to harness all that modern
technology has to offer to the welfare of our people.
I wish your function success.
DR. ZAKIR HUSSAIN

Vice-President of India
