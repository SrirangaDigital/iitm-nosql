The reading of history, sociology and literature, the capacity for a right
appreciation of the Fine Arts like Poetry, Drama, Music, Sculpture, Painting
and Architecture, and the study of International Relations are rewarding
experiences. What pleasure there is in reading some of the great classics of the
world~the plays of Shakespeare, the poems of Milton and others, and the masterpieces of Kalidasa! They plumb the innermost recesses of the human heart.
\Vhat thrill is experienced when one listens to the inspired compositions of some
great musician (Beethoven, Wagner, Theagaraja) or stands before the Taj Mahal
at Agra or St. Peter's Church at Rome ! How entrancingly beautiful are some of
the great masterpieces in painting or sculpture I How the student of history
stands dazzled when he studies the progress achieved by mankind through the
centuries, in spite of all the wars and battles, intrigues and failures, and the various
acts of human folly and human crimes 1 How much the study of Economics
means to the individual and to the community in this complex modern world I
And how fascinating it becomes when expounded by an inspired teacher ! How
we experience a widening of our mental horizon when we read the great books
written in other languages by some of their accredited leaders of thought—whether
in the ﬁeld of Arts or in the ﬁeld of Science !
