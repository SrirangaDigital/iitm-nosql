The Indian Institute of Technology, Madras is the third in the chain of
the four Higher Technological Institutes set up by the Government of India.
This Institute has been set up with the aid of
the Government of the Federal Republic of
Germany in the matter of equipment to the
extent of 16 million Deutschmarks (approximately Rs. 1.80 crores) and 20 Professors and 5
Workshop Foremen for a period of ﬁve years. Of
the three other Institutes, Kharagpur and

situated adjacent to the Raj Bhavan Estate and a
total area of nearly 630 acres of land has been
made available for the construction of the Institute campus, major portion of the area being carved out from the Raj Bhavan
Estate and some portions in the neighbouring areas of Taramani, Pallipattu and
Kanagam villages being acquired for the speciﬁc purpose of the Institute.

Raj Bhavan Estate it is a fairly wooded area and has a good drainage. In the
lay-out of the campus efforts have been made not to disturb the existing drainage and also to retain as many of the trees as possible to provide a natural surrounding for the entire campus.
The lay-out of the campus has been prepared by the then School of Town
and Country Planning, New Delhi, now called the School of Town Planning and
Architecture and can broadly be divided into four distinct sectors (see plan

Hostel Sector and the Recreational Sector.
