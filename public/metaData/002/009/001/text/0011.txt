I am very glad to know that the foundation stone
of the Indian Institute of Technology, Madras, will
be laid by His Excellency the President of the
Federal Republic of Germany on the 3rd December,
1962. On this happy occasion, I send my greetings
and good wishes to the management, the staff and
the students.
The Indian Institute of Technology, Madras, is
one of the four Higher Technological Institutes
set up by the Government of India to meet the
requirements of high grade engineers and technologists. Engineers and technologists are necessary
for the successful implementation of the schemes of
industrialization that are being taken up. The
Institute is particularly fortunate in securing the
collaboration of West Germany, one of the most
highly industrially developed countries in the world
today.
Our thanks are due to the Government of the
Federal Republic of Germany for the very valuable
assistance offered for the establishment of this
Institute. The Institute has entered its fourth year
of existence and it has shown remarkable progress
since its inception. I understand the entire project
costing about 8 crores of rupees will be completed
by 1965-66.
I wish the Indian Institute of Technology all
success.
BISHNURAM MEDHI
Governor of Madras
