Natarajan, and to all the members of the staff my sincere thanks and appreciation
for their very devoted serVices in the development of this Institute. The building
programme would not have been possible of execution but for the indefatigable
labours of the Superintending Engineer, Mr. Ramaswamy, and his colleagues.
I am happy to bear testimony to the fact that a Sincere spirit of co-operation
and a keen desire to make this Institute one of the best of its kind is the key-note
of everyone attached to this Institute. I hope and trust that this Institute will
prove to be a model of its kind which will bring credit not only to this country
but to the sponsoring country, the Federal Republic of Germany, which has the
reputation of being among the foremost countries in technical education.
Once more, may I convey to Your Excellencies and your colleagues a hearty
welcome and our sincere gratitude for the trouble you have taken in going over to
this country and inspiring us with your presence.
