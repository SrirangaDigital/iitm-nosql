PROF. R. KRISJINAMURTX, M.A.
Head of the Department of Humanitier
The need for teaching some Humanities subjects in Professional Colleges
and Technological Institutes has been urged by almost every person who has
bestowed any thought on the subject. In the
Indian Institute of Technology, Madras, every
undergraduate student has to study some langu—
ages and some social science subjects. The
study of the Humanities extends over all the ﬁve
years of the course.
The Indian Institute of Technology, Madras,
started functioning in July 1959: and a Courses
Committee set about preparing the scheme of
studies for the undergraduates. A special
Committee called the Humanities Advisory
Committee was constituted with the Director
of the Institute as the Chairman, and a num—

ber of experts as its members. The following
were the members of the Committee:
Professor B. Sengupto.
Professor C. V. Krishna Rao.
Professor Rt Balalcrishna.

Professor A. L. Krishnan.

The Committee went into the whole question in great detail at more than one
sitting, and arrived at certain conclusions. They had with them for their guidance
the course of studies in Humanities in the Massachusetts Institute of Technology,
the University of Michigan, the University of Madras, and the Indian Institute of
Technology, Kharagpur.
The following was the scheme recommended for the I.I.T., Madras, by the
Humanities Advisory Committee :
I Year
