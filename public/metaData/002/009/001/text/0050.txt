control and last but not least repeated personal contacts which are the basis of
lasting business relationship, have to receive serious attention.
Some time ago the Federal Republic of Germany made available to India,
the services of three experts to advise India on general export promotion, Several
recommendations were made. Following the suggestion of experts, a Trade
Centre was set up in Frankfurt to promote export to Germany by direct contacts
between Indian and German businessmen and by providing regular information
to Indian industry about the German market, bringing to its notice any items
important for India’s exports.
The work of the Indo-German Chamber of Commerce over the past six years
both in India and Germany deserves specral mention. It 1s a new type
of Chamber of Commerce for India where ‘ bipartite ' organisations are not
known. The Chamber took up practical work in March 1956 and has prepared
the ground for effective Indo—German partnership dispensrng advice on and promoting trade and co-operation schemes. The Chamber is in close touch with all
levels of the central Administration in matters affecting Indo-German trade and
industrial relations.
In conclusion may I remark that, whatever he the sphere of activity which
brings Germans and Indians together, their joint contributions are based on
respect for each other, friendship and generous goodwill.
In the years to come, there13 little doubt that this peaceful team-work will
grow at an increased tempo—cementing old friendships and contributing to
the evolution by peaceful means of a democratic nation, a staunch friendin the
free world.
