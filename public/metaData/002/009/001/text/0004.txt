That the Federal President, Dr. Heinrich Luebke

will also visit the Indian Institute of Technology at
Madras while in India, gives me real pleasure, as I
have only the most pleasant and grateful memories

of my visit there. The collaboration of German
and Indian Professors there seems to me to have
built up an institution which should certainly
bring

about a development and revival of the

technical abilities of the Indian people. You have
my best wishes.
DR. THEODOR HEUSS
Former President
