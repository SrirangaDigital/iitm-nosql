to be found in Paul Deussen’s Allgemeine Gesrhithle der Philosophie (General History of Philosophy, 1894-1908) already mentioned above. Paul Deussen
(1845-1919) who actually was not an indologist proper but Professor of Philosophy
at Kiel University, accepted nevertheless, without any reserve by even the most
inveterate indologists (which deserves special mention), also published a ﬁrst
complete German translation of Batlarayana‘s Brahmasulmr with Sankara's
commentary, and of sixty Upmzislzmlr (Seeks/g Upmiishad'r der Veda, 1897‘).
His System ties Vedanta (System of the Vedanta, 1883) based upon the
Bralmmmlrar, is still most valuable to the German student of Advaita philosophy despite the fact that being a strict follower of Schopenhauer, Paul Deussen
arrived at many an incorrect conclusion.
Based upon Boehtlingk‘s edition of Panini's Asthadhyayi are the Sanskrit
primers by \Vilhelm Geiger (1856-1943) and Adolf Stenzler, the latter's book
still being the ﬁrst a young German indologist has to plunge into, and, last but
not least, the most extensive of all works on Indian grammar written in German,

the Altindz'sthe Gmmmatik (Ancient Indian Grammar) by the two Swiss
linguists Jakob \Vackernagel (1853-1938) and Albert Debrunner.
\Vilhclm Geiger was also the author of Pali, Lilemtur zmd Sprache (Pali,
Literature and Language, 1916), while a grammar of the various Prakrits was
published by Richard Pisehel (1849-1908) (Grammatik der Prakritsprathen,
1900).
Some of the works mentioned above form part of the Grundrirr der indoa<
rischen Philologie und Altertumxkunde (Compendium of Indo—Arian Philology
and Archaeology’, founded in 1896 by Georg Buehler (1837438) who, incidentally, was for quite some time professor at Bombay University at the same time
holding the post of Inspector of Schools for the Northern District of Bombay.
This compendium, later on continued by the grammarian and epigraphist Franz
Kielhorn, by Jakob Wackemagel and Heinrich Lueders (1869-1943), an encyclopaedic work of now twenty volumes, was meant to give a comprehensive introduction to the Various ﬁelds of indological research including besides those in
the languages of India, studies in ancient Indian medicine, mathematics and
astronomy, lexicography and law, to name but a few.
The philosophy of the classical systems of the Samkhya and Yoga were the
subject of the research of Richard Garbe (1857-1927), whereas Hermann Jacobi
(1850—1937) worked on the literature of the Jainas. The religion of the Veda
was extensively treated by Hermann Oldenberg (1854-1920) who also published
Die Lehre der Upanishaden umz' die Anfaenge dex Buddhixmux (The Doctrine
of the Upanishads and the Beginnings of Buddhism, 1915) and Zur Gesthz'thte
der Altindixchen Prom (On the History of Ancient Indian Prose).
