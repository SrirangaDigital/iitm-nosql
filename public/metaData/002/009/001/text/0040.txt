34.. Even though construction of the institutional building was in progress,
the programme of training undergraduate students was gomg on as per schedule,
though the number of students admitted had to be restricted to 121 in 1959-60,
138 in Igéo-éi, 180 in r961—62 and zio in i962-63. Every square foot of
space which the contractors could make available was occupied. Lectures and
laboratory classes were conducted on the ground ﬂoor while the work was still
going on in the ﬁrst and second ﬂoors. The endurance and patience of the
staff and the students were tried to the limit. Makeshift laboratories were
rigged up for the most essential undergraduate work. It has been a trying
experience, bUt everyone concerned has faced it with fortitude and forbearance.
There was, however, one obligation, which the Institute could not
fulﬁl, at the beginning. The Institute, which was meant prinCipally to be a
post-graduate and research institution, could not enter this phase of activity.
