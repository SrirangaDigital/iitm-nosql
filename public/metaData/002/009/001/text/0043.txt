GERMANY AND INDIA
Cultural and Economic Relations between the two Countries

by
GERHARD FISCHER
Consul for Germany in South India

This title would be more appropriate for a book—in fact a rather thick
book. In this article I shall merely sketch in outline the numerous contributions
of the German and Indian people to one another.
Cultural Relation:
Cultural ties have existed between Germany and India for three or four
centuries. The historical background can be traced from the time of the compilation of a Sanskrit grammar by scholarly
German missionaries who visited India. The
names of Goethe, the brothers Schlegel, Schopenhauer, Max Muller, Deussen, Geldner and
many others are indissolubly linked up with
Indian classical literature and philosophy. These
scholars developed a deep interest in India which
stemmed from the scholars before their times
who had been making a continuous search for
the country of the origin of the human language
and culture—a country believed to be the
‘ Orient ’ by which they meant INDIA. Wilhelm
von Humboldt, the philologist, poet and diplomat, was enchanted by the Bhagavad Gita
which he studied after learning Sanskrit from
Franz Bopp. Humboldt’s abiding interest in
Indian philosophy, his studies and preferences had many practical consequences
—the most important one was the reforming of the German Universities which
was mainly his work, the work of a man so deeply inﬂuenced by Indian
philosophy.
Among these German indologists Max Mﬁller holds a unique position.
Havmg grown up in the romantic tradition of his period he became one of the
greatest interpreters of Indian thought. His treatise on the Rig-Veda is conSidered invaluable by scholars both in India and abroad.
