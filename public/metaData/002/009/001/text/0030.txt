of equipment was made available by different participating countries for postgraduate training and research, and it must be said, in all fairness, that the assrstance has, to a cons1derable extent, been responsible for the establishment of post-

graduate departments at the Indian Institute of Technology, Kharagpur.
6. It was in this context that the Government of India thought it proper to
seek for and accept any proposal of collaboration from the technologically advanced
countries in the matter of setting up these institutions. The offer of such an
assmtance was not also lacking and it was, therefore, possible in the case of institutes started subsequently to try an experiment to eliminate difﬁculties experienced
by the Kharagpur Institute. Furthermore, with such aSSistance forthcoming, it
was hoped, that it would be possible to try out different systems of technological
education prevalent in different technologically advanced countries with a View
to evolving, ultimately, a system of education which would suit our needs.
7. During the visit of our Prime Minister to West Germany in June 1956,
the Government of the Federal Republic of Germany offered technical assistance
in the form of a technological institute in India. The Prime Minister readily
accepted this gracious offer and suggested thata German Technical Mission should
visit India and see different engineering colleges, research institutions, factories,
etc., in order to get a clear View of the needs of our country, to discuss details
of the scheme with experts, educationists and Government ofﬁcials in India and

to formulate ﬁnal proposals for the establishment of the Institute.
8. Accordingly, a German Technical Mission under the leadership of the
Minister of State Professor Dr. August Ruker visited India on 24th October, 1956.
The Government of India also set up a Sponsoring Committee under the Chairmanship of the then Cabinet Secretary Mr. Y. N, Sukthankar for detailed
discussion with the German Technical Mission. The members of the Sponsoring
Committee were :
1. Mr. Y. N. Sukthankar
