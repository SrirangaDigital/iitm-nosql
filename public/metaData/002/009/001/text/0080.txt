statements and conclusions are perhaps strictly limited in validity, and strongly
coloured by my personal experience. I have purposely not expatiated on the
very hard and thorough work the Germans have been putting in all these years,
mainly because it has been written about so much and can be considered wellknown !
I wish to conclude this account of some of my experiences in W. Germany
and of a few impressions gained there with my unqualiﬁed appreciation of the
extremely friendly and helpful attitude of all the Germans—they included workers,
students, engineers and professors—with whom I was associated during a period
of nearly six years. I sometimes wonder whether we in India, on our part, are
doing all we can to help and co-operate with the German advisers, engineers,
technicians and teachers, who are trying to do a difﬁcult job in very strange
surroundings. I hope very much that as time goes on we will learn to appreciate each other’s qualities better and that an even more fruitful co-operative
effort will emerge than at present.
