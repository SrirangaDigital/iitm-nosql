I am pleased to note that the Indian Institute of
Technology, Madras, which was established only

3 years ago, has made rapid progress in the achievement of the purpose for which it was started. The
need for such an Institute is all the greater now

when the situation in the country demands the
extension of programmes for training of technical
personnel.

I am glad that the foundation stone of

this Institute is being laid by our distinguished
guest, the President of the Federal Republic of
Germany,

Dr. Heinrich Luebke.

I wish the

Institute all success.
SHRI JAWAHARLAL NEHRU
Prime Minister of India
