27
years, been transformed from a forbidding forest to a homely haven, without
pulling down the cool cathedral of greenery all round. The credit for this must
surely go to our architects and our Engineering Unit. They have truly imbibed
the spirit of our Prime Minister’s dictum that ‘ cutting down a tree is murder’.
The Engineering Unit have worked night and day to construct and complete
this pretty open-air theatre in an incredibly small span of two months. To them,
my thanks are specially due.
I must also thank Dr. Kraus, my staff colleagues, both German and Indian,
as also my students for all their co-operation in ensuring so successful an evening.
To one and all of you, distinguished ladies and gentlemen, I offer my grateful thanks for coming over and making this a function to remember.
