When I remember the dreams of my childhood about paradise, I would like
to localisc it now, after having seen the landscape of Kerala in its intricate
interplay of land and water, the backwaters, where all around the fertility of Nature
is symboliscd by the fruit-bearing coconut trees, though, I know too well that

behind all this lovely scenery, the problems of overpopulation have already
destroyed the paradisaic character.
At the end, I have no hesitation to confess I shall never miss my impressions

in India which have enriched me so much.
