I am happy to know that the President of the
Federal Republic of Germany, who is our honoured
guest in India, is laying the foundation stone of the
Indian Institute of Technology in Madras. The
establishment of this Institute has been made possible by the generous ﬁnancial and other assistance
of the Federal German Republic. It is a visible
demonstration of German friendship for India and
I have no doubt that our young men will proﬁt by
the guidance of German teachers in collaboration
with their Indian colleagues. My best wishes for
the success and continued development of the
Institute.
DR. S. RADHAKRISHNAN

President of India
