    "Description": "A special event was held at the Institute’s Open Air Theatre (1968) in honour of Prof. B. Sengupto, the first Director of IIT Madras. The event consisted of the unveiling of a life size portrait (of the former director) and a series of speeches given by the dignitaries who were present at the event. The painting graced the Building Sciences Block (which was known as the admin building at that time) and later the Department of Management Studies (previously known as Central Library) before being brought to the Institute’s Heritage Centre where it can still be found today."
