    "Description": "A life size portrait of Prof. B. Sengupto, the first Director of IIT Madras was created and unveiled in honour of his instrumental and manifold efforts to set up the Institution at a special event that was held at the Institute’s Open Air Theatre. The painting graced the Building Sciences Block (which was known as the admin building at that time) and later the Department of Management Studies (previously known as Central Library) before being brought to the Institute’s Heritage Centre where it can still be found today. The Chief Guest for the special event held in 1968 was Prof. Maneklal Sankalchand Thacker, an Indian power engineer, academic and the director general of the Council of Scientific and Industrial Research, the largest research and development organization in India. In the image Dr. A. L. Mudaliar (Chairman, Board of Governors) felicitates the artist (as identified by Mrs. Gourishankar, wife of the photographer) with a shawl. Also seen on the dais from the left: Prof. R. K. Gupta (HOD, Humanities and Social Sciences), an individual who is yet to be identified (possibly the portrait artist), Dr. A. L. Mudaliar (Chairman, Board of Governors) and  Prof. A. Ramachandran (Director)"
