Sengupto, the first Director of IIT Madras was created and unveiled in honour of his instrumental and manifold efforts to set up the Institution at a special event that was held at the Institute’s Open Air Theatre. The chief guest for the event was Prof. Maneklal Sankalchand Thacker, an Indian power engineer, academic and the director general of the Council of Scientific and Industrial Research, the largest research and development organization in India. In the image, Prof. M. S. Thacker unveils the painting of Prof. B. Sengupto. Also present on the dais, from the left: Dr. A. L. Mudaliar, Prof. A. Ramachandran, Prof. S. Sampath. The painting graced the Building Sciences Block (which was known as the admin building at that time) and later the Department of Management Studies (previously known as Central Library) before being brought to the Institute’s Heritage Centre where it can still be found today."
