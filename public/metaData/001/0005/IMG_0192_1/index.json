    "Description": "On 30th January, 1964 Mr. Hans Lenz (Minister for Scientific Research, Federal Republic of Germany, Bonn) visited IIT Madras. A high tea ceremony was thrown in honour of his visit to the campus. Mr. Hans Lenz was received in front of the Building Sciences Block by Prof. Sengupto (Director) and other administration officials of the Institution. In the image, Mr. Hans Lenz (seated in the front of the car) arrives at the IIT Madras campus. It is very possible that he was suffering a walking impairment due to the two walking sticks that can be seen in the car near him. Furthermore a photograph taken on December 13th, 1962 when he was appointed as Minister of Research shows him using the assistance of two walking sticks. This image can be found on Wikipedia. Hence, it is quite possible that he had to be received in this manner. The gentlemen standing in the image, from the left are: Mr Dubey (Secretary to the Registrar), Mr. R. Natarajan (Registrar), Prof. B. Sengupto (Director) Mr. Y. S. Ramaswamy (Superintending Engineer) and Prof. R. A. Kraus (Adviser to the Government of India for IIT Madras). The two gentlemen standing at the back of the reception party are yet to be identified."
