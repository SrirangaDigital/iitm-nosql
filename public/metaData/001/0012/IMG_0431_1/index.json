The Institute Day of IIT Madras is a day marked to celebrate and recognize the hard work and success of people who have shown excellence in academics as well as extracurricular activities. Hence, it was also called Gymkhana Day or Annual Day. After the conferment of prizes, a series of entertainment programmes were presented to commemorate the ceremony. The students and faculty members performed musical pieces and dramatics for the audience. In the image, the students perform a musical piece on the Third Institute Day.
