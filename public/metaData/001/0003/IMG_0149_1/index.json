In his address, Dr. Heinrich Luebke stressed on the success that was born out of the co-operation between the two countries and their governments. He quoted a line by Mahatma Gandhi &#39;Knowledge will be the common property of the people&#39;, and went on to say that &#34;The stone which I now have the honour to lay should be a constant reminder of this task to us and to all who teach and study in this Institute.&#34;"
