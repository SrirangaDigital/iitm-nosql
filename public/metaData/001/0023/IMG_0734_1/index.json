    "Description": "The chief guest at IIT Madras’s sixth convocation was Dr. S. Bhagavantam, Scientific Advisor to the Ministry of Defence, Government of India. On the day of the event, upon reaching the campus, Dr. S. Bhagavantam was received by Prof. A. Ramachandran, Director of the Institute and Mr. C. V. Sethunathan, Registrar. After the event (possibly), the chief guest was shown around the Institute and was invited to view the labs and workshop facilities. In the image, Dr. S. Bhagavantam examines the German “Small Computer”. That year the Electrical Engineering Department received two computers, almost certainly the first computers on campus. One computer was quite large while the other, seen in the image, was much smaller. This “Small Computer” was a German computer that was built about a decade after the larger one. This computer was an example at that time of how modern electronics aids in the miniaturization of instruments, resulting in products which consume lesser power and which, more often than not, exhibit greater efficiency.
