    "Description": "The Governor’s Prize was awarded for all-round proficiency in the B. Tech. degree course. In the ‘Caricature’ column of Campastimes (Vol. VI, No. 6), M. K. writes that George Verghese was a sports and adventure enthusiast. M. K. writes, “On his (Verghese’s) first outing in the Himalayas, he did so well that he was judged best in his group. The next time together with Jarikumar, he made headlines when they climbed Mt. Shila- a hitherto unconquered peak”. Along with a team of students, Verghese climbed the 20,000+ foot peak in 1966. The average age of the students, according to an article in the Deccan Chronicle, was 22. The article was titled “Madras Students Scale Mt. Shilla”. In the picture given above, we can see a number of photographers. As the number of graduands and audience grew through the years (as is evident from the records of photographic albums), it became a necessity for the institute to hire more photographers for important events, such as the convocation. The cameraman behind George Verghese seems to be using either a Yashica or Rolleiflex twin-lens reflex camera (TLR). The TLR cameras, as opposed to the SLR (single-lens reflex) cameras were less bulky and mechanically simple. The cameraman to the extreme left in the photograph seems to be using either an SLR or rangefinder camera."
