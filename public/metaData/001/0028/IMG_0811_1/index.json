    "Description": "Prof. A. Ramachandran, Director, and Mr. C. V. Sethunathan, Registrar, welcoming the chief guest Dr. Vikram A. Sarabhai. At the time, Sarabhai was Chairman of the Atomic Energy Commission of India. In the September 1968 edition of Campastimes, the interview with Dr. Sarabhai (p.5) describes how Dr. Vikram A. Sarabhai “looked like an eastern fakir contemplating the world at the end of his hookah. The long maroon-coloured sherwani and the sparkling white churridars seemed to add to his personality.” In the interview, Sarabhai talked about how science, humanities and technology must be included at the institute, stressing on the importance of the humanities."
