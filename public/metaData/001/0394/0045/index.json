    "Description": "According to Wikipedia, this moth “is endemic to tropical and subtropical areas (South Asia, Malay Archipelago, Africa), but is also found in other areas due to its migratory nature.” The wingspan is recorded at 19-22 mm. According to RGV Bug Blog, “As their name suggests, they web the top leaves and terminal portion of the plant to provide a protected location where they will feed.” In other words, the moth weaves together the leaves in order to protect itself."
