    "Description": "Notodontidae is a family of moths with over 3800 known species. According to Wikipedia, “species of this family tend to be heavy-bodied and long-winged, the wings held folded across the back of the body at rest. They rarely display any bright colours, usually being mainly grey or brown.” They are known to resemble members of the family Noctuidae, although they are not closely related."
