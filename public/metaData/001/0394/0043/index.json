    "Description": "The moth belongs to the Sphingidae family, known as sphinx moths. According to Wikipedia, they are moderate to large in size, with a wingspan of 90-122 mm. Some hawk moths are mistaken for hummingbirds owing to their habit of hovering in mid-air while feeding on nectar from flowers. According to tpittaway website, “Males can make a weak hissing sound by rubbing scales over spines at the end of the abdomen.” It also describes the larva “Full-fed 69--110mm. Pale yellow on hatching, with a large black horn. With feeding the body colour becomes more green. At this stage most growth is in length, not width.”"
