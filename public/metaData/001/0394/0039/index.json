    "Description": "The moth belongs to the Geometridae family, and was “described by Franz von Paula Schrank in 1802.” (Wikipedia). According to the Moths of India website, there are 78 Scopula species found in India: “Scopula is a cryptic genus with many species lacking a distinctive fascia on the wings. Hence, genitalia and/or barcoding are needed to separate species with certainty.”"
