    "Description": "The geometrid moths belong to the family Geometridae. Interestingly, (according to Wikipedia), “their scientific name derives from the Ancient Greek”, where ‘geo’ is derived from the Greek word for ‘the earth’, while ‘meter’ is derived from metron the word referring to ‘measure’. This name (literal translation - earth-measurer) has specifically been given owing to the fact that the larvae, ‘inchworms’, move in such a fashion that they seem to be measuring the earth. According to Wikipedia, it is a very large family, with over 23,000 species of moths described. They are found almost all around the world."
