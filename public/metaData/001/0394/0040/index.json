    "Description": "The female moth, according to Wikipedia has a wingspan of about 90-110 mm, while that of the male is 80-94 mm. The body is approximately 5 cm long. According to Pestnet website, “The moth has a feeding tube (proboscis) that is up to 25 mm long, barbed and strong enough to penetrate tough rind of fruits and to suck out the juices.” The holes that they make in fruits provide an entry point for bacteria and fungi. According to Pestnet: “The caterpillars are dark brown to black when together in large numbers, and pale yellow to green when solitary. The pupae develop in silken cocoons on leaves that they draw together. After 2-3 weeks the adults emerge, mate a few days later, and the female starts laying eggs - up to 750 - during a life of about 30 days.”"
