    "Description": "The name ‘blood vein’ stems from the fact that the adult moth has a unique reddish line that runs across its wings. Pritha Dey, a moth-biologist and post-doctoral researcher from the Indian Institute of Science, Bangalore, describes it as “a leaf mimicking moth”. According to Wikipedia, “Adults are brown or green, usually with a dark edged yellow arc across the forewing. The hindwings have an angular tornus.” The tornus is the bottom corner of an insect’s wing."
