    "Description": "According to Wikipedia, “Parasa lepida, the nettle caterpillar or blue-striped nettle grub, is a moth of the family Limacodidae”. The moth is mostly green with brown and reddish brown colours. The larva is pale-green, whitish or bright yellowish green on the dorsal side. The cocoon is purple brown. (Source: Wikipedia). Interestingly, the caterpillars have nettles which contain a substance that can irritate human skin if touched. They are known as tea moths owing to the fact that the larvae are often found in plantations with commercial crops such as tea, coffee and many others."
