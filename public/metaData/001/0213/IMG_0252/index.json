The convocation took place on a Saturday evening at the Instituteâ€™s Open Air Theater and a total of 107 students (92 B. Tech. degrees and 15 M. Sc. degrees) received their degrees. After donning the convocation robes, the academic procession (the chief guest, dignitaries, the Board of Governors, and members of the Council and Senate) made its way into the Open Air Theatre, led by Mr. R Natarajan (Registrar). The Indian Air Force band that was present at the ceremony played six bars of the national anthem upon the entry of the chief guest. This was followed by an invocation."
