    "Description": "The chief guest and speaker at the first convocation of IIT Madras was Dr. Sarvepalli Radhakrishnan (1888-1975) who is well known as the second President of India (1962-1967). Before he became president, he served as the first vice-president of India (1952-1962). He is one of the most distinguished philosophers, academics and statesman of India. His entire address at the convocation was about balance and about looking at things as a whole instead of separate entities. An example he gave is IIT Madras itself, which came into existence because of the combined efforts of the German and Indian governments. Furthermore, Dr. S. Radhakrishnan stressed that to end difficulties such as poverty, hunger, disease etc. in the country, an industrial revolution is essential. But moreover, he says that it is crucial that revolution creates individuals who aren’t just technicians but individuals who are also seers and visionaries. Towards the end of his speech he states, “..scientific or humanities or technological – It is my earnest hope that you will not fall victims to the tendency to view science and humanity as two diversified disciplines and feel that you are engaged in two different and unrelated pursuits. All truth must be regarded as one whole – whether you practice this discipline or that. Your supreme aim must be to pursue truth”."
