During his address, he profusely thanked the dignitaries and all others who played an instrumental role in the growth of the Institute. He also gave a brief report of all the amenities that were provided at the campus for the students, staff and faculties. In terms of education and instruction, he hoped that IIT Madras would be a benchmark standard to other institutions in the country as well. Dr. A. Lakshmanaswami Mudaliar (1887-1974) was a multi-faceted personality: doctor, educationist and a renowned statesman. He made a number of significant contributions to society in each of these roles. He was the longest serving Vice-Chancellor of Madras University (27 years) and the first Indian Principal of the Madras Medical College. He was knighted in the 1945 New Year Honours and awarded both the Padma Bhushan (1954) and the Padma Vibhushan (1963).
