Subbulakshmi, “Nightingale of India”, as Sarojini Naidu called her, is one of the key figures in Indian classical music. She is also a recipient of India’s highest civil honour; ‘Bharat Ratna’, which was awarded to her in 1998. By 1967, she had been awarded the Padma Bhushan in 1954 and the Sangeet Natak Akademi Award in 1956. To Natarajan’s right is his father V. Ramachandra Iyer."
