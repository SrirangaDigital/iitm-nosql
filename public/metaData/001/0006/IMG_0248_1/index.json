    "Description": "A few German professors are seen in the audience. The second Indo-German Agreement was signed in June, 1966. It strengthened the tie between the two countries in terms of technical education and development. Some of the provisions of the agreement included the addition of new laboratories, training Indian teachers and technicians in German institutions, and the visits of German professors and specialists from the Technical University, Aachen, earlier in the 1967. A number of people in the audience are wearing sunglasses. At the time, ‘cat eye’, ‘horn rimmed’ and ‘browline’ glasses were popular. The introduction of plastic as a frame material, enabled sunglasses and glasses to come into fashion, owing to the various colours in which these glasses were produced."
