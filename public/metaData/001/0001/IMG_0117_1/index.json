    "Description": "The Student Secretary Mr. Syed Abdul Aleem (face covered) and Prof. P. C. Varghese (far right) are also present. It appears as though the student receiving the prize is from IIT Karagpur, owing to the fact that the letters on his back show ‘KGP’ which is the abbreviated form of Kharagpur. IIT Kharagpur won the Inter IIT Sports Meet that year in 1964 for the third time in a row. The current champion, as of December 2020, is IIT Kharagpur. As of December 2020, IIT Madras has the most wins in the tournament with 22 wins since 1961."
