    "Description": "Nawab Mohammad Mansoor Ali Khan Siddiqui Pataudi captained the Indian cricket team from when he was 21 years of age. He was given the nickname ‘Tiger Pataudi’ owing to his exceptional fielding skills, but he claims in his autobiography, &#34;I had a tigerish propensity for crawling energetically about the floor on all fours.&#34; The captain formerly played for Winchester College, even breaking the schools earlier record for most runs in a season. Speaking of records, he was the youngest test captain to lead a cricket team. When he became captain, he was 21 years and 77 days old. He held the record for being the youngest test captain up until 2004 when Tatenda Taibu claimed the record."
