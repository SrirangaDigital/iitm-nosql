    "Description": "The Nawab of Pataudi stayed at the Institute Guest House for a span of three days. Mr. R. Natarajan, in a recent interview with Prof. Ajit Kolar recalls humorously how he had tried to persuade the Nawab to stay for two more days. The Nawab, it is said, had replied that the food that was prepared by Gopal the butler, was so good, that it would ruin his cricket career if he stayed any longer at the guest house."
