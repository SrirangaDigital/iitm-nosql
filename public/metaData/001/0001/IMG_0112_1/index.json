    "Description": "The play “The New Wing at Elsinore” was written by English playwright St. John Hankin (1869-1909) and appeared in the book Mr. Punch’s Dramatic Sequels. He was a major proponent of Edwardian &#34;New Drama&#34; along with George Bernard Shaw and John Galsworthy. The play was a sequel to William Shakespeare’s Hamlet, which Hankin thought could use an extended story."
