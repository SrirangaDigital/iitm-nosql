    "Description": "This was the first time the tournament was being held at IIT Madras. The first two were held in Bombay (1961) and Kharagpur (1963). The flag (in picture) has the logos of the IITs that participated. Although only four emblems are visible, we have reason to believe that the fifth is hidden in the fold, since five teams participated that year."
