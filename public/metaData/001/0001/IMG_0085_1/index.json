    "Description": "Tennis rackets had wooden frames in the 1960s. The size of the head was smaller compared to the current rackets. Current rackets are made from graphite or graphite composites which include materials such as titanium, kevlar or fibreglass. The student in the photograph is playing a one-handed backhand shot. In the current era, players rely more on the double-handed back hand shot, since the one-hand back hand shot requires a lot more balance and strength to counter the high bouncing topspin that have gained a footing in modern tennis over the past few decades."
