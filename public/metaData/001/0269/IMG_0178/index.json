He served as Director from 1967-1973, but remained actively connected with the Institute until 2013. Dr. A. Ramachandran was an extraordinary individual and is known for his numerous contributions, not only to the Institute but also to the country. Some of the major roles he played during his life as scientist, anthropologist, author and former under-secretary general of the United Nations Centre for Human Settlements are remembered to this day. He is especially known for his scholarship on the subjects of heat and mass transfer. Beyond the many awards attributing to his un-wavering commitment in various fields, his passion and dedication to innovation has left a profound impact on housing and sustainable urbanisation, a subject that was close to his heart.
