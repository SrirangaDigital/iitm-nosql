    "Description": "From left (seated): Mr. Hans Heinrich von Herwarth, State Secretary, Mrs. Wilhelmine Luebke, Dr. A. L. Mudaliar and Dr. h. c. Heinrich Luebke and from left (standing): Mr. Y. S. Ramaswamy and Security Officer Mr. T. N. Venkataraman (in white uniform) at the event. Mrs. Wilhelmine Luebke and Dr. Heinrich Luebke first met at a function arranged by the Sauerland Mountain Climbing Club. Wilhelmine Keuthen was a school teacher from Ramsbeck. She spoke English, French, Spanish, Italian and Russian apart from German. She was awarded several awards nationally and internationally. These awards include: Grand Cross 1st Class of the Order of Merit of the Federal Republic of West Germany (West Germany), Grand Cross of the Order of Valour (Cameroon), Honorary Recipient of the Most Exalted Order of the Crown of the Realm (Malaysia), Grand Collar of the Order of the Golden Heart (Philippines) and Dame Grand Cross of the Order of Chula Chom Klao (Thailand). Security Officer Mr. T. N. Venkataraman seems to be holding the signature book that Dr. Luebke signed earlier. However, it is doubtful that the page that is visible contains the signature of the German President."
