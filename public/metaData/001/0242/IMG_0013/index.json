He held several important roles in his career, including chief justice of the Bombay High Court and judge of the International Court of Justice. His son Iqbal Chagla calls him “a man of immense simplicity”, in an interview published on the ‘MyLaw’ channel on YouTube. A. L. Mudaliar was one of the key figures in the field of education. He was Chairman of the WHO Executive Board, President and Vice President of World Health Assemblies at different points in his career and is also known for receiving the Padma Vibhushan and Padma Bhushan awards. He was knighted in the 1945 New Year Honours. T. N. Venkataraman was from Trichy. He got an Arts Degree from there, and was an Under Officer in the U.O.T.C. Venkataraman later joined the Madras Special Armed Police, “and having had ‘always a liking for the adventurous life’, participated in, and led many merry hunts for dacoits, naxalites, and other Bad Guys”, writes Bobo in his article ‘The Security Officer’, which appeared in Campastimes (Winter 1971 – Vol. X, No. 2)."
