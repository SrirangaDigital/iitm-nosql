Chagla praised the staff and students for the well organised convocation ceremony. The car in the picture appears to be a Plymouth of the 1950s. Plymouth cars were produced and distributed by the Chrysler Corporation in the United States. They ran from 1928 up until 2001, after which the production discontinued."
