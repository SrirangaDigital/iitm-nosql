Varghese,  Head of the Civil Engineering department and Dr. G. S. Laddha. In his address, Rajagopalachari noted how IIT Madras’ method of providing practical training to its students, enables them to gain a foothold in their workspace more easily. He also said, “Boys and girls of our country should be trained from the start in using their hands and not brought up in an atmosphere of pure brain work. They must be taught to think with their hands as all craftsmen do”. Rajagopalachari stressed on the importance of pairing theoretical knowledge with practical experience. Following his speech, he congratulated all the graduates of the institute. The microphones have tags of ‘AIR’, which stands for All India Radio. It is possible that All India Radio, might have been recording the function at the time."
