    "Description": "It is possible that the photograph was taken while the dignitaries were on their way to the Open Air Theatre (OAT). Prof. B. Sengupto is seen talking to Dr. h. c. Heinrich Luebke (holding hat in hand), Registrar R. Natarajan is behind Dr. Luebke, and Mrs. Wilhelmine Luebke is seen on the left of R. Natarajan. Prof. R. Krishnamurthi, in his article titled ‘3rd December 1962 – A Red-Letter Day’ in the Fourth Annual Number, writes: “Temporary gates and arches had been erected all along the roads to welcome the distinguished visitor. Even half-complete buildings put on fresh look. The open-air theatre, which had been got ready within a few weeks, was having the final touches given to it. The central stage as well as the arena displayed the national flags of both West Germany and India side by side. The Madras Police Band was in attendance. Paper and floral decorations and festoons were waving in the air in their multi-colours.”"
