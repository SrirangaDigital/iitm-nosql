    "Description": "The building shown here is the Officers’ Hostel, which later came to be known as the Taramani Guest House. It currently (as of January 2021) has 83 rooms (18 suite and 65 A/C). There are also currently two A/C dining halls with a capacity of 100 (70+30), an A/C conference hall for office meetings, lawn space for special occasions, and amenities on par with three star hotels. In the Souvenir Volume of 1962, Superintending Engineer Mr. Y. S. Ramaswamy writes “In addition to the 10 hostels for the students an Officers’ Hostel to accommodate 42 Officers has also been completed. The accommodation provided in the Officers’ Hostel is a single room. 12´ X 10´ for each Officer with an attached bathroom and a balcony. There is a common-room, a kitchen and a dining hall for all the 42 officers that are likely to stay in the hostel. This accommodation is meant especially for the Bachelor Members of the staff of the Institute and the staff and senior members who are likely to come from other Institutes for a short period either for seminars or refresher courses or for any other special meetings or discussions.”"
