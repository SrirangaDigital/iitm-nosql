    "Description": "In his article ‘The Campus’ in the Souvenir Volume of 1962, Superintending Engineer Y. S. Ramaswamy writes about the quarters that were being constructed on campus: “In the lay-out of the quarters efforts have been made to have a mixed colony, the houses for the Professors, Assistant Professors and Lecturers being intermingled with each other. Further, in the lay-out of each of the buildings, the natural ventilation aspect has been fully taken care of and most of the buildings are facing either the south or the east direction so that the natural ventilation is not obstructed. Another important aspect that has been considered in the lay-out of the quarters is the retention of as many of the trees as possible around each of the quarters.”"
