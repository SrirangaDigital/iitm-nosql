    "Description": "The Central Workshop (CWS) was established in 1959 as part of the Department of Mechanical Engineering. It was established with the support of Federal Republic of Germany, to train B.Tech. students in various shop floor techniques and fabrications. The Central Workshop was started with the association of Professor Lechner of the Technical University of Stuttgart. The CWS received the ISO 9001:2000 quality certification from RWTUV, Germany in 2001. Over the years, the CWS introduced modern facilities that better suited the training in line with current industrial requirements. The workshop training now includes foundry, welding, electrical, auto shop, instrument shop, tool room and gear inspection, numerically controlled (NC) machines, pneumatic &#38; hydraulic trainers, electronics, FRP and plastic laboratories, communication laboratories, in addition to carpentry, fitting, gear and machine shops. In the Souvenir Volume of 1962, Superintending Engineer Mr. Y. S. Ramaswamy writes: “This was one of the first constructions taken up when the Institute was started in the campus and the work on this workshop building was completed in June, 1961 and is in occupation since then. The workshop provides for 7 distinct halls for each of the various sections, namely, carpentry, foundry and smithy, fitting shop, machine shop, electrical shop, welding shop and production engineering. Each of the halls is 150´ x 50´ and has a R.C.C. shell roof construction.”"
