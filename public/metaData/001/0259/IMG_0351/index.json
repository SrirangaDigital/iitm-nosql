It is visible from the second floor of the Building Sciences Block, and is currently (as of January 2021) surrounded by various trees and plants. The writing is put together with bricks and cement. The structure is surrounded by shrubs in a decorative fashion (as of January 2021). The text, the motto of the institution, reads “Siddhirbhavati Karmajaa”. It means “Success is achieved through effort.” Siddhi means Success, Bhavati Means Through or Born of &#38; Karmajaa is the Karma or Effort. It is taken from Chapter 4, Verse 12 of the ‘Bhagavad Gita’. "
