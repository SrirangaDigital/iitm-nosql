    "Description": "Prof. Humayun Kabir was an educationist and politician. He also wrote poems, essays and novels in Bengali. In 1932, he was invited by Sarvepalli Radhakrishnan to join as a lecturer at the newly established Andhra University. He also served as Chairman of the University Grants Commission in Delhi. Prof. Humayun Kabir was the Minister of State for Civil Aviation, Education Minister of India twice, under the Prime Ministerships of Jawaharlal Nehru and Lal Bahadur Shastri. Apart from this, He was also Scientific Research and Cultural Affairs Minister. He was a renowned orator. In his speech, according to Prof. R. Krishnamurthi’s article in the Fourth Annual Number: “Professor Humayun Kabir referred with appreciation to the work done already during these three years to bring this Institute to its high level of efficiency. A city was rapidly growing up in the campus, dedicated to the pursuit of knowledge and to the development of Science and Technology. He recalled how India has owed a great deal to Germany through the years, and how German scholars have been among the greatest interpreters of Indian Culture to the Western World. He paid a glowing tribute to the German people for the wonderful way in which they have re-built their cities and their economy, which had been shattered by World War II. He acknowledged with gratitude how Germany has been giving many evidences of her good will towards the developing country, India, and how this Institute is probably the most important of all such acts of help. He praised German scholarship for its high standards, and for its thoroughness and attention to details. The Indians are well known for their imaginative and speculative achievements.  He expressed the hope that in this Institute at Madras there will be a marriage between these qualities in the cause of peace, and for the service of man. He thanked Dr. A. L. Mudaliar and Dr. Kraus for their abiding interest in the growth and welfare of this Institute, and then requested His Excellency Dr. Heinrich Luebke to lay the corner stone of the Indian Institute of Technology, Madras.” Prof. Humayun Kabir formally inaugurated the institute in 1959, three years prior to his visit as seen in the photograph (1962)."
