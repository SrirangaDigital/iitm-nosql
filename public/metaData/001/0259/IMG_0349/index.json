    "Description": "R. Natarajan, the first Registrar of IIT Madras, is one of the key figures who played a significant role in the inception of the Institute during the initial stages. He served as the Registrar from 1959 to 1965. Known for his “genial and smiling countenance”, as M. Vikram Rao puts it in his article in a 1963 edition of Campastimes, Natarajan was a keen administrator of the Institute."
