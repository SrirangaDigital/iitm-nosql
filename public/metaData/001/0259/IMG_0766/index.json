    "Description": "The building in the photograph appears to be a C type building. It is likely that it is building C-34, although this cannot be ascertained. It is located on 2nd Cross Road. In the Souvenir Volume of 1962, Superintending Engineer Mr. Y. S. Ramaswamy writes “The residential quarters are being located as near to the main Guindy-Adyar Road as possible in order to give easy access to the occupants of the quarters to the main-road, the State Transport etc. In the lay-out of the quarters efforts have been made to have a mixed colony, the houses for the Professors, Assistant Professors and Lecturers being intermingled with each other.” According to Mr. Y. S. Ramaswamy, 20 Professors’ quarters were to be built as a part of the first phase of construction."
