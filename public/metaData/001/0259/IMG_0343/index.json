    "Description": "The building in the photograph has been identified as the Warden’s quarters (number 1). It currently serves as the NCC office, and it is located behind Himalaya Student’s Mess. Compared to the photograph, the area surrounding the building is currently (as of April 2021) surrounded by plenty of trees. In the Souvenir Volume of 1962, Superintending Engineer Mr. Y. S. Ramaswamy writes “The residential quarters are being located as near to the main Guindy-Adyar Road as possible in order to give easy access to the occupants of the quarters to the main-road, the State Transport etc. In the lay-out of the quarters efforts have been made to have a mixed colony, the houses for the Professors, Assistant Professors and Lecturers being intermingled with each other.” According to Mr. Y. S. Ramaswamy, 20 Professors’ quarters were to be built as a part of the first phase of construction."
