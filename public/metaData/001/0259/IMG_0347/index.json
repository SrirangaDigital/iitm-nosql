In the Fourth Annual Number, Prof. R. Krishnamurthi’s article ‘3rd December 1962 – A Red-Letter Day’ talks about the proceedings of the event: “At exactly 4:30 p.m., the West German President and Mrs. Luebke entered the dais. With a pleasant smile, Dr. Luebke got on the platform followed by Mrs. Luebke, Dr. A. L. Mudaliar, Profesor Humayun Kabir, Chief Minister Kamaraj, Sri. R. Venkataraman (Minister in-charge of Industries and Technical Education with the Government of Madras), Professor Sengupto, Mr. R. Natarajan, the Registrar and the Superintending Engineer, Mr. Y. S. Ramaswamy.” He goes on to write about the stone laying ceremony. The function began with prayers, a speech by Dr. A. L. Mudaliar, a speech by Mr. R. Natarajan, an address by Prof. Humayun Kabir and finally the President Dr. Luebke laid the foundation stone, following which he gave a speech. The shadow of the photographer falls on the floor of the stage. Since the photograph was taken by C. Gowrishankar, it is likely that it is his shadow."
