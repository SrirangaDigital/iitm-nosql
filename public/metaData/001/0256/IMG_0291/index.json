Dr. Mudaliar later served as Vice Chancellor of Madras University for a period of 27 years. He was also the Deputy Leader of the Indian delegation to the First World Health Assembly in Geneva in 1948. Following this, Mudaliar was elected as the chairman of the World Health Organization (WHO) Executive Board in 1949 and 1950. Apart from this, Mudaliar was knighted in the 1945 New Year Honours. In 1954, he was awarded the Padma Bhushan and the Padma Vibhushan in 1963. In the photograph, one can observe a number of cars parked. The car on the left with its rear facing the camera is the Standard Super 10, which used to be manufactured in India under license at Vandalur Standard Motors factory. The car to the right of the Standard Super 10 (front facing camera) is possibly another Standard 10, also called Pennant. Out of the three cars on the right, the white coloured car in the middle could be a Hindustan Motors Landmaster, which is a predecessor to the Ambassador. To the left of the Landmaster is yet another Standard 10. The car on the extreme right is yet to be identified. (Identified by Mr. K. V. Sudhakar)."
