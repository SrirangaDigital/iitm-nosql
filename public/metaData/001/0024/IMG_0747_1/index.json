    "Description": "The speech delivered by Dr. C. V. Raman was rather instructive as he spoke at length about the dark side of science and about the unnecessary developments taking place that leads us away from the essence of science. His speech also had nuances of nostalgia to it as he recalls his own college days. He said, “Fully sixty years ago, I came out of College in this very city. I find to my astonishment, that my experiences of those four years have left an indelible impression on my mind and what is more remarkable is that all that I have done in the last sixty years was determined for me with mathematical precision by what I did in those four years”. His speech took an interesting turn when he revealed that he had been at the very birth of IITM, 10 years prior when he happened to be in Bonn and by coincidence so was the first Prime Minister of India, Shri Jawaharlal Nehru. He recalls the lunch they shared with the President of the German Republic, “It was on this occasion that the German Government promised their gift of this Institute to India. And in a short span of 10 years, a veritable jungle has been translated into a place of learning with its fine buildings and equipment and bright, young people from all over India, and here such a magnificent assembly has been presented for my delectation”. On the dias, next to Sir C.V. Raman, from the left; Dr. A.L. Mudaliar, Rajah Sir Muthiah Chettiar, Dr. K.S.G. Doss, Prof. S. Sampath (Head of the Electrical Engineering department)."
