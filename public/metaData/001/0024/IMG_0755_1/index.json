    "Description": "Prof. Bibhuti Bhushan Sengupto (1905-1983) acquired his early education from Benaras Hindu University, which was amongst the first few universities in India and also one of the earliest universities offering Engineering education. He later went to Manchester for his further education. Upon returning from the UK, he joined the Victoris Jubilee Technical Institute - VJTI and rose to become the first Principal of the Institute. He oversaw the conversion of VJTI into a college of high repute in the 1940â€™s, as he facilitated provision of degrees in Engineering, becoming only the second such college after School of Engineering at Pune in Western India. Prof. Sengupto also served as a Secretary to a high level committee for the upgrade and spread of higher technical education in India. Prof B. B. Sengupto was selected as the founder Director of IIT Madras in 1958, and joined IIT Madras in 1959. He set up several teams and worked at break neck speed, and in just 5 years from 1959 to 1964, the institute was set up, with separate buildings for the various faculties, several large workshops and laboratories, libraray, hostels for students, living quarters for the teaching and many non- teaching staff, roads, an Open Air Theatre, and also a school for the children of the staff. Prof. Sengupto retired from IIT Madras in 1967."
