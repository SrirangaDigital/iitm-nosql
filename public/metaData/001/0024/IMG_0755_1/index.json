    "Description": "Prof. Bibhutibhushan Sengupto (1905-1983) acquired his early education from Benaras Hindu University, which was amongst the first universities in India and one of the earliest universities to offer Engineering education. Later, Prof. Sengupto went to Manchester for his further education. Upon returning from the UK, he joined the Victoris Jubilee Technical Institute (VJTI) and rose to become the first Principal of the Institute. He oversaw the conversion of VJTI into a college of high repute in the 1940â€™s, as he facilitated awarding of degrees in engineering. VJTI became the second such college in Western India after the School of Engineering at Pune. Prof. Sengupto served as the Secretary of a high level committee for the upgrade and spread of higher technical education in India. Prof B. Sengupto was selected as the founder Director of IIT Madras in 1958, and he joined IIT Madras in 1959. He set up several teams and worked at break-neck speed, and in just 5 years from 1959 to 1964, the institute was set up, with separate buildings for the various faculties, several large workshops, laboratories, a library, hostels for students, living quarters for the teaching and non- teaching staff members, roads, an open air theatre, and a school for the children of the staff. Prof. Sengupto retired from IIT Madras in 1967. In the photo, Prof. B. Sengupto presents Ms. N. Chandralekha her M.Sc. (Mathematics). She graduated with distinction. A total of 38 students (1965 and 1966) received their M.Sc. degrees during the third convocation."
