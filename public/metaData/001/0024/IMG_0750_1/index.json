    "Photographer": "Mr. C. Gourishankar (1936-2002) was a multi disciplinarian. Geologist, photographer, writer, craftsman and artist are just some of the definitions that can be given to this man of versatile interests and professions. Above all, he was a perfectionist. Gourishankar was first introduced to photography as a child. He would often observe his father, a photo enthusiast himself, taking photographs, developing and printing them at home. Gourishankar’s passion was Temple Photography but his rapture for photography in general drove him to read extensively and collect more knowledge on the subject. In 1960, he took up Photography as a profession.  Gourishankar started off by doing Event Photography and Industrial Photography. As an industrial photographer he took Black and White photographs of factories, buildings and machinery for a number of Institutions. One such institution was the Indian Institute of Technology, Madras. All through the 1960’s-70’s buildings and facilities mushroomed all over the campus. The campus was amok with dignitaries, German professors and plenty of activity, convocations and other such events. This is when Gourishankar stepped in to document these radical changes taking place. His first assignment at IIT Madras was to cover the Institute Day function, April 1961. Besides taking commissioned photographs, he continued taking photographs of South Indian Iconography. Many of his photos were greatly demanded and he printed and sold many copies of them. His photographs were showcased in exhibitions held at many places including the Madras Museum, the German Consulate and Alliance Francaise."
