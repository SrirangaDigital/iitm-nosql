    "Description": "The Guard of Honour was a convocation tradition at IITM. After being received by the institute director and registrar, the chief guest would be presented a Guard of Honour by the N.C.C. (National Cadet Corps) cadets. The chief guest would inspect the guard along with the N. C. C. prof. in charge. Here Sir C.V. Raman inspects the Guard of Honour along with 2/Lt. G. V. N. Rayudu. A few N.C.C. events that had taken place over the prior months were the N.C.C. Day parade (14th December, 1965), EME Camp at Bangalore and a tank attack demonstration with air support that took place on the Institute grounds."
