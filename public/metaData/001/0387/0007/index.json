    "Description": "Salim Ali and S. Dillon Ripley write about the feeding habits of the bird: “In the feverish jostling during the communal hunts, in which densely packed rabbles participate, the birds often leap-frog over their fellows in their eagerness to plunge after a shoal of fish-manoeuvres reminiscent of starlings at a swarm of grasshopper nymphs.”  The authors explain: “When not on water, usually seen perched upright on trees, stakes, or rocks, sunning themselves, wings and tail spread open.”"
