    "Caption": "Pond Heron [Ardeola grayii]",
    "Description": "Salim Ali and S. Dillon Ripley describe the bird as “An egret-like waterside bird largely snow-white and prominent when in flight, effectively camouflaged earthy brown when at rest.” The bird mainly feeds on frogs, fish, crustaceans and water beetles. The Pond Heron is also known as the Paddy Bird as they are often found in paddy fields foraging for small insects and crustaceans. The bird has a habit of standing still until the very last moment before flying when approached by people which has led people to believe that the bird is short sighted. Interestingly, the Sri Lankan name for the bird kana koka translates to ‘half-blind heron’."
