    "Description": "The Rose-ringed Parakeet is a common bird, characterised by its bright green plumage and long slender tail. The male has a rose coloured neck ring. The female does not have a distinct collar like that of the male, but a dull emerald-green collar. The juveniles resemble adult females, but the former brand a yellower plumage. These parakeets are noisy and social and nest in the hollows of trees, and occasionally in buildings."
