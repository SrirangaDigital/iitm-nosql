    "Description": "Salim Ali and S. Dillon Ripley note that the female koel is (above) “dark brown, profusely white-spotted and barred. Tail-feathers and wing-quills barred with white”, and (below) “white; spotted on chin, throat and foreneck, barred on rest of underparts with blackish.” The male Koel is described by Ali and Ripley as “glistening metallic black all over, with yellowish green bill and crimson eyes.”  The koel belongs to the cuckoo family (Cuculidae). Many cuckoos have a habit of laying their eggs in the nests of other species and not building any nests themselves."
