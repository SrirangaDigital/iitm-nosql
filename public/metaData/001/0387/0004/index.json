    "Caption": "Small Blue Kingfisher [Alcedo atthis]",
    "Description": "The Small Blue Kingfisher is also known as the Common Kingfisher. It measures around 16 cm with a wingspan of 25 cm. Ali and Ripley write that the bird is “usually met singly or in pairs perched on some favourite stake or bund on the edge of water.” The hunting habits are described thus: “Suddenly nose-dives with a splash and disappears under, presently to emerge with a small fish held crosswise in the bill. Flies off with the quarry at top speed to another perch some distance away where the struggling victim is battered into submission and swallowed head foremost.”"
