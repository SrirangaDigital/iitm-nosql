    "Description": "The Indian Moorhen is also known as the Common Moorhen. It has a black/dark brown plumage and a white undertail. It has a red bill with a yellow tip. Their legs are slightly long and toes are large. The toes are yellow in colour. They are found in marshy areas and feed on plant matter such as algae, moss, shoots and so on. They are also known to feed on small fish, invertebrates, aquatic insects, and so on. According to Ali and Ripley the Indian Moorhen “spends most of its time on the water, paddling about amongst the lily pads and other floating vegetation.”"
