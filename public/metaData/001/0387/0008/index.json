    "Caption": "Indian Pitta [Pitta brachyura]",
    "Description": "According to Prince Frederick’s article ‘Following the Indian Pitta from the Himalayan foothills to IIT Madras’ published in The Hindu (10th January 2021), “IIT-M has Indian Pittas coming out of its ears. Hyperbole apart, this bird is found in impressive numbers on this campus, especially at the height of the wintering season.” Salim Ali and S. Dillon Ripley describe the call of the bird as “a loud clear double whistle wheeet-tieu or wieet-piyou uttered mostly in the early morning and late evening.” Interestingly, the bird is called the ‘six-o-clock bird’."
