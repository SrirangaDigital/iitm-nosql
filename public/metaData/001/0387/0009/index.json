    "Description": "The White-browed Bulbul is one of the Bulbuls without a crest. It approximately measures 20 cm with a tail that is around 8 cm. It is described by Salim Ali and S. Dillon Ripley to be “very shy and skulking, more often heard than seen as it seems to prefer dense thickets.” The bird, according to Ali and Ripley, feeds on fruits, berries and flower-nectar, and also spiders and insects."
