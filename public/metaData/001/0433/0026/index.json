    "Caption": "Spotted Owlet [Athene brama]",
    "Description": "The Spotted Owlet is a nocturnal bird but sometimes seen during the day. It measures around 20 cm. Salim Ali and S. Dillon Ripley note that “every venerable banyan, tamarind or mango tree will hold a resident pair or two of these little owls, and one has but to tap on the trunk to bring up an inquiring and surprised little staring face to the entrance of a hollow, or dislodge a pair from some shady recess.”"
