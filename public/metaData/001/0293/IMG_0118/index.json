    "Description": "On the dais: (from left) Mr. C. Subramaniam, Dr. A. L. Mudaliar, Prof. B. Sengupto and dignitary (yet to be identified). Mr R. Natarajan, the Registrar, was known for his oratorical skills. His speeches and articles both were eloquently presented. His popular articles centred on the game of cricket are available in various Annual Numbers, and several other publications. Judging by the amused look on the faces of the dignitaries at the dais, we can assume that Mr. R. Natarajan may have infused a joke or two in his speech. In an Oral History Narrative interview conducted and documented by the Heritage Centre of IIT Madras, Mr. Mahadevan of the first batch of IIT Madras talks about Mr. R. Natarajan’s Institute Day talks: “The highlight of the Institute Day, always used to be his talk. He will talk for about half an hour, and absolutely marvellous oration, he used to give. People used to just stay back only to listen to him.”"
