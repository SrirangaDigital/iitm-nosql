    "Description": "Mr. Ebert was an expert workshop staff member. H. J. Ebert was born at Stuttgart in 1931. In 1948, he completed his schooling with an examination similar to that of Senior Cambridge, subsequently serving his apprenticeship as toolmaker in an instruments and controls factory for three and a half years passing the final examination conducted by the Chamber of Industry and Commerce, as a skilled toolmaker. Following this, he worked as a special mechanic for research work in control instruments for two and a half years, later as a supervisor and ‘Meister’ (superintendent) of the apprentice workshop for another four and a quarter years. From 1957 to 1958, he underwent a course for shopmasters and obtained the Chamber of Trade Certificate for Mechanical Shopmaster (examiner and superintendent of apprentices in mechanics, fine mechanics and toolmakers cadres). In 1959, he worked for three months as a planner for I.I.T. Madras on the staff of Prof. Dr. R. A. Kraus at Bonn. Mr. Ebert, expert staff member, workshops, joined the institute on 14th April 1959. R. Natarajan, the first Registrar of IIT Madras, is one of the key figures who played a significant role in the inception of the Institute during the initial stages. He served as the Registrar from 1959 to 1965. Known for his “genial and smiling countenance”, as M. Vikram Rao puts it in his article in a 1963 edition of Campastimes, Natarajan was a keen administrator of the Institute."
