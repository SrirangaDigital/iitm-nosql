    "Description": "One can note the open structured Cauvery Hostel in the background. The initial hostels were built in this fashion. The later hostels were built as quadrangles. The shadow of the photographer (C. Gourishankar) falls on the ground. It appears that he used a flash while taking the photograph, which is suggested by the shadow."
