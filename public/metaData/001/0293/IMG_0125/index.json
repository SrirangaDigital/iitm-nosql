    "Description": "From right: the girl character (first from right) is played by Mr. B. Ramachandra Pai. The person to the extreme right is possibly C. Krishna (yet to be confirmed). (Identification by Mr. Anand Singh Bawa and Mr. K. Narayanan). It was common for male students to don the roles and costumes of female characters owing to the fact that there were no female students in IIT Madras at the time. (Identification by Mr. Anand Singh Bawa and Mr. K. Narayanan)."
