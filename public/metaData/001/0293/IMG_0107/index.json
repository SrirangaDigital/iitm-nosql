    "Description": "Anand Singh Bawa was one of the people who established the popular magazine ‘Campastimes’. He was also the first editor of the same. Prior to setting up the magazine, Bawa had also edited the Annual Number. In the ‘iitian cariCATures’ section of the 15th September 1962 edition of ‘Campastimes’, M. V. R writes about Anand Singh Bawa. The droll descriptions of Bawa provides some details of the ‘Campastimes’ editor. Bawa served as the Hostel Secretary for Cauveri Hostel, and is represented as someone who maintains “coolness on all occasions”. He is also described as having a “ponderous” personality. Bawa was a part of the Riding Club and also the Boat Club. It appears Bawa’s scooter was a popular mode of transport for many of those staying in Cauveri Hostel."
