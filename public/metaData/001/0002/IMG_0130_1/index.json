    "Description": "This was the official invitation to the convocation. The front page (shown here) measures 17.5 cm by 12.5 cm. The font used is Wedding Regular. The font comes under the Wedding Text font family and was designed by Morris Fuller Benton in 1901. The font soon became popular and was used under several names by various people. Due to it being highly ornamental, and not very legible, its use is restricted to headlines and shorter texts."
