    "Caption": "Guindy hostel in 1959",
    "Description": "The Guindy Hostel, unlike its Saidapet counterpart, served non-vegetarian food. While the Saidapet Hostel accommodated eighty students, the Guindy hostel had forty. The hostels began functioning on 20th July 1959, two days before classes began. Dr. D. Venkateswarlu was probably the warden of the hostels at the time. The hostel cost the students around 75 rupees per month, inclusive of non-vegetarian food, which at the time was a reasonably high amount. The rooms were furnished with a steel cot, a table, a chair and a table lamp. Both the Saidapet and Guindy hostels had a carrom board and table tennis table. The first IITians set up volleyball and badminton courts around the hostels. Students would either walk, or cycle to college from the hostels in order to get to classes, which were held at A. C. College of Technology."
