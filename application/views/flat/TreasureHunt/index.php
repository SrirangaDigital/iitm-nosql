    <p>Enjoy 40 minutes of treasure hunt fun exploration from your mobiles with family and friends. You will need to crack 18-odd questions (puzzles/riddles/video clues and others). Of course, some of you may need more than 40 mins while others will ace it in much lesser time. And exciting prizes for the top scorers.</p>
